        "content": "It's been a while since I've last written. Life is moving forward. The seasons are changing, the kids are growing. It's strange to be in a time and place where my mom does not exist. Sometimes I watch the news or hop onto social media and I think about how lucky she was to never have to see some of the ugliness and craziness going on in the world. If everything I've been taught is true, then she's in a glorious place where sorrow and ugly doesn't exist. Other times I am left feeling sorry that she never got to grow old; she never got to watch her grandkids grow, and see all that they are accomplishing. She missed out on the golden years with my dad. There's an emptiness in our lives without her.Sometimes I wonder what life would be like if Mom were still here. Who would I be? What would I be doing? I sometimes find myself imagining what I'd be doing right now if Mom were still with us. I imagine the two of us making our shopping list for our upcoming RV trip to Lake Pleasant. I imagine sitting together in church, my youngest sitting on her lap while she looks at books with him and tries to keep him quiet and reverent. I imagine her marveling at Ryder's most recent tooth that he lost and remarking what a big boy he is becoming. I imagine that I'd be saving a seat for her at the boy's talent show. I would look over at her and she would have that huge grin that she used to get when she was beaming with pride. She would be so proud of their courage for getting up on stage, and of Cody's amazing talent with his guitar. I imagine her cheering above every other voice in the room, \"that's my girl!\" when Aubrey takes the stage to sing, just like she did when it was one of her daughter's on stage.I imagine my kids having sleepovers at grandma's house while Jeff and I go out on a date night. She and dad would probably be spoiling them with trips to the movies or the fair, like they used to do B.D. I imagine myself, picking up the phone to call her and vent to her about the teenage attitude I'm dealing with, or to ask for recipe tips or advice on any given topic.If Mom were still here, I wonder how I would fill my days now that all the kids are in school. I imagine that I would be the mom that is at the school all the time, volunteering in the classroom, joining the PTA, running all the activities. Maybe I would put more time and effort in to my home sewing business. I wouldn't have so many distractions- a foundation to run, blogs to write, tears to wipe.My course in life has certainly been changed by dementia and by the tragic loss of my mom. It has changed the person that I am. The ambitions and goals of my younger self are not the same as they are today and life can never be how it would have been if Mom were here. Now that she is gone, I can't go back to who I once was.And yet, I'm not sure if I'd want to go back to that person. On one hand, I have much more sadness in my life now. The rose colored glasses have come off and I see things in a different light now; not just my own sorrows and struggles, but that of others as well. My heart hurts for what I've been through and it hurts for what I see others going through. There are some days where I feel completely unhinged and unstable and I struggle with the dark cloud of sadness that often hovers overhead. But, on the other hand, I've heard it said that you can't truly feel joy without having felt pain, and I feel like I appreciate the little things in life so much more. Going through this has definitely made me a more empathetic person. I feel that I am better able to relate to others experiencing loss because I have felt what it's like to have my own heart ripped in two. I am more aware of other's needs and things I might be able to do to lighten their burden. B.D.(Before Dementia), I would have never imagined myself doing some of the things I've had to do; giving up my time to provide care for someone other than my kids, changing diapers, aiding and comforting someone in their last moments in life, preparing them with all the love and tenderness that one can muster for their final departure of this life. All of those things required sacrifice and they were not always easy or convenient, but I am better off for having learned those little lessons of love. Love means sacrifice and I'm not so sure I completely understood that B.D.  My relationships with family members and friends would not be the same either. My dad and I have always had a good relationship, but I feel as though we have grown a lot closer over the past several years. We have leaned on one another to get through this. We've had some deep and meaningful conversations and I have found myself turning to him for advice many times. My love and respect for him has only grown deeper by his example of unconditional love and care for my mom and for his entire family. I have always considered myself to have had good relationships with my family, but when my mom got sick, there were a couple of aunts who became like second mothers to me. After my mom was diagnosed, one of my aunts (who lives long distance) started calling me every now and then, just to chit-chat. We'd never really had that kind of relationship before, but the more and more she called, the more I came to see that I had someone else there for me, ready to listen. Now, we talk on the phone at least a couple of times a week, if not more. She's become a mother figure to me and our relationship has become very special and dear to me. I have another aunt who I've grown closer with as well. She was the aunt I used to spend the night with growing up, so we've always been close. But since my mom has been sick, we make more of an effort to have regular family dinners and get together here and there \"just because\" or to celebrate birthdays. She and my uncle make an effort to be at the kid's concerts and events and I know that both of these aunts are always be there for me in a heartbeat when I need anything. In fact, they are the ones who I leaned on the most the week my mom died. I don't know that these relationships would be quite the same if dementia hadn't have crossed our path. Because of dementia, I have had to learn patience and forgiveness, both for myself and with others (this is a never ending lesson!). I have learned to rely on and trust in other people. My mom was always my \"go to\" person, but by opening myself to talking and confiding with other people, my relationships with them have grown stronger and I have discovered a whole \"community\" of people that I feel a part of. So many people have shown love and support over the years; family and friends alike rallied together to help our family during years of hardship. I had friends who had never even met my mom B.D., but were still at her funeral and serving us through our darkest times. Their examples of friendship have truly inspired me and makes me want to be a better friend and person.  I hate that it took losing my mom to grow into the person I have become, yet there is also a sense of beauty in bettering one self in spite of trials. I can't really say if I am truly better or not, since I don't know the person I would be if this had never happened, but I'd like to think that there are ways that I've learned and grown through this. Lately I have been struggling with myself; feelings of sadness and inadequacy have been creeping in; feeling a bit lost and confused about which path to take in this stage of my earthly journey (another post for another day). Sometimes I wish I could turn back time and go back to a simpler time of life. But I am trying to focus on the beauty rather than the pain and trying to live a life that my mom would be proud of.  ",

        "content": "It is with a heavy heart that I write this post to let you all know that my dear mother passed away this morning at 6:40. Our prayers were heard in that it was a peaceful passing; there was no gurgling or gasping for air, her heart and her breathing just gradually slowed to a stop. She had her 3 children, beloved husband, daughter-in-law, sister-in-law and oldest grandson by her side as she took her last breath. Afterwards, her siblings and other family members and in-laws (and grandchildren) all surrounded with her love in her home. A close friend and clergyman from our church came over as soon as he heard the news and left our family with a sweet prayer as we all crammed into her bedroom by her bedside. While I know that she is freed from her pain and suffering, and I know that she is having a beautiful reunion right now with her parents and other loved ones, we are all left broken hearted. This cruel disease took her from us way before her time. Her departure from us leaves a huge hole that can never be filled. Thank you all for your prayers (I believe they did make a difference) and all of the thoughts and words of comforts. Thank you to those who came to visit with us this week and give my mom love before she left. Thank you for the dinners and the goodies left on the porch. We are blessed to have so many wonderful people in our lives to help us through our grief. I will post an update as soon as we confirm funeral services (which will likely be done on Monday). I can say that we are aiming for the 11th or 12th of August, due to the fact that my cousin is getting married (in another state) next weekend and we don't want to take anything away from her special day. I will post an update as soon as we know so that friends and family members from out of town can make arrangements to be here to honor my mom. ",

        "content": "Mom is still hanging on. She is one heck of a fighter. She has been sleeping (comatose) for over 48 hours now (not counting the 12 hours before her abrupt waking on Wednesday morning). Up until last night, her breathing was 6 breaths a minute but it has changed to more shallow breathing with short periods of apnea in between. There have been a few times where she has gotten gurgley (when we've moved her or given her meds). It's a little scary to hear her when she gets like that. She has had a fever for the past few days which has been rising daily. The Tylenol hasn't been helping to manage it at all. Today, it climbed up to 102.5, so we made some ice packs to put under her armpits and neck to help cool her off. Despite the fever, her feet and extremities are cold. We haven't been able to get a blood pressure reading on her arm today either. The nurse came to visit today (we've had nurses' visits daily) and she explained to us that the fevers, cold extremities and inability to read the blood pressure is due to the recirculation of blood. As her body is shutting down, the blood is circulating more to the vital organs (in her core) and is basically being cut off from the other parts of her body. Because of all of this added work on her heart, her pulse is up to 135. The nurse was very compassionate and spent some time with us explaining the process and asking if we had any questions (we've had Aunt Sharon with us for most of the week, and she's already explained all of this to us so we already understood her condition). When she left, she said she'd see me at our next scheduled appointment on Monday, but that she honestly didn't think Mom would still be here by then. The good thing, the nurse said, is that she seems to be at peace. She doesn't appear to be in pain; she is in a content, deep sleep. She is surrounded by many family members and friends who love her. It is now up to her when she wants to go.Mom has had a lot of visitors this week and it's been sweet to see the friends and family who have come to give their good-byes. We've had family members fly in from out of town and she even had her high school friend, Cheryl, drive 7 hours this past weekend just to spend one afternoon with her. All of her caregivers have come to spend time with her, all of her siblings, some friends from church. All week has been a family sleepover with grandkids who don't want to leave and her kids all around her. Even though it may seem like she doesn't know what is going on, her eyelids will sometimes twitch when someone speaks to her. I do believe she hears us and knows that we are all here. That's probably why she's still here-she's enjoying all this love that she's been receiving. ",

        "content": "I didn't get a post up last night because, in all honesty, we thought her time was close and we were all gathered around her into the early hours of the morning (until we all started passing out ourselves from sheer exhaustion of the past few days).After my last post on Tuesday night, we went to turn Mom, who had been in a deep, unmoving sleep for hours, and she was non-responsive. She was still breathing, but it had become labored and she was only taking 6 apnea-like breaths a minute. She was running a low grade fever and she didn't even flinch when we touched or tried to move her. We gave her a Tylenol suppository, checked her blood pressure, moved her body, changed her diaper...and absolutely no response to any of these things. By all accounts, she seemed completely comatose. I called the hospice nurse helpline and they sent out a nurse to check on her. The nurse arrived around 11:00 pm and I could tell by the look on her face that she was concerned. I could tell that she was choosing her words carefully and hesitant to say what she was thinking so I told her that we understood what the breathing meant. She got tears in her eyes and told us that she was so sorry. She felt that, in the state she was in, she was likely to go by the next day (yesterday). By the time we were finished talking and assessing, it was midnight, and I sent out some texts to her siblings to let them know, in case anyone wanted to be by her side. I called my brother so he would know to get here soon (my sister had already come over just before the nurse got there). I also called Aunt Sharon, who had been here earlier in the day and wanted to know if anything changed. She and Uncle Tim came over right away (and she's been here ever since, as Mom's personal RN).None of us got any sleep that night. We each took turns to have a private moment with Mom to say whatever we wanted to say to her. We sat by Mom's side and held her hands...and just waited. All of the sudden, at 5:30 in the morning, Mom woke up and almost immediately started trying to get up, but she hardly had the strength to sit up (it required someone sitting behind her to hold her up). She became very agitated and restless and was looking around at each person in the room. At different times, she would grab our hands, one time she looked at me and brought her hand up to my face. Other times, she would stare intently at different spaces in the room where nobody was sitting, yet it seemed that she was looking at someone. [There was also a moment earlier in the day where she rolled over in her bed and stared straight into my empty rocking chair (I had moved to her bed to rub her legs). She looked right where I'd been sitting and then slowly reached out her hand to the armrest, just like she had been reaching out for our hands throughout the day]. She also kept pointing to the corner of the room and fixing her gaze there. Sometimes, her face looked pained and she kept trying to turn over to get comfortable. We gave her some meds to try and calm her but she wasn't settling down. The nurse came by again and gave her a stronger medication to help her relax and finally, around 11:00, she curled up in her corner again and went back to sleep.My brother got in at noon and spent time by Mom's side, rubbing her arm and stroking her hair. Mom had some visitors trickle in throughout the day, including a couple of her caregivers who have been relieved of their duties but still wanted to be with Mom (they've come to love her over the time they've cared for her). Her bathing nurse also made a visit and we gave her a bed bath. She slept through it, although she was a little more responsive his time around as she kept trying to turn back over on her side. Her breathing remained the same throughout the day, 6 breaths a minute. She didn't wake up again, but she seemed to be comfortable and not feeling any pain. That evening, a family friend (and Ecclesiastical leader from our church) came to visit our family. He gave my mom a sweet prayer blessing, blessing her with the comfort to know that her family is here and loves her, that we will be okay and lean on each other to get through this. He told her that there are angels on the other side, family members who are waiting to help her on both sides. He also left my dad and me with a prayer and blessing of strength and comfort to get through what is to come. It was a nice visit and he left us (or at least me, since I can only speak for myself) with comfort and a little more peace. The anxiety and knots in my stomach that I have been feeling for the past couple of days have finally settled. I needed that prayer.Later that night, we rolled Mom to a new position and heard some rattling in her chest. Her pulse has gotten weaker and Aunt Sharon felt like she was getting closer to the end. We all gathered around her bedside: my dad laying by her side and her kids and grandkids surrounding her and rubbing her and holding her hands. We stayed like that for a couple of hours, until the exhaustion of the past few days became too much and we started to fall asleep, one by one. The kids retreated to their campout on the living room floor, my brother and his wife took the bed across the hall from mom, and the rest of us crashed on Mom's floor or in chairs. Dad didn't move from her side on the bed. Throughout the night, we all awoke at different times to check on her. Miraculously, she is still here with us this morning. Her brother flies in from Pennsylvania at 1:00 this afternoon, and I told her a few day ago that he would be here. They were very close throughout their lives and he's the only sibling that hasn't been here to give his good-bye. I do believe that she hears us and knows us at this state and several of us feel like maybe she is waiting for her brother. We also have a couple other family members coming (my daughter comes at 4:00 today and my Aunt Peggy, dad's sister, comes at 7 am tomorrow). When Mom is ready, she's ready. Until then, we are keeping her comfortable and cherishing our last moments to love on her in this life.",

        "content": "The day started at 1:00 this morning; I was startled awake by the sound of Mom coughing next to me. I popped out of my chair and she was coughing stuff out of her mouth. Because she can't swallow, the medicine residue and saliva had built up and she was (luckily) coughing it out. I called out for Dad, who wasn't on his air mattress beside her. Of course she waited for the moment he went to the bathroom to do this. After the incident, dad slept beside her on her hospital bed. I don't think the nurse did a good enough job explaining this part to me. I don't know what I was expecting, but I wasn't really expecting all of those secretions and since then we have been diligent about swabbing her mouth to remove the excess residue. By 4:00 am, Mom tried to sit up. This time it was with a lot of effort. She became very restless, laying down and then sitting up, pointing to the doors (like maybe she wanted to go out for a walk). We gave her more meds but she was still restless for another hour and a half. I sat at the foot of her bed and rubbed her legs and feet in hopes of soothing her and that seemed to settle her down; she finally fell back asleep around 5:30. By 7:00, she was awake and restless yet again. She wasn't due for meds quite yet but she seemed very agitated, like maybe she was in pain. We gave her her next round of meds a little bit early and she tried to sit up again. She couldn't stand, but Dad was able to hold her into a standing position to give her a stretch and put her in the wheelchair; we thought maybe she'd like a little ride around the block. The morning air was cool and she did seem content as we pushed her up and down the street, but by the time we got home she looked ready to rest again. Throughout the day, this pattern of restlessness and agitation continued. She seemed uncomfortable and in pain. I spent a lot of time rubbing her body in hopes of calming her. She seemed to relax a lot more when people were touching or rubbing her. I brought my essential oils and used them on her legs and back, hoping her help her find relief. In the meantime, I had put a call in to the nurse, who made her way to the house around 10:30. She agreed that Mom seemed to be uncomfortable and in pain, so after consulting with the head nurse and doctor, they decided to up her dosage of morphine. It took a while to kick in and there were still spurts here and there where she would wake up and start turning in her bed. She wanted to keep sitting up, but by the end of the day, she was too weak to do it on her own :(By late afternoon, she finally settled down and fell into a sleep and I began to notice small changes in her breathing. My Aunt Sharon (the RN) also noticed. It is as if she is breathing in, holding for a few seconds, and then releasing. I know what this means. She has been laying in the same position for past 3 1/2 hours without flinching. I fear that when I am finished writing this post and go to try and turn her that she won't wake up from her sleep. I'm not gonna lie, I am really struggling today. Dad has been busying himself with cleaning up the house. I know it is extremely difficult for him to see her at this stage; he was hoping beyond hope that it wouldn't come to this. He was hoping for the miracle that she would go quietly in her sleep.  It is devastating to see her like this. My heart feels like it is breaking into two. I have prepared myself as much as I possibly could; I've read and learned all I could to mentally strengthen myself for this day and now that we are here, I am breaking. I don't know if my heart can take it. My brother drives back in tomorrow night. My Uncle Jeff, Mom's brother, flies in from Pennsylvania on Thursday. My daughter, Maurina, flies in Thursday afternoon and my Aunt Peggy early Friday morning. I am hoping that they each will have a chance to say good-bye. And I really need them here to help me get through this. I know my dad does, too. ",

        "content": "Some people have been texting and asking for updates on mom. I will try to be better and post updates daily or at least every other day. I know that friends and family who are far away want to be kept in the loop and it's easier to write one post than to make several calls and texts. We appreciate all of the texts, phone calls, visits, thoughts and prayers that we have received. Last night, we started Mom on morphine. It's been really difficult to determine if Mom is in pain, due to the fact that she can no longer communicate; even her expressions are gone. I've been trying to read up on kidney failure just to get an idea of signals to look for that could indicate that she's in pain (especially since the doctor said to expect it in the next few days). I stumbled onto a couple of websites that spelled out the 10 symptoms and she fits every single one. I think reason would say that she's in pain. For the past couple of days, she's been especially restless. She has been unable to lay down and sleep for more than a few minutes at a time and she looks completely exhausted. When she was finally laying down, I noticed her legs shaking/rocking, feet tapping and she would rub her hands over her face as if she's frustrated. Her skin has looked flushed and today, her cheeks are puffy (which, from what I understand, means that her kidneys are unable to excrete excess fluids, leading to swelling in other parts of her body). All of these signs lead me to believe that she is feeling pain, and how can she not when her kidneys are shutting down? The decision to administer the morphine hasn't been an easy one. My dad is worried about unnecessarily giving her meds and over-medicating her; he doesn't want her to become a \"zombie\". It's a scary step because it means we lose that last little bit of spark left in her. My Aunt Sharon (who is an ICU nurse) was over last night, and made the same observations that she might be uncomfortable at this stage. She talked to my dad and the decision was made to give her some morphine. It really has calmed her down and she has been able to rest so much more peacefully. The side effect, however, is grogginess while she is awake. She does still try to get up and walk around, but when she does we have to follow beside her because she is losing strength and becoming wobbly. It is painful to see her like this. But the thought of her being in pain is even worse. We are trying to take it day by day, hour by hour and adjust as needed.We put in a call for her hospital bed; it should be here by tomorrow. I think that will help her with getting up and down and put our minds at ease about her falling out of bed. Also, as much as we want to think it won't happen, she will probably not be ambulatory for much longer. We are making plans to have someone in her room with her at all times now, so that will mean taking shifts throughout the night. My sister-in-law and I dusted and tidied up her room today and I brought over some lavender oil to diffuse in her room. We've put on some of her favorite, calming instrumental CD's to play softly in the background. We are trying to keep her calm and relaxed through this process as much as possible.We have all been taking turns sitting beside her throughout the day. This afternoon, I sat next her and she had her blanket over her face (a funny thing she likes to do while she sleeps) and was seemingly asleep. All of the sudden, her hand slipped out from the blanket and felt for mine. Her body didn't stir, her eyes were still closed, but she firmly held onto my hand and pulled it up to her face. It was such a sweet moment, it brought me to tears. She knows that I'm here and I know that she feels comfort in being surrounded by so many people who love her.",

        "content": "I was halfway through writing another post, all about Mom's hospice assessment on Tuesday, but after events of this afternoon, all of those details seem long and drawn out and unnecessary; quite honestly I just don't have the energy for it all. To summarize the events of the past few days, Mom was put on hospice on Tuesday. We were a little surprised that they finally approved her, given that she's still ambulatory (the reason why we were rejected before). This time, we had a great nurse who listened and looked at all of the evidence (food logs, weight logs, etc) and pled our unique case to the doctor. They both agreed that she was appropriate to receive the service and we breathed a sigh of relief; finally, we are receiving help! The past couple of days have consisted of nursing visits (by both the RN as well as the bathing nurse), social workers and finally, today, a visit from the doctor himself. We were hoping for some insight from the doctor of what to expect in the coming weeks and possibly months, and I think that even though we knew what we were facing, we were still caught a little off guard with the news he delivered.To start with, Mom's eating and drinking has dwindled down to practically nothing. In fact, for the past 2 days she has only had a few bites and a few sips of water. She has been sleeping for long periods of time throughout the day; I'd guess that she's been sleeping close to 20 hours out of the day. We have noticed some blood in the urine bowl and dad wanted me to ask the doctor about that (dad had to work; the doctor was scheduled to come mid-morning so I told him that I'd be there to meet with him). The doctor arrived mid-afternoon. I'm very thankful that my brother and sister-in-law were there with me to speak to him, for support and also so they could hear what he had to say. When he arrived, the three of us went back to Mom's room with him so he could see her and talk about her situation. He had already reviewed the detailed notes given to him by the nurse and we filled him in on her lack of eating and drinking over the past couple of days. I also explained that she appeared to have blood in her urine. He started to tell us that she was in fact, shutting down, but he hadn't given us any kind of timeline at this point. My brother and I brought up our concerns and reservations about leaving on our upcoming family vacation (we had planned to travel to Colorado for my cousin's wedding in a couple of weeks). At that point, he gave it to us straight. He told us that we should not go anywhere. He then told us that we were probably looking at 2-3 weeks, a month at most. The blood in her urine indicates renal failure and he said that within a few days, her kidneys would likely be shutting down. After that, it will be a domino effect with her other organs. He told us to contact any family members or friends who would like to see her and to tie up any loose ends. He stood with us in silence as we absorbed the information and held back tears. We asked some more questions and he answered them all, very compassionately yet matter-of-factly. I have been feeling like the time is getting close, but I honestly wasn't expecting this news today. No sooner than the doctor drove up the street to leave than my dad drove down the street, arriving home from work. He asked if the doctor had any insight for us and that's about when I lost it. It was very difficult news to have to deliver. There was an initial shock and as you can imagine, this is very difficult news for everyone to come to terms with, but most especially my dad. After some time to let it all sink in, Dad asked me to call certain family members and friends for him. Please don't be offended if you didn't get a personal call from me; this has been a little overwhelming for me, too, and I asked some Aunts/Uncles to help me contact everyone. At this time, he really isn't up to talking to anyone on the phone. He gave me permission to give updates on this blog, but he is asking for friends and family members to please not make posts about this on Facebook; he would rather this be the one spot for people to get their information from. Also, it's just too hard for him to see these posts right now. While she is our Mom, our sister, our friend, she is his wife. As much as we love her, nobody can be hurting right now as much as my dad.  For those family members and friends who would like to visit with Mom, he is open to having visitors. I would suggest for those who want to do that to reach out to and coordinate with me so that we don't overwhelm Mom with too many visitors at one time. Thank you all for your thoughts and prayers throughout this journey and especially now, during this difficult time. ",

        "content": "I've gone back and forth about writing this post. I've written and re-written and debated if I was being overdramatic about the way things are going. I thought maybe things would improve and that Mom was just having a bad day (or two). But in the pit of my stomach, I know the tides are changing. We are entering the end stages of this disease. From the beginning, we've known that this illness would be terminal. The only question has been how it would play out. Many people are taken from pneumonia or other infections; others simply stop eating. It is the process the body goes through when shutting down. Over the past 8 months, Mom has lost over 60 pounds. Every month, and now every week, she is losing weight (she lost another 4 pounds last week). Her eating has gradually declined over the months. Last fall, she was eating full-sized pb&j sandwiches. Then she started only eating about half, so we were making her half-sized portions. Eventually, those were cut down to quarters. Over the past couple of weeks, those quarters became eighths, and finally, within the past couple of weeks, she isn't finishing the eighths. If we are lucky, she will take a couple of bites before getting up from the table and walking away. Many times (more and more) she will sit down to eat, watch us make the sandwich, and then stare blankly and eventually walk away without taking any bites. A couple of months ago, we started keeping her food log again where we write down the time and amount of food she eats. From there, we are able to see how much she is eating per day and even per week. Up until the week of June 17th, she was averaging about 3 1/2 sandwiches a day (give or take, depending on the day) and her weekly average was 21 sandwiches. A couple of weeks ago, that average changed to 15 sandwiches per week and for the past two weeks it's dropped down to 10-11 for the whole week. As I am typing this, I am sitting in her living room while she sleeps in her room. It is after 11:00 (am); she woke for an hour but has not eaten or drinken a thing at all yet today.Even more worrisome than the food situation is the water. She only drinks when she eats, so you can imagine where that is going. For a few weeks now, she's only been finishing one water bottle (16 oz) of water. Now, it's a good day if she gets in a full 16 oz. Most days she'll drink about 12 oz and on a few bad days she drinken as little as 8 oz. Basically, she's living on about one sandwich and 12 oz. of water a day; for this week, anyway. Each week gets worse and worse. As you can imagine, it's only a matter of time before this takes it's toll and her body begins to shut down, and I think it already is. I believe she is becoming dehydrated already. She has little urine output, her skin is extremely dry, her cheeks are looking sunken in. She is sleeping a lot throughout the day. She will sometimes nap for hours during the days; once she wakes up, she'll pace around for a bit before returning to lay down again. She hasn't been \"talking\" much. Her voice sounds faint and weak when she does attempt to speak, which isn't often. Her interest isn't held on anything for more than a couple of seconds. We are having trouble getting her to take her medicine (swallowing is part of that problem). She has had a couple of falls as well. Last week, my dad went to check in on her in the morning and he found her laying on the bathroom floor, halfway into his closet. The bruising up and down her side confirms our suspicions that she somehow fell and was unable to get up. I know what you all might suggest: hospice. At our last evaluation, they told us there was nothing they can do until she either: no longer walks, develops an infection/pneumonia (has some other medical need), is in pain. Even lack of eating or dehydration won't qualify her. Yet, home health was coming in for a few weeks and has decided to close her case because there is nothing they can do for her; they are in the business of helping people get better (the nurse agreed that hospice is more appropriate for the situation). So right now, Mom is falling between the gaps of our healthcare system. I'm not going down without a fight, though. After talking with several people in my online FTD support group, and upon their insistence, I have put in another call to a different hospice company. Speaking to those who have been through this, or are currently going through the same thing, my initial instinct has been confirmed: that Mom's time left with us is limited. Whether we have weeks or months, I can't say. If she continues her decline at this rate, I would say a few months at best. Needless to say, these are rough waters for us right now :(",

        "content": "Why does obtaining help have to be so difficult? If there's one thing I've learned from this disease, it is that our medical care system is majorly flawed. A couple of years ago, Senate (NOT doctors and medical teams) revised Medicare guidelines for receiving hospice with certain diseases. It used to be that if a person diagnosed with dementia reached the point where they were having trouble swallowing and were losing weight due to that (and decreased eating), they could be labeled as \"failure to thrive\" and receive hospice care. Under new guidelines, Alzheimer's patients can receive hospice under those conditions, but other dementia patients cannot. The problem is, they fail to recognize that dementia is a terminal illness. Anyone who says that it is not is not educated on the disease. When the brain loses function to the point where it cannot tell the body how to swallow or how to process food or how to ward off infections, the consequences are terminal. And such is the way with dementia.Mom is now into the phase of swallowing difficulties and weight loss. From September to April, she has lost approximately 50 pounds and has lost another 10 pounds since April. Her eating habits have continued to change, even within the past few weeks. The amount that she has been eating has continually decreased. She went from eating whole sandwiches to eating only half and over the past few months we've decreased her portion size to 1/4 sandwich sizes because she wasn't finishing much more than that. Even though she was eating frequently, she was only eating 1/4 portions at a time. Yet, she was finishing them. Over the past few weeks, she has decreased her portion size to mere bites of that quarter-sized sandwich. Sometimes, she will point to the bread and pb&j, watch us make it, and then get up and walk away from the table. Other times, she will get her plate from the cupboard, place it on the table (her signal that she is ready for another sandwich) and walk away. It is as if she is simply going through the routine of doing something (making the sandwich) but is forgetting about the actual eating part of it. We've been tracking her intake of food and water. Last summer she was eating, on average, about 5-7 sandwiches a day, plus drinking 2 ensures and at least 32 oz. of water. Now, she is down to only 16-20 oz. of water a day, no ensures and an average of 2-3 sandwiches per day. When I sit back and reflect on that significant change over the past year and witness the weekly and even daily changes, it leads me to believe that she won't last another year. In addition to the drastic decrease in eating and weight, swallowing is becoming more and more of an issue. Most times that she drinks her water, she chokes on it, sometimes to the point where she coughs/spits out everything in her mouth. This puts her at risk for aspiration, which leads to pneumonia. She has been choking on her pills over the past month to the point that we've had to eliminate all unnecessary pills (my dad has been giving her lots of vitamins to keep her healthy, but they are too much trouble now to swallow). With her sleep medication, my dad has been crushing it up and slipping it into her nighttime sandwich. She seems to do better swallowing the sandwich than the pills. The trick now is getting her to finish the sandwich! At the prompting of several people in my online support group, I called and ordered Mom a hospice evaluation (I actually emailed her doctor who sent in the referral). Many people said they were able to receive this service for their loved one by this point and even had them receiving hospice for a year or two! Receiving hospice can be helpful because they pay for all medications, diapers, medical supplies, etc., plus they'd have medical staff come in to check on Mom and help with the bathing. I thought it might be nice to get some extra help and support for my dad. I don't know if it's fortunate or unfortunate that she didn't qualify, but I'm leaning towards unfortunate simply because of the fact that this is a service she would've been able to receive at this point if her diagnosis were Alzheimer's or if they hadn't have changed the guidelines. Basically, the hospice nurse told me at our assessment that they wouldn't be able to step in until Mom becomes non-ambulatory (not walking). The crazy part is that with Mom's specific diagnosis and all other factors (her young age, overall good health), she could very likely be walking up until a few days before she passes away; that's what we're hoping for-we don't want to see her bedridden for months on end. It doesn't matter if she has not eaten or drank in 5 days, they will not step in until she's bedridden. To put this into perspective, I recently had a conversation with another young lady from my support group whose mother passed away last month. Like my mom, her eating decreased more and more each week until one day, she decided she was done eating altogether. From that day, it took 11 days until she passed on, and she was ambulatory until 2 days prior to her passing. The hospice nurse also told me of a family she had assessed in a similar situation where the patient hadn't eaten in 5 days, yet couldn't qualify for hospice yet because she was still ambulatory. So basically, this isn't a service that we will likely receive until we are days away from death.To add more insult to injury, we were told that Medicare wants to see us place her before we can tap into anymore services. See, while we didn't qualify for hospice, we did qualify for a home health nurse to come and assess Mom. Things were looking up when the nurse told us Mom would qualify for in-home help! She originally said that Medicare should provide a caregiver to come 3 days a week for several hours to help with mom, including help with the bathing (which I've been handling for the past 2 years). After trying but failing to not get my hopes up, it turned out that she only qualified for bathing help. Still, we were happy and relieved to get some outside help especially with the summer approaching. Unfortunately, that was also too good to be true. Despite the recommendation from the nurse, Medicare only approved 3 weeks of help with the bathing; I'm not sure what the point of that was! On Friday, the nurse came by to reassess and close out Mom's case. Until she ends up with an infection, in the hospital for some reason, or becomes non-ambulatory, our help is done. UNLESS we decide to place her in a facility; if we do that then we'll get extra help. Apparently the people sitting behind the computers are better equipped to tell us where Mom would be better off and will only offer help if we do it their way. No thank you. It's not anybody's business to tell us how to take care of Mom, least of all those who don't know her!I really don't mind bathing Mom. In fact, I felt a little guilty for those 3 weeks to allow someone else to do it. I feel like it's my job to take care of her. I will admit that it's not always easy or convenient, especially during the summer with the trips we have planned and the time I want to spend with my kids. Through this ordeal, a couple of our caregivers have stepped up and offered to help with the bathing. I still plan to be here when I can to help with that process, but it's nice to have peace of mind in knowing that she'll be taken care of when I'm unable to be here without placing the extra responsibility on my dad-he has enough to worry about! Even though I am extremely frustrated with the lack of care in our system, I feel extremely blessed to have the help that we do have. This isn't going to last forever, so we are all just doing our best to keep Mom happy and healthy for the time she has left with us. ",

        "content": "Last summer, Mom experienced a significant decline and it got me a little bit worried. With every rapid decline, I can't help but to wonder if this is the turn that is going to lead us to that final stage. I could write all the details of what transpired, about our evaluation for hospice and home health care, but it's a long and exhausting story. To sum it all up in a nutshell, some members of my support group suggested that we get her a hospice evaluation claiming that their loved one received hospice much sooner than the phase my mom was in at that time. I kind of got my hopes up; not because I wanted hospice necessarily but because I thought we might actually be able to get some (free) outside help. Well, after the evaluation, it was determined that she was not eligible for hospice yet, even though she did fit some of the criteria. One of the biggest factors, they told me, was weight loss. Significant weight loss indicates that their eating habits are changing; at the end stages of the disease, weight loss will occur, signaling the advancement of the disease. This left me a little confused. For one thing, in everything I've read up about semantic dementia, it says that weight gain is very common in the late stages of the disease. Mom was at her all time heaviest weight, weighing in at 234 pounds. Her average weight (at nearly 5'8\") has always been somewhere between 150-160 lbs. Nevertheless, Mom's eating habits were changing. Some days she'd eat hardly anything at all; other days she would devour 6 or 7 pb&j sandwiches. She was still drinking Ensure though, which is packed full of calories. The hospice nurse recommended that we keep track of her weight and her eating, stating that we could call back for a reevaluation at any time, and especially if we could show changes in her eating patterns and weight loss. So, for the next few months, we kept a log of the times and the quantities of Mom's meals. After a couple months of doing this, we didn't really see much of a decline (especially in weight) so we decided to quit tracking for a while. The last time I weighed her was early fall and not much had changed. BUT, since that time, Mom has quit drinking her Ensures. Dad has left them out for her on the counter and has even tried personally giving them to her, but she won't drink them. She will only drink water from a plastic water bottle and she is now on a 100% pb&j sandwich diet. We generally only make 1/4 of a sandwich for her at a time because so much of the sandwich ended up going to waste. She was taking one or two bites and disposing of the rest and she will not eat leftovers. She has to watch it being made if she's going to eat it!I've noticed her slimming down a little bit over the past few months, so today I decided that I should get her on the scale-just to note the changes. Our caregiver was at the house with me when I showered her so she helped me to get Mom on the scale afterwards. This is no easy feat; Danielle had to pick up her feet and move them onto the scale while I held onto her upper body. I was shocked when I read the scale. In fact, we put her back on two more times just so I could make sure that we read the number right and that it wasn't a mistake. All 3 times, her weight came in right around 183 pounds; 50 pounds less than she weighed in the fall!I am understanding more now about the weight gain/weight loss issue in the last phases of the disease. While those with semantic dementia do tend to gain weight in the later stages of the disease, there is an order to that very final stage that I am finally starting to comprehend. As one enters into the very last stage, there comes a disconnect between body and mind. The body forgets how to eat, how to swallow, how to walk, how to talk, how to hold in human waste. We've seen some of these changes already, but we still have a ways to go. I do think it's time to start tracking her weight again. It's possible we could now get her qualified for hospice, although she could still have a long way to go-there's no way to know for certain how long this phase will last. When she begins to have more trouble with her mobility or complications with infections (pneumonia, UTI's), etc., then I think an evaluation will be in order. Until then, we take it one day at a time.",

        "content": "The other night, as my husband and I were laying in bed, I asked him the question:\"If I end up with dementia, would you take care of me or would you put me in a facility?\" There have been many thoughts and observations that led up to me asking him that question. I've been thinking about my mom a lot, reflecting on the last few years with her, wondering if I may inherit the same fate. Sometimes it feels like she is disappearing from the world; like she's the invisible woman that only I and my close family can see. Every now and then this discussion comes up with my dad as we reflect on those who have and have not been there for us in this journey. The fact about dementia is that it is a very lonely disease. It isn't like other terminal illnesses where you are given an approximate amount of time to tie up your affairs and say your good-byes (and doing so while still in your right mind). Rather, it is unknown and most often very long and drawn out. In the beginning, people are shocked with the diagnosis; they express their love and condolences. But as time wears on, people (understandably) go about their lives and lose interest. The person with dementia is left alone to lose their mind and memories and abilities, day by lonely day. We've been very fortunate to have many family and friends step up to comfort us and help ease to our burden throughout this journey. When Mom was initially diagnosed, there were many who expressed their condolences. We had offers of caregiving help-physically and even financially. But there's a huge difference between talk and action. With as many people who have reached out to us, there are equally as many who have rarely acknowledged the situation. People that my mom have worked with or served with at church; women, who at one time or another my mom has considered to be very close and dear friends, who have never once visited her since her diagnosis or even call to ask how she's doing (the same goes for my dad). There are family members as well who rarely, and some who never, stop by; family members who my mom was very close to, who never pick up the phone to call my dad and ask how she, or even how HE, is doing. Life goes on, and it has to. Everyone has their own struggles to face in life. We understand that, but it's lonely all the same. And I would be lying if I didn't say that it's been hurtful that certain people haven't called or visited over the past 5 years. When we think of the life that Mom led, loving and serving and giving to others, it's sad to feel as if she's been forgotten about that easily; that maybe she didn't mean as much to people as they meant to her.And maybe that's the not the way it really is. Maybe she's not really forgotten. Everyone handles grief differently. Sometimes people don't know what to say or how to react. Many may feel that she doesn't know them anyway, so there is little purpose in visiting (though the visits didn't happen even when she did still remember certain friends and family members). I've been very transparent in sharing our journey so maybe some of these people read my blog, unbeknownst to me, and feel that they already know what's going on. It's a hard situation all the way around. A couple of years ago, I had somebody close to me go over a couple of times to sit with mom. She was friends with mom but I wouldn't say she was super close to her; she was much closer to me. After the second time, she told me, \"I just can't handle seeing your mom like this, so I won't be going over anymore.\" That comment left me feeling so angry and hurt and alone. As hard as she claims it was for her, imagine what the pain must be for my dad to see his sweetheart decline every single day. Imagine how hard it is for my mom's children to watch this disease take her over and transform her into a stranger; how hard it is for us to change roles as we bathe her, change her, care for her; how hard it is for our kids to lose their grandma. I don't think this person intended to hurt my feelings at all. But since that day I can't recall a time she's asked how my mom is doing (though I occasionally volunteer information) and our relationship hasn't been the same. I feel abandoned. The avoidance from friends and family members does cause pain; not just to me, but to my dad as well. I don't write this post to guilt or shame anyone, but rather to help people to understand what every dementia caregiver goes through. There is a common theme in many of my online support groups and that is the feeling of being alone, especially for the main caregiver (most often the spouse; in this situation, my dad). I share this for those who may wonder how you can help ease someone's burden; I give the following suggestions:1. Don't avoid. This is our reality EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Please don't pretend like it's not happening. Don't be afraid to ask how someone is doing-both the person affected and the caregiver. I always feel really grateful when people ask how my dad is doing because they recognize that this is just as much a struggle (if not more) for him than for my mom. You don't have to talk about it every single time you interact with the person, but don't be afraid to check in now and then. You aren't going to offend or upset a caregiver by talking about it!2. Absolutely, do not say or offer anything that you don't mean! We've all heard it: \"Let me know if there's anything I can do to help\" and then when called upon for help, there's no response. I think that's worse than not saying or doing anything at all. It's happened to every caregiver out there. If you are serious about wanting to help, it's more helpful to give specific suggestions of what you can do. Sometimes you may not know what to do, and that's okay! Just don't offer anything if there is no intention of following through.3. Give a phone call or a visit now and then. Even a note or a card in the mail can brighten up a caregiver's day. I know it seems intimidating, but it is appreciated and shows that you really care. I know it means a lot to my dad when people have dropped off treats or sent cards, or even called to check in on how they're both doing. Additionally, keep in mind that people who care for loved ones at home have little social outlets. It's nice, sometimes, to have interaction with other people. It can get really lonely.4. Be mindful that caregiving is a 24/7 job. A lot of times, people will call and ask my dad for help with something, and he's not one to say no. He always makes time to help people. And truthfully I think sometimes he likes it because it gives him another outlet to interact with people. But...people may not give thought that in order for him to go out with them or to go over and help, that means he has to have a caregiver at home that he is paying (or one of us has to come over and sit with mom). It's nice for a caregiver to be able to get out; maybe help provide a way so that they can get out now and then!5. Don't be afraid to recognize special days: birthdays, anniversaries, etc. I have heard from many caregivers who feel sad when people close to them fail to recognize these special days. Perhaps they feel it will upset them to say anything; not bringing it up doesn't make us forget about that day. Be mindful that holidays are going to feel especially sad and lonely, especially while still caregiving as the person is still here to care for. We are grieving for the loss of someone who is still alive and unless you've been through this, it's difficult to describe the many emotions that go with it. Before I end this post, and because I don't want to come off as ungrateful, I want to be sure to recognize that we have been luckier than so many other caregivers out there. Though it hurts with the people who have seemingly deserted us, there are so many who have been and continue to be here for us and for that we are sincerely grateful. Sometimes it's even been strangers, or friends who never even knew my mom before dementia, who have shown us incredible support! Those people have truly lightened the load and I can't tell you how much we love you for being there for us. ",

        "content": "I went to a funeral this morning. In fact, I sang at the funeral with my sister. She was a lovely woman from our church (and the mom to one of my sister's close friends); she passed away from a stroke and she also had cancer.As I sat there, listening to the words of affection that her children spoke, I couldn't help but to think about my mom. And the inevitable fate that awaits us. Since my mom's diagnosis, funerals haven't been the same for me. I look at things differently; I know that death is lurking around the corner. I mourn for the person whose funeral I'm attending, but I also mourn for my mom as I reflect on the emotional loss that I've gone through and anticipate the physical loss I will, in time, endure. I can't help but to think about how my mom's funeral will be. Will there be a lot of people in attendance? Who will come to honor her and to support our family? Who will give the eulogy? Will I have to speak? Will we laugh at the funny memories of Mom or will we be too stricken with grief to smile? What songs will we sing? Will I have to sing? I can't sing at my mother's funeral. Even if it was her request before she was sick. (Sorry Chris-I think you're going solo). I feel the pain that the family members are experiencing at these funerals because I am experiencing that same pain. I have been experiencing this pain over and over for the past 4 years. I have gone through the emotional loss of my mother, but her physical presence won't allow me to move on. In a conversation with my sister the other day, I made a comment that I almost envy those who have lost their parent quickly in a stroke or accident. It isn't dragging on for an indefinite amount of time as they sit back and watch someone they love deteriorate for months or years on end; they aren't constantly wondering, month after month, year after year, is this going to be it? I'm not saying that their loss is any easier. A loss is a loss; it's hard any way it comes. But the heart cannot begin heal while it is still in battle. I feel guilty for having these thoughts. More times than not, I don't know if I am quite ready for that physical loss yet. I don't know if I ever will be. It will be hard and it will be another kind of pain to work through. People will say to enjoy what time we have left; enjoy my moments with her. I do feel comfort in hugging her, stroking her hair, telling her that I love her, but how can I say that I enjoy watching my mom struggle and lose her abilities everyday? There is very little left of my mother. Every now and then I may get a smile out of her, but for the most part, she hardly responds to any of my interactions with her and it is another reminder of everything I've lost. I love my mother. I love her and miss her so much it hurts. I don't know that the pain will ever go away; the battle may end but the scars will remain. But knowing that she is free from pain and from the prison of her body may be the first step to start healing from the nightmare that dementia has brought into my life.",

My brother and his family are coming to stay and help out with Mom while he's gone.Over the past couple of days, in preparation of his arrival, I was reflecting on how much Mom has changed in just 3 months, since Joe last saw her.The most obvious change is that Mom is now in diapers full time; Joe knows about that. I've related the shower struggles and the ever-increasing loss of words and language.But then there are the changes that we don't talk about daily. These are the changes that happen so gradually that it's hard to remember precisely when it started.Mom no longer changes into pajamas at night. In fact, she no longer changes at all. She used to change her clothes if she didn't like my wardrobe selection for her; not anymore. She stays in the same clothes until someone changes her and requires full assistance to get them off and on.Mom only has 3 names left in her vocabulary: Bud, Cassandra and Ellen. I don't know if she remembers who my sister is or any of the grandkids (I think she knows that they belong to me). But the only names and the only people she ever asks for is my dad, my aunt and myself. I think it's a little strange that she still remembers Ellen but not Claudia (her other sister). Claudia comes over weekly to sit with her; Ellen has been over twice over the past 4 years. I assume it has to do with her obsession to walk to Ellen's house. It is the one ritual that she has left and holds onto.Mom doesn't put any make-up on anymore, not even blue eyebrows. She tries sometimes, but it's hard to put on lipstick when the lid is still on the tube. Every once in a while she might get a bottle/container open and she'll end up with eyeshadow or lipstick smeared across her whole face. Toothpaste seems to be her favorite choice of moisturizer. I am with Mom nearly everyday, so the changes aren't as obvious to me. I wonder what it must be like to come and see her after being away for a few months. I am nervous for what lies ahead this week; worried if my brother can handle it all. But also, I'm so relieved that they will be here to help with Mom and to share responsibility with me. At least I know that we are all in this together!Here's hoping that my dad has a restful, stress-free, fun week away! He sure deserves it! If you're reading this, Dad, don't worry-we've got this!

        "content": "They say that all good things must come to an end. This week we officially \"put an end\" to our church volunteers. For the past 3 years, wonderful ladies from our church have been volunteering their time to come over and sit with mom. When mom and dad's ward saw the need, they filled it. Every Sunday, the \"compassionate service leader\" passed around a sign up sheet in the women's auxiliary (called the \"Relief Society\") and women from church signed up for two 4 hour shifts throughout the week. Additionally, if we were ever in a jam, we knew we could count on them to help us out. This was such a huge relief for us, especially in the beginning when were first discovering that Mom needed some extra supervision to keep her safe at home. It was a huge relief and stress off my back (as the caregiver coordinator) to know that there were those two periods of time that I never had to worry about. I knew that they would always pull through for us.About 6 months ago, our wards changed and Mom and Dad were merged into my ward (our church operates in boundaries, much like a school district system). This meant a new coordinator in Relief Society and a different group of women. While the ladies in the other ward had come to love Mom and looked forward to their service with her, this new group wasn't as familiar with our routine and need, so it's been more of a struggle to get people to sign up (or show up when they do sign up). I don't fault or blame anyone, it is what it is and it may be a lot to ask people to sign up for. Dad and I have been discussing the phasing out of volunteers and knew that it wouldn't last forever. As expected with this disease, Mom is advancing in progression. In some ways it is easier (she spends a lot of time in bed) but in some ways it is much harder, especially now that she is diapers full time. We've been very fortunate to have no issues on our volunteers' watch, but I know that we have just been biding our time. It will inevitably happen that Mom has a big mess while a volunteer is with her, and I wouldn't expect them to have to clean up that mess. Taking all of these factors into account, we have officially called off our church volunteers. It is bittersweet. I have come to love many of these women who have so selflessly and compassionately loved and served my family. I know that many of them have come to love and care for my mom as well (and they are certainly welcome to come visit!) On behalf of my family, I want to give our sincere gratitude and thanks to all of the women over the past few years who have stepped up and helped to ease our burden. We could not have done this without you! We love you and will forever remember the great service you gave to us in our time of need. I don't know that I can ever repay each individual back, but I hope to repay it back by giving others service in their time of need. Love, service and compassion is what makes the world go round!",

I am proactive with my work in the foundation, which gives me a focus and a purpose. I am patient with my mom and I get the job done without breaking. I try to focus on all of the good things I have going on in my life, things that bring me joy: my beautiful kids, my incredible husband, my amazing and supportive friends, my home-based sewing business (which doubles as my therapy time!).

I don't think there's any way to describe it to a person who has never experienced it. You grieve for the loss of the person that was once there, while still holding on to the physical being that remains. The grief is relentless and suffocating at times. I feel on edge; any unpleasant thing can bring me to tears. I am a ticking time bomb; one wrong move can set me off.It's a continual rollercoaster of emotions; one day I'm up, the next I'm down.Over the weekend, we received some unpleasant news that kind of sent me into a downward spiral. It would have been upsetting even if my life weren't plagued by dementia, but that dark, hovering raincloud (called dementia) met with this other passing, dark cloud and together they brewed a nasty storm. I stewed about this particular situation for days and I was left feeling, hurt, sad, and angry. Very angry. I'm not even saying my anger is justified, but when you're already slightly unbalanced it's as if the senses are heightened and what might start out as disappointment or sadness can easily fester into some other (stronger) emotion. For me, it was a lot of anger. Anger at the situation but probably mostly triggered by this disease. I'm angry that dementia has made me such a basket case. I'm angry for the strain it has put on some of my relationships, and at the people who I feel have let me down over the years. And most of all I am ANGRY that this disease struck my mom. I am angry for her, that she has been robbed of what is supposed to be the best years of her life. I am angry that my dad is losing the love of his life, for the pain and the helplessness he feels at watching her slowly fade away each and every day; for the helplessness I feel for not being able to fix it and make it better. I am angry that I've lost my mother, who was so much more than my mom; she was also my friend, my confidant and therapist, the one person that I could talk to without fear of judgment, who could give me advice or help me navigate my way through a problem, the one person who loved me and thought the world of me. I am angry that my children have lost their grandma and will never experience what I had growing up: the grandma to spend the night with, to bake cookies with, to have at every one of their music recitals or sports events or any important life event, to be their biggest cheerleader and to be their refuge from their \"mean\" parents. This is the kind of grandma I had and this is the kind of grandma that my mom wanted to be. And I'm ANGRY that was all taken away from us. I don't usually post negativity on my blog; I like to keep it away and I don't want to sound like a whiny, sniveling baby. I'm not the first person to lose their mom at a young age and I'm certainly not the last. At the same time, I think it's only fair to my readers to be real. Somebody out there might be reading this while riding their own rollercoaster of emotions and I think it's important for them to know that they aren't alone in this. Because so often with this disease, we feel alone. I feel alone. You aren't crazy. Or maybe you are. But if you are, I'm right there with you!",

        "content": "Incontinence. I hate that word.I've known from the beginning that incontinence is part of the disease. But four years ago, it was hard to imagine that it could actually happen to my mom. I thought maybe it would skip her, or only happen in the very last weeks of her life. In fact, I prayed that when the incontinent phase did hit full swing that the end would come quick. Nobody should have to suffer like that. My dad was optimistic that maybe this phase would pass over her altogether.Mom's incontinence started in October, but it was sporadic. She might go a few weeks without a single accident and then have accidents two or three days in a row. It's easy to say to put a diaper on her, but much harder to do. Over the past couple of months, there have been a few times that we have had to put diapers on her because on that given day she was continually wetting herself. Once she was dry for a day or two, dad would put her back in regular underwear to preserve whatever amount of dignity was left, for as long as possible.Unfortunately, over the past two week, the incontinence has been an everyday occurrence which has resulted in Mom's use of diapers on a daily basis. It breaks my heart, yet I've known it was coming. I've expected it. I think up until a couple of weeks ago, my dad was still hoping we could bypass the constant use of diapers. Putting the diapers on mom has eliminated a lot of mess and stress of cleaning up some pretty messy accidents, but there are downsides to diapers, aside from the obvious (losing one's dignity). Today, when I bathed mom, I discovered red bumps on her bottom. I couldn't but let out a little cry when I saw them.\"Oh mom, you poor thing,\" I said, as she stepped into the shower. My maternal instincts set in and I felt pained and saddened when I saw her bottom. Poor dear must be miserable! Even though we try to stay on top of things and change her when she's wet, she's still developed a rash. I didn't have any desitin on hand to treat it (I'll be making a run to the pharmacy here in a bit!), but my dad did have cornstarch in his cupboard. Linda, our caregiver, suggested we try it and I remembered how I used to use cornstarch for my babies whenever they had a bad diaper rash. After I cleaned her up, I put some cornstarch in the diaper. Tonight my dad will try desitin (or whatever the pharmacist might recommend!!) Hopefully with persistent changing and cleansing, it'll clear up quickly.But, I'm sure this is just the beginning. I've read the horror stories of others who have been there already: diaper rashes, bed sores, frequent UTI's...I suppose it's just the next step in the disease. But it sucks all the same :/",

        "content": "While raising my children, there have been certain milestones that I've waited for them to reach as they've grown. The earliest milestones that I can remember include sitting up on their own, first words, crawling, walking, eating solid foods. As they've grown, they've learned so much within those first few years of life: developing fine and gross motor skills, learning how to socialize with their peers, how to tie their shoes, and perhaps one of my favorites: how to go potty on their own. The list of accomplishments goes on and on. With each milestone, I feel a sense a pride at the tasks my child has accomplished and I marvel in the wonder of them learning and developing into little people.With dementia, these same sorts of \"milestones\" exist, only they are not so pleasing and exciting. Rather, they are quite the opposite. Each \"milestone\" brings us closer and closer to the end. Let me break down the \"milestones\" I am referring to.I learned early on in the disease what we would be dealing with as mom's disease progressed. It was hard to share this information with my family and I think there was even a bit of denial that it would really come down to this, and so I shouldered the burden of knowledge and waited for these things to come to pass. I've said before that dementia is, in a sense, like growing backwards. While children grow and learn new things with each year of life, my mom forgets these things with each year (or even more rapidly than that). Dementia takes you from being an independent, intelligent adult to eventually becoming like a child again, fully dependent and not knowing how to care for oneself any longer. I think of it in phases: the childhood phase, then the preschool phase, then down to toddler and finally infancy. With each of these phases, mom seems to be on the developmental level of each of these age brackets as she forgets what she knew just months before. First, she was losing her social inhibition (this tends to be one of the later skills that children master). Slowly, she has been losing the ability of doing her hair and make up until finally, it looks as if a toddler has gotten into mother's make up box and smeared color all over her face. She's gone from dressing herself to being super obsessive about matching (not being able to distinguish between matching and coordinating), dressing herself with clothes inside out and backwards to now needing assistance at times to get her clothes on and off. Her fine motor skills have gone by the wayside; it started with misspelling, partial sentences and sloppy writing. I haven't seen her read or write in close to a couple years now. Her speech is very minimal; most words are gibberish and difficult to understand; comprehension is gone.The later phases of the disease look a lot like infancy. A person affected by dementia will eventually start losing balance and the ability to walk. Chewing and swallowing become difficult and choking becomes a real concern. As a result, many people end up with a liquid diet or pureed foods, much like baby food. Incontinence sets in which results, most often, in adult diapers. Speech regresses until there are no words left to speak. They spend a lot of time sleeping, much like a newborn Indeed, it is like caring for a newborn child in an adult's body until finally, their body completely shuts down.As you can imagine, it's been difficult to come to terms with all of this and I know my dad has remained the forever optimist, thinking maybe she won't get to those phases. If she is spared from going through the complete course of the disease, it would only be because grace steps in and takes her from something else instead (a heart attack, stroke, etc). I can't tell you how long my mom has left. That question goes through our brains everyday. I try to make the most of the time I do have with her because truly, we don't know how long until the disease rips away the rest of what is left. And truthfully, I pray that when/if it gets to the point where she is completely bedridden, that it goes faster rather than slower. At any rate, what I can tell you right now is my observations of what has been happening as of late.For a while now, it seems like mom simply inhales her sandwiches and doesn't take the time to chew. The other day I stopped to observe her while she ate her sandwich and I've noticed that she isn't really biting down when she chews. She moves her jaw but what she does resembles more of \"gumming\" her food, like you'd see in a toddler. I guess in this way it's somewhat of a blessing that all she'll eat is pb&j sandwiches because at least it's a soft food and harder to choke on than say, a steak. Even still, she eats quickly, swallowing large bits of sandwich that aren't chewed (this evidence was found in her vomit a few weeks ago) which results in coughing while she eats. She often ends up with big hiccups by the end of her meal. We won't talk about the mess that is made while she eats; if you've had a toddler, you can imagine.We've also noticed several occasions where she has ensure spilled all down the front of her shirt. She seems to be having problems drinking out of the bottle. She will not drink out of cups; I'm not sure how that would go over if we tried. She only drinks out of water bottles and ensure bottles and like I said, it's getting harder for her to make it all in her mouth.We've been lucky that she's had no falls. But I can tell that her balance and coordination is worsening. When I help her to get her legs into her pants, she has to hold onto the wall of the bathroom to steady herself and prevent from falling over. She can't raise her legs very high, so I bunch up the legs of the pants and bring them as far down to meet her foot as possible. She has been struggling to get her socks on as well. I usually bunch them up and help her get them on over her heel. If I don't do this, she oftentimes can't get the sock on over her heel and she ends up with the sock hanging halfway off her foot and bunching up inside her shoe. And one of the hardest things of all: incontinence. This has been hard to talk about because it's like stripping away the last of her pride. Of course, we know it's not her fault; it is the disease. Nevertheless, it breaks my heart that she is struggling with getting to the bathroom in time; most times she doesn't seem to even notice that she's had an accident. This issue began six months ago and has been progressing since then. In times where she isn't feeling good (if she has a cold or something) it gets worse during that time period. In fact, a couple of weeks ago, mom had a rough week. The worst of it was on a Monday, when I was sitting with her. She had a little bit of a cough and she had had several accidents between that Friday before and the Monday that I was there. By Monday afternoon, she'd had an accident within an hour of her last accident and I was down to one dry pair of pants for her. I knew what I should do, but it was really difficult in doing it. My dad hasn't wanted to put my mom in diapers. He wants her to be as independent as possible and I think there's a fear that once we put her in them, she'll become dependent and not use the toilet anymore. I was really worried that he would be upset with my decision, but not knowing what else to do, I changed my mom into an adult diaper (I had brought over a pack months ago, just in case). I can't describe to you how difficult it was for me to put that on her or to step back and look at my mom wearing it; she was resembling a grown toddler in every sense now. My heart broke for her, but it was necessary.Fortunately, the accidents lessened up by the end of that week so we went back to underwear and incontinence pads, but it is a battle that I'm afraid is not going away. Additionally, we have struggled with her flushing things down the toilet (washcloths, pads, etc) and using towels in place of toilet paper...that is her new norm. It's unpleasant and smelly but at least she is using something. I've heard horror stories from other people.I fear that it's truly the beginning of the end. What I have described is typically what you see in the later phases of the disease, though there's no real guess as to how long the later phases can go on. I think (from what I've read and heard from others' experiences) this phase can last a few years. I speculate that we may have a couple years left at most. But...she could surprise us all.",

        "content": "I try to keep pretty positive on my posts, but sometimes this disease is so overwhelming. For the past week I've been in a funk again; it's such a rollercoaster ride. Part of my down mood comes from watching my mom's decline; it seems like every week there is something new that comes up in the progression of her disease. I've also taken on a little bit of freelance work, writing for a website that talks about dementia and caregiving. I just turned in my first assignment which took me nearly a week to gather my thoughts together for and write. While I am thankful for the opportunity to educate others, and also to be able to write down my thoughts and experiences throughout all of this, it can be difficult at times. Especially as I look back and reflect on all that has transpired over the past several years; it brings up many emotions-some good, and some not-so-good.Even though I like to stay positive, I think it's important to share all sides of this journey, especially for readers who are going through this same thing. They need to know that they are not alone and that it's normal to feel down and discouraged at times. We are mourning the loss of someone we love who is still living, and that's a difficult thing to process.One of mom's latest \"things\" that she is doing is crying. They aren't full on tears, but very often she will ramble about something and then her voice gets a little deep and crackly, her eyes gloss up and her lips quiver downward. She's done this a few times over the past year or so, but it is becoming very frequent now. I would say that at least once throughout each visit/encounter with mom, I witness one of these crying episodes. It breaks my heart. I want to break down and cry with her-and nearly did the first time it started happening consistently.I was helping her blow dry her hair a couple of weeks ago when mom started mumbling something. I couldn't make out what she was trying to say but suddenly, out of nowhere, her eyes welled up, lips turned downward into a frown and her voice was cracking. There were tears in the corner of her eyes and I was a little caught off guard.\"What's wrong mom? What's the matter?\" I asked her.Of course she didn't respond to my questioning, but she continued crying about something. I turned off the blow dryer, looked into her eyes and patted her back, reassuring her that \"it's okay\". I could've cried myself, although I'm not much of a crier. My heart hurts every time she does this. Much of the time I don't understand what she's saying and I have no idea what she is thinking that is making her feel emotional. Is she scared? Is she confused at what is happening to her? Is she sad? I feel so helpless. I wish I could give her the comfort that she always gave to me.My sister posted a little sentiment today about our experience over the weekend. I was going to blog about it, but then she wrote it, so I'm just going to paste here what she wrote:\"Sunday afternoon, my sister Cassandra walked with my mom over to my house. As soon as she walked in, my mom began asking, \"Jeremy, Dominic, Raelynn?\" I tried to explain that the kids were not there, but she continued to wander the first floor of the house looking for them. Finally, she stopped in the kitchen and her eyes welled up with tears. In the entirety of my mom's illness, I have never seen this, as some of her earliest symptoms were apathy and no show of emotion. My sister and I rubbed her back and assured her the kids would be back shortly (I then called my dad, who was just getting to his house with my kids after church, to bring the kids over). My mom sat on the stairs in the meantime, and when she saw one of my cats, she pointed and asked, \"What's that? What's that thing?\" My sister told my mom that she used to like cats and then took my mom's hand and stroked the cat. When the kids walked in a couple of minutes later and came and hugged my mom, her eyes again welled with tears as she again asked, \"Jeremy, Dominic, Raelynn?\" She visited for about 5-10 minutes before she was ready to go home.I have been thinking about my mom a lot over the last couple of weeks, particularly how proud she would be of all of her grandchildren. When I became pregnant with Jeremy at 18 years old, it was not an ideal situation and my mom was naturally worried; however, once he was born, he was my mom's pride and joy. She loved being surrounded by her grandchildren; she loved babysitting, teaching, loving, and being a part of their activities. She shows little interest now; she usually pats them on the head and smiles and then continues whatever she is doing. No doubt that if she was herself, she would be the world's best grandma.\"This disease is hard and the hardest parts are yet to come. ",

        "content": "One of the things I like about writing this blog is making connections with other people who are traveling this road. I receive emails often and in a way it's comforting to know that I'm not alone.About a year ago, a reader emailed me and entitled her email \"Your mom is just like mine!\" It turns out that her mom was also diagnosed with FTD, the semantic variant. Over our correspondences, we found so many striking similarities of our moms at that time. We've become friends on facebook and although we don't talk often, I often think about her and her mom (as I do with all of the people I've emailed with!) For some reason, I was just thinking of her the other day, in fact, and thought about how I should send her an email to check in and see how her mom was doing. Today, however, my question was answered when I saw her post on facebook that her mom had passed away over the weekend.I feel an incredible sadness for what this family is going through. I have been feeling a bit melancholy today as this reminds me of what the future holds for my mom and my family. The reality is that there are no survivors of dementia. It is a disease that ravages a person day by day, inch by inch. I don't know how much time we have left with my mom. Some days it feels like she can live another 10 years like this because physically, she is in good health. But then I am reminded that this is a disease of the brain; when the brain dies, eventually the body will catch up. Even though I know what the future holds, I ask myself, am I ready for that? I don't know how to answer. On one hand, I believe in a life after this one, where my mom will be free of her disabilities and pain, a place where we will all be together again. Other days, I don't feel like I am ready to give her that physical good-bye. Dementia is an emotional roller coaster. There are constantly ups and downs-or should I say downs and even more downs. There isn't really anything \"up\" about it but I try to be positive in this journey and enjoy the time that I do have left with my mom. Today, I feel sad. I hold back my tears for this friend and her family and for the fate that awaits my own family. I want to wrap my arms around my mom and hug her tight (even though she'll push me away!) because I'll never know when one day might be the last.",

        "content": "I am not my mom's favorite person these days.Not to say that I ever was. But I think it's safe to say that she liked me pretty well in the past :) One of the things that we knew would become an issue with this disease is hygiene. This was one of mom's strong points in the earlier stages. In fact, even when mom failed her tests at UCLA, the nurse found the positive for us by saying,\"At least she still takes good care of herself and doesn't need help in the area of hygiene.\"At the time, I couldn't even imagine mom needing assistance with her grooming because of her rigid routine (which included showering and toileting-at very specific times) and her obsession with her appearance. Sadly, mom has been losing these abilities little by little over the past several months. I've written a few posts about her diminishing hair and make up skills and the irregular showering. Unfortunately, over the matter of a few months, it has gotten to the point where mom will go all week without showering, until she is forced to get in. Her resistance usually accompanies complaints that she doesn't have enough make-up or a blow dryer (despite the fact that she has both). She doesn't want to mess it all up since she feels she doesn't have what she needs to make herself presentable after the shower.My dad never complains and rarely asks for help with anything other than supervising mom. He leaves the tougher jobs, like grooming, for himself. After a hard day at a labor intensive job, I know the last thing he wants to deal with is having to forcefully get my mom into the shower. Not to mention that by showering her at night often disorients her into thinking it's morning time (which means dad gets little sleep at night!) He is out the door early in the morning, oftentimes before mom is even awake, so showering her in the morning is tough as well. I decided to make it part of my job and (hopefully) take some of the weight off of dad's back. Over the past couple of weeks, we've implemented a new showering routine for mom. Every other day, mom gets her shower, whether she likes it or not (I would say not). Of course it isn't as easy as simply telling her to get in the shower. It was tricky at first, but I've pretty much got it down now. Sad to say, but we actually have to remove her clothing from her (she won't do it herself), much like with a little child, to cue her that it's shower time. Some days she will plop her body down on the bed and I have to pull her pants off while lifting her body (that's a good work out!) Other times I can get her into the bathroom first and remove her clothes there. Once I manage to get her clothing off, she usually protests and sits herself firmly down on the toilet, waiting for me to go away. I pretend to leave and crack the door shut; she stands back up, poking her head out the bathroom door to see if I'm gone, and that is when I take my opportunity to guide her into the shower, disallowing her to sit down again (sometimes that results in a naked bear hug as I move her into the shower!) The other day, no sooner did I start taking off mom's shirt than she lamented,\"I don't want you here, I wish you weren't here!\"Later that day, while visiting her sister, she mumbled complaints to Ellen about how I shouldn't \"see her naked or plain Jane.\" I know I am not her favorite person these days but that's okay. It doesn't hurt my feelings. I know that the \"real\" mom, lost deep inside her somewhere, appreciates all that we do as a family to care for her and keep her as comfortable as possible in her own home. I'm not writing this post for sympathy or for praise. As much as I hate what this disease has done, I am happy to help my mom. I do not resent that [help] in the least. Neither am I doing anything that millions of other unpaid, family caregivers do day in and day out. Unfortunately, this is a part of life (I would've been happier to deal with it much later in life!) and there are many other families who suffer far worse with their loved ones. Lucky for us, mom doesn't have many of the aggression and behavior issues that many people with dementia suffer from. I don't know if it will come later on, but I'll be happy if we skip that part! The only thing I do regret is making mom feel uncomfortable. While I know that it's become necessary to assist with her bathing, I know she doesn't like me seeing her in the nude. I feel bad about it and try to look away when I can but there's really no way around it. So it goes with dementia. ",

        "content": "I've been fighting myself all day about writing this post. It's hard to share some things that are so personal and private and I don't want to shame my dad in any way (although he has nothing to be ashamed about). Maybe I shouldn't write anything, but then I wouldn't be sharing the whole journey: the not-so-good, the bad and the ugly. Today was an ugly. It was the kind of day any caregiver would dread and I was fuming for the better part of the day.It started when I stopped by my dad's to drop something off for my Aunt, who watches my mom on Friday mornings. My dad was supposed to be gone, but his truck was parked almost midway down the driveway with his front end hanging a couple feet into the street, which I thought was odd. I walked up to the porch and noticed a white car parked across the street that I didn't recognize. As the kids and I reached the doorstep, I pulled my house keys out and went to unlock the deadbolt only to discover that the screen door (which is always kept locked to prevent mom from running out) was not only unlocked, but cracked open. Strange, I thought. In a quick instant I wondered if something was going on and when I opened the door I walked in to find two women, standing in the living room and talking to my dad, who was sitting on the couch. One of the women was holding a clipboard and after only a few seconds of listening to the conversation, I knew they were talking about my mom.I looked over to my Aunt Claudia, who was also sitting on the couch, and gave her a questioning look, wondering what this was all about. She mouthed the words \"social workers\" to me. Weird, I thought, crinkling my nose. I left the room, while they continued talking, to check on my mom in her bedroom. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary in there. When I returned to the living room, the social workers were finishing up their visit and said good-bye to my dad. As soon as they left, I turned to my dad.\"What was that all about?\" I asked him.\"Well, it seems somebody called Adult Protective Services on me,\" he said, matter-of-factly.My jaw dropped and I couldn't even find words to respond. It made no sense. Who would do such a thing? Why would someone call and cause trouble for my dad? And most of all, what could they possibly have reported??When I finally found my voice to ask my dad these questions, he replied that the social workers were not allowed to tell who made the call or why. All they could tell him was that *someone* called because they were \"concerned\" about his wife. The social workers checked in on my mom and talked to my dad, who had nothing to hide. He answered each question honestly and opened up about some of the struggles we've faced. They talked to him about the option of putting my mom in a facility; my dad told them it was out of the question. In the end, I think they were satisfied with all of my dad's answers and could see that he is doing his best to take care of his wife; they didn't say anything about a follow up but I don't really know what the procedure for that sort of thing is (if they would tell him or not) but I fear this has opened a door to social workers now breathing down our necks and watching our every move. Let me just tell you how I felt when he shared this information with me. You know what they say about Mother Bear Claws? It was something similar to that. How dare somebody call Adult Protective Services on my dad!! My dad loves my mom more than we even know. I can see it in his everyday actions for her; working hard to find a way to keep her at home where she is comfortable, keeping her happy with her pb&j sandwiches and \"slim fast\" and Bath & Body Works; buying her endless supplies of make-up and following after her on her walks; disabling hot wires of her blow dryer just so that he doesn't have to take the blow dryer away from her completely (she loves that blow dryer!); switching out her non fat milk to almond milk in an effort to get her something more nutritious and easier on her stomach (talk about a pain in the neck!)...these are just a few of the great lengths that my dad goes to for my mom to see that she is safe and happy. If my dad didn't love and care about my mom so dang much, he would've put her in a home a long time ago. None of us are perfect and this is a hard, untraveled road that we find ourselves going down. Mistakes may be made, but make no mistake about her well-being; mom is getting the best care possible at this time. At the end of the day, people may disagree with the way we deal with things, but it is nobody's business!!I've spent most of the day stewing over this issue. I can't figure out who would do such a thing. I would hate to think it could be any of our caregivers or family members. Most of the immediate neighbors know my parents. If there was any concern, why would somebody think they need to address it with Adult Protective Services? I've tried to think that maybe it really was out of concern for my mom but let's face it, calling APS is a chicken move! If there's any concern, they could have talked to my dad. Instead, this person has added even more stress into my dad's life because now, whether he realizes it or not, APS is going to be checking in on him, watching for any and every little mistake; this is what worries me the most. Until someone has had to care for their loved one with dementia, they don't understand it-not social workers, not therapists, not doctors. The last thing a caregiver needs is someone breathing down their neck and feeling that they aren't doing a good enough job.So, for the person who called APS and to everyone else reading this post, let me say it loud and clear: MY DAD IS DOING A GREAT JOB CARING FOR MY MOM!! I admire him greatly and have learned many lessons of love from him. There's nowhere else that my mom could be where she would be better taken care of or loved more than with my dad. So...if anyone has a problem, either brave up and bring your concerns to my dad, or go away! ",

He was gone for 8 days and 7 nights. It was a very much needed break for him and I'm really glad he got to go. I know he worries leaving mom behind, but he knows that he can count on us to help him out. I've watched mom plenty of times in the past when dad has gone out of town. We have the usual routine of caregivers during the day and between my sister, her husband, my husband and myself, we rotate turns spending the night. I'm finding it a bit more difficult as her disease progresses. She is to the point now where she needs some help getting into the shower, so that was one of our jobs while dad was out-making sure she showers. It's not an easy thing to have to disrobe your parent and force them into a shower. The first time I had to do that, I really felt like I was violating her in some way. The first time is the hardest. After that, you learn what is necessary to do and you just learn to it. It's probably more difficult emotionally than anything else.It's hard to put into words all the emotions that I felt during this week of caring for mom, but I was glad that I was able to come over and help my mom (and dad). While it's been difficult to have to take on a parent role with my mom, there were some tender moments as well. One night, mom was laying in her bed and I went to lay down beside her, just to keep her company (and maybe for my own comfort as well). She was mumbling that her face hurt. She hasn't been washing it well and I discovered that she is using her body wash as a facial moisturizer; needless to say her skin is dry and peeling. I knew she would fight me, but I decided to try and wipe her face with a cleansing cloth. At first, she protested and pulled her sheet over her head and began laughing hysterically, which made me start laughing as well. Eventually, she let me finish wiping her face as the dead skin wiped off in the cloth. I brought over her face moisturizer and began rubbing it into circles on her face. She initially started swatting my hand away, but she finally calmed down. She laid her head back and closed her eyes as I rubbed the moisturizer into her thirsty skin. For a quick minute, I thought she might have even enjoyed the nurturing. There were definitely ups and downs of the week. I felt a huge weight of responsibility on my shoulders while my dad was gone. Even though I had help from other people, ultimately I felt the most responsibility for her. I was in charge of coordinating the caregiving schedule so I had to worry if people would show up or not and fill in when people cancelled at the last minute (which I usually do every week anyway, but not 24/7). It's no different than being a parent; your children are on the forefront of your mind constantly, and that's how it was with my mom. But with the responsibility of caring for someone also comes a growing love for that person. My heart swells with love for my mom. It is so hard to balance my family and kids and all of my other life responsibilities and I'm not perfect. By Thursday night, I admit I did have a little bit of a meltdown and was feeling discouraged. But I think that comes with the territory of caregiving. Caregiving is hard and it takes a lot out of you, and there are times that you have those meltdowns, but it doesn't change your love for the person. It made me realize and appreciate more of the weight that my dad carries around with him every day. I am really glad that he was able to have such a fun week with his family; it is well deserved.I feel impressed to say one more thing; someone made a comment to me that I want to address. It was insinuated that I write about things to put it out there and show off to everyone what I do for my mom. That insinuation really hurt my feelings. It's often difficult to write the things that I do and I hesitate sometimes to do it. And I've always had the personality that worries what people will think (though I'm learning, with age and experience, to get over that). I write for a few different reasons: to educate about the disease, to help others in their journey and because writing is therapeutic for me. People leave me very kind comments which I appreciate, but it sometimes makes me uncomfortable because I really don't feel like there's anything extra special about what I'm doing. I think it is what anyone would do. I do not write to seek praise or to get a pat on the back, simply to share our journey with others.",

        "content": "One of the hardest things about dealing with this disease is coming to terms with the role reversal which it brings. As my mom's abilities become less and less, we have to step in to do more and more for her. With every forced clothing change or face and hand wash after lunch or assistance in the bathroom, I feel like I am ripping her dignity away from her; especially when she tells me,\"I'm your mom, you should support me.\" Deep down I know that I am doing the right thing and taking care of her the best that I can. Still, I feel as if I am disrespecting- and in some instances violating-my mom. I can only imagine how my dad must feel.Today was probably the toughest in this aspect that I've faced in a while. It wasn't just one thing that I had to play mom for today. It was several. It started when I first arrived to her house. Dad had warned me that mom's make-up has gotten dramatically worse over the past few days. I didn't think that was possible but sure enough, mom had globs of make up on her face when I walked in her room. I can assume that she poured a bottle of foundation in her hands and then smeared it all on her face, without rubbing any of it in. It was wet and runny and gloppy. I got some toilet paper and wiped her face in sections, with her swatting my hand away in between each section. I had to wait until she was distracted with brushing her hair to quickly rub some more of the residue off her face. Mom's been so antsy lately to get out of the house. Unfortunately, she doesn't get out often because she is difficult for a lot of her caregivers to manage. I don't mind taking her out; I usually feel like I can handle it (although it's getting harder and harder when I have my 4 year old sidekick in tow). I knew mom wanted to go to her sister's, so I told her that I would take her. She really wanted to get exercise and I kept repeating to her that she could walk up to the top of the street and then get in my car. The instant that front door was unlocked, mom plowed through the door and sprinted up the street. I quickly got my son and myself in the car and followed after her (thankfully she used the sidewalk this time). By the time she got to the top of the street, her sprint had turned into a shuffle and she was panting quite hard. I urged her to get in the car and she did.When she was ready to leave her sister's house, she was insistent again on walking. My Aunt lives on a busy street and I am not comfortable with mom walking to the end of the street alone as she tends to walk in the middle of the street now. My Uncle helped me block the door so that I could get a good hold on her arm before she darted out the door. I practically had to drag my mom to the door (she was trying to drag me to the street) and my Uncle and I finally got her in the front seat, buckling her seat and closing the door. But mom is mischevious. As soon as I began walking around the car to get to my side of the car, she unbuckled her seat and darted out the door. My Uncle caught her and I decided it would be safer to put her in the back seat with the child lock on. I tried to get her seatbelt on, but she kept taking it off. Unfortunately, we drove the mile home without her seatbelt fastened, but the child locks prevented her from getting out (she reminded me, also, to lock the windows!!) I forgot to mention that in the process of getting her into the car, she spilled her opened can of root beer (which she keeps in her purse) ALL over my car. Ugh.Once we were at home and mom went back to her room, I tried to get her to change her pants. She had root beer and jelly all over pants but of course didn't understand the need to change clothes. I knew she'd make a big mess everywhere she went, and especially on her bed, with her pants in that condition so I tried to take control of the situation and change her pants. That meant pulling down her pants and physically fighting her to get them off. This is where I feel as if I'm violating my mom. Sometimes I just don't know if I'm doing the right thing when I have to be forceful with her, especially when it violates her privacy. As I was trying to change her, I made a strange discovery. Mom had on no underwear beneath her pants. I'm not sure how she missed that step in getting dressed, but poor mom forgot to put them on (I have no idea if this is a first or not). Furthermore, I discovered that both her undershirt and her bra were on backwards. I have to admit I chuckled a little bit at that one; sometimes I don't know whether to laugh or cry so to keep my sanity I try to find the humor. After being pushed and kicked at, I lost the battle with changing mom's clothes. She's a lot bigger than me nowadays and while I am pretty good at restraining her from running into the street, I am no match against her at clothes changing time. Thankfully, my dad came home around noon in between appointments and was able to change her. It really amazes me how he is able to just get in and get the job done.I'm not sharing any of this to embarrass my dear mom; it's not really her I'm writing about. It is the disease. Still, I debated if I should post about this or not (particularly the underwear issue); there are a lot of things that I opt not to write about because it feels too personal. I do feel a little bit of guilt for exposing some other personal situations. But I want people to understand the real challenges of this disease. Dementia isn't only losing memories; it's losing all abilities. It's so much worse than portrayed in movies like \"The Notebook\". It's an ugly, horrible disease that rips away all dignity. I have readers who have written to me and shared that my blog has helped them to know what to expect from their loved one who is stage(s) behind my mom; I write this for them as well. It's not easy to see what lies ahead, but knowledge is power and preparations (mentally and physically) help a lot in the management of disease. And I suppose I also needed to share some of my thoughts for my own therapy. I try to be optimistic and find humor when I can. Overall I'd like to think I'm pretty good at keeping positive and being strong. But today left me feeling really down for some reason and I felt like I needed to write to get some of these feelings off my chest. There are days when I feel like I'm not ready to lose my mom (physically) quite yet, and other days where I wish that she could leave this earth before the rest of her dignity is completely gone. I hate what this disease has done to her. Dementia is a beast.",

        "content": "Sometimes, a day spent with mom can be quiet and a little boring. She rarely comes out to the living room or kitchen anymore, unless it is to retrieve food or medicine. She keeps herself tucked away in her room or in the computer room. On those days we sometimes wonder, does she really need someone here at every hour of the day?And then we have a day like today. And we are reminded with certainty that mom should not be left alone. To make a long story short, we had nobody to watch mom this morning. I found out yesterday that her usual Friday morning caregiver had a last minute doctor's appointment that she had to attend. Everyone I called had appointments and I had a dentist appointment this morning as well. And you know how those go...if you don't give a 24 hour cancellation notice, they charge you for the missed appointment. Mom had told me yesterday afternoon that she didn't want anyone over this morning because she had to wash her hair and take a shower. So after a few fruitless phone calls and talking with my dad, we (apprehensively) figured she would be okay until I was done with my dentist appointment, at which point I would come by and stay with her.I breathed a sigh of relief as I walked up to mom's front door after my appointment this morning; both doors were closed and locked. The last time mom had made an escape, she left the door cracked open. I assumed she was home. I let myself in the house, locked the door behind me, set down my things, and got my son settled in. Then I made my way to the back of the house to see what mom was up to. The door to the computer room was shut and it was about that time that she would normally be playing her games. I turned on the knob, expecting it to be locked (as usual) but to my surprise it immediately opened. Mom's desk chair was empty. That grabbed my attention right away and as I glanced further down the hall, my heart skipped a beat; mom's bedroom door was wide open (she never leaves her door open when she's in there). I rushed to her room and as expected, her bed was empty. I looked in her usual hiding places-the closet, bathroom, alongside her bed.\"Mom? Mom, where are you?!\" I called, trying not to panic.When I searched all the rooms in the house and couldn't find my mom, I knew well enough that she had gotten out. I grabbed my purse and my keys and my son (who was protesting that he hadn't gotten his peanut butter and jelly sandwich yet) and hurried out the front door. I figured there were only a few places she would have gone: the Avon lady's house (which I would've likely seen her if that was the case, as the Avon lady is at her other job right now and mom would have been walking back home), the grocery store or my Aunt's house. Being that it is Friday, I turned on the street leading to my Aunt's house.I made it almost the entire way to my Aunt's house when I finally spotted my mom at the top of the road, wearing her thick, fleece blue jacket and jeans and carrying one purse on each shoulder (one is for her lunch). [The advantage to mom wearing the same clothes everyday is that she's easy to find or describe in a situation like this!] She was walking my direction at the top of the street but not in her usual, fast paced sprint. Instead, her walk looked almost shuffled and she moved slowly, looking around as though she was confused. When I pulled up closer, I saw that her face was bright red and her make-up was dripping with the sweat on her skin. I pulled over to the side of the road, put the car park and put on my hazard lights and called to her,\"Mom, mom! It's me, Cassandra. Your daughter.\"She looked confused.\"Ellen, Ellen? I'm trying to find Ellen's house...\"she mumbled, waving her finger in the air.\"Mom it's me, Cassandra,\" I said, as I approached her. I put my arm around her and felt her hair, drenched in sweat. I directed her to the car, repeating to her who I was. After several seconds, she finally registered that it was me. \"Oh oh, Cassandra? You're Cassandra? But I couldn't find Ellen's house-it's so weird-I couldn't find it...\" she said (with some other unrecognizable words mixed in here and there).\"I know momma, you shouldn't leave the house alone. I'm so glad you're okay,\" I said, helping her inside the car.She continued her chatter about how she had been looking for her sister's house and it was obvious that she was very flustered and very tired. My heart hurt as I looked at my poor, confused mom. I swallowed the lump in my throat and said a silent prayer of gratitude that she was okay. I took her home and got her settled in (lunch and nap) but despite my efforts, I couldn't get her to take off her jacket or drink any water (although she did take some sips of her root beer). She complained that she was cold and it was no wonder; her shirt was completely drenched in sweat. Her eyes were pink and her face still flushed even half an hour later, but I could not get her to cooperate with me to change her clothes or take more than a small sip of water. For now, she is resting in her bed. I am very glad that she is safe. It was a rough reminder that mom shouldn't be left alone. Next time, I'll just pay the darned appointment cancellation fee!",

I try to write in a positive, uplifting and encouraging manner. I try not to let dementia get me down and I try not to feel sorry for myself; there are millions of other people out there who have lost their moms at a young age. But some days are just harder than others to keep smiling. Today is just one of those days. Last night I was a bit emotional over some things, and as I lay in bed holding back the urge to cry, I turned to my husband and said,\"I wish I had my mom to talk to. She would know the right thing to say to me.\"There's just something about a mother's love that compares to none else. My mom was the kind of mom who was always there to lend a listening ear and support. She would tell me the truth-even if I was in the wrong-but I knew she loved me and I always felt like she had everything figured out. Sometimes I feel a little lost without her; it's hard to figure things out on my own.So, for those of you reading this post who still have a mother around, give her a call. Tell her you love her. Tell her how much she means to you. You never know what time you have left, and you never how much that time means until it's gone.",

I felt really bothered because the memory of it was right there, sitting at the back of my mind; I had a slight feeling that I knew what it about. But try as I might, I couldn't pull that memory to the forefront. I could not remember what I had dreamt. It was such a strange feeling- to have the sense that I knew what my dream was about, but unable to retrieve that memory. The thought hit me: I wonder if this is how my mom feels?Does she hear background noise, words in conversations around her, and have the sense that she knows what is being said but is unable to retrieve that memory and make sense of the words? Does she see the faces of her loved ones, and know that she knows them, yet she can't quite place them or figure it out? Do the words come to her, at the tip of her tongue, but she just can't spit it out? What a frustrating feeling it is, to feel the sense that there is something you should know, but unable to pinpoint it. I imagine this is mom's whole world now. Each day, more and more of the things she once knew are pushed to a place where she can longer retrieve the memory of it. ",

        "content": "Music is an entryway to the soul.Several people have sent me links about the effects of music with dementia patients. Music has been used as a form of therapy for Alzheimer's and dementia patients. I even read a story about one man, who had Alzheimer's and had not spoken in four years, who attempted to speak again after a month of music therapy. While much of how the brain and body processes music remains a mystery, this much we know: there is a strong connection between the brain's auditory cortex and it's limbic system, which is where all emotions are processed. Music has been known to relieve agitation, reduce stress, decrease problem behaviors and so on. Mom used to love listening to her music; even in her stages of dementia. I've noticed that lately, however, mom's radio has been very quiet. While I was over at mom's a few weeks ago, I decided to see if I could rekindle mom's love for music. As she sat on her bed, waiting for the clock to change to 12:00, I dusted off the CD player by her bedside and put in her favorite CD- a Mormon Tabernacle Greatest Hits CD.\"Mom, do you remember this music?\" I asked. Mom gaze did not break from the clock.\"Born Free!\" I sang in my operatic voice, trying to spark some memory with mom. She shifted slightly on the edge of her bed but continued to stare at her clock, ignoring my serenade. I changed the song to another familiar song.\"Oh what a beautiful morning! Oh what a beautiful day...\" I sang, again in my exaggerated opera voice. Mom used to wake me up with her own operatic version of this song long ago, when I was a child. Oh how it annoyed me then, in those early hours of the morning! And oh, how I'd do anything to hear her sing it just once more!I put my arms around mom and sang very theatrically, trying desperately for a response. Mom finally looked at me from the corner of her eye.\"It's 11:55 too, just a few more minutes and it's lunch time,\" she said, in her slurred speech.\"Mom, do you remember this song?\" I said, redirecting the conversation.After asking for a few more times, mom finally looked at her CD player suspiciously and said,\"I used to use that too and put on my good music too from that place far far away.\"\"Yes mom, you mean the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. This is them. This is your favorite CD. You used to listen to it all the time,\" I answered.After a couple more times of repeating that explanation, mom finally responded,\"No this isn't right, I don't know this.\"To be honest I wasn't really expecting that she would remember. But coming face to face with reality is always a little tough. After my silly serenades failed to spark any memory with mom, I just sat beside her and put my around her, choking back the tears. I told her that I loved her and that I missed her. Mom continued to stare at the clock and 11:58 she broke free from my embrace and stood in front of the clock. She waved her hand, mumbling,\"11:58, good, almost time to eat lunch when it changes to 11:59.\"No sooner than the digital clock read 11:59, mom sprinted out of her bedroom and down the hallway, towards the kitchen to make her sandwich. Dementia is such a confusing disease. Sometimes I feel as if we are stuck in limbo. Mom is still living, yet she's not really living. Each time I try to spark her memory or make a connection with her, I know my efforts are in vain, yet I can't help trying. ",

        "content": "Right around the time my baby turned 3, pajama time became a nightmare. He became very obstinate about changing from his clothes into his pj's. There were some nights where I had to hold him down, straddling my legs around his while sitting him down on my lap, as I attempted to undress and redress with pajamas. By the time we had made the switch I was breathless and my heart was racing from the intense work out. You get the picture.Now, picture this scenario with a grown adult. One of the struggles we have with my mom is that she doesn't change her clothes very often. Everyday, she puts on the same clothes as the day before. On occasion (maybe once a week),she will trade one outfit for another and throw her worn clothes into the laundry pile. You will notice in the pictures I post that most outfits look the same. A few weeks ago, while I was over at mom's, she smelled very...fragrant. Foundation stained the neck of her blouse and when I leaned in closer to mom, I could smell that her clothes desperately needed to be wash. The tricky part was getting her to change. She doesn't comprehend anything I try to say to her, so I knew explaining that wasn't worth the effort. And there was no way I could change her by myself. Besides that, it feels like a violation to have to undress my grown up mom against her will. Still, something needed to be done.Lucky for me, dad ended up coming home late that morning. We discussed the showering/clothes changing situation and I noted that mom's clothes really stunk. I'm sure it's not easy for my dad to have to take charge of mom, but he does really well at it. While I'm still nervous sometimes to go in and do things against her will, he just goes in and does it whether she likes it or not. I think she kind of looks at him like her father figure in some ways; she listens to him a little better. However...she was not understanding the concept of changing her clothes. \"Deana, we need to wash your clothes, they stink,\" dad said, a countless number of times. When mom was unresponsive to dad's prodding, dad sat beside her and started to take her shirt off.\"No, stop it, don't do that,\" mom said with a little smirk on her face. She glanced at me from the corner of her eyes with a mischevious look...like maybe she thought dad was trying to get frisky with her. Ha ha.\"No no, you can't do that, she can't see me,\" she remarked. Despite mom's protests, dad successfully got mom's shirt off and then started to work on her jeans. Mom became even more stubborn.\"No, no!\" she said, struggling but also still smirking. \"Deana, stand up,\" dad said, trying to get mom to stand to make it easier to slip off her pants. Of course, mom wouldn't budge. I figured I was going to have to step in and help dad.\"Here mom, stand up,\" I said. Together we pulled her off of the bed and held her in a standing position.\"No no, you shouldn't be doing that, no,\" mom continued.\"We need to change your clothes, mom,\" I said. I held her up while dad scooted her jeans down past her hips. Mom quickly dropped herself down on the bed and I began to take off her shoes. \"No no, why are you doing that, stop it. Stop it!\" Mom said, breaking out into a giggle while she swat at my hand. She laid down on the bed, eyeing us both suspiciously and giggling with protest. My dad and I started chuckling; as adamant as mom was that we leave her alone, her giggling and smirking made our chore a little more bearable. We were able to successfully pull off mom's clothing and dad immediately took a load of her laundry into the washer, handing her a clean pair of clothes to put on. Needless to say, it is much easier to catch those dirty clothes at night when she takes them off then it is to struggle with her to change once she's already dressed! She still isn't happy when her clothes disappear into the washer (she lays them out right next to her bed so she can see them in the morning), but we do what we gotta do!My son is 3 1/2 now and lucky for me, his phase didn't last too long. I'm happy to report that he's pretty easygoing these days about changing into his jammies. Unfortunately for my mom, the struggle has just begun.",

        "content": "This week has been especially rough with mom. She suddenly has bounds of energy and her happy feet have gotten even happier. She used to only try to go out walking in the mornings (walking to the store, her sister's house, etc) but this week it has been an all day ordeal. And even after she's gone out once already in the day, she is anxious to get out again in the afternoon (once a day used to be her limit). I have my theory as to why. I'll share that in my next post. On Monday, I became very nervous when I arrived at mom's house and found her putting on her bra; that is the sure sign that she is ready to get out of the house. She informed me that she was waiting until 11:00 and then she would go get her exercise. I don't have a problem keeping up with her, but I had a busy three-year-old to drag along with me and I wasn't sure I could wrangle both of them. I made a couple of phone calls (for back up) with no luck and then plopped down on the couch, trying to figure out my game plan. It was my lucky day. Just before 11, dad pulled up to the house; apparently he was done working early. I breathed a sigh of relief and warned my dad that mom was planning her escape. I wasn't sure where she planned on going, as she had no money that I knew of, but she had mentioned the name \"Marty\" in her mumblings to me earlier. Marty is a family friend from church, who lives in the next neighborhood up. I was pretty certain that mom wouldn't be able to remember which house was hers.Well...to make a really long story short, mom tried leaving the house several times that day. Dad hid her purse and coat to prevent her from leaving, and though she was pretty angry about it and frantically searching for her belongings, she ultimately decided she didn't need those things where she was going. She stood in the living room, looking out the window, the wheels in her head obviously turning. In a flash, mom darted out the front door and was sprinting up the street. My dad hopped in his truck and drove alongside her as she tried to navigate her way to Marty's house. At some point, she made some wrong turns and when dad knew that she wasn't going to give up, he steered her in the right direction. Upon arrival at Marty's house, mom marched right in the door without even so much as a knock. Fortunately, nobody was home (either that or they were hiding in the back room, lol) but dad was not amused that she was walking into someone's house uninvited. Can you imagine if he hadn't been with her to show her the right house?? Once dad returned home with mom, she ate her lunch and took a nap. When she got up from her nap, she was at it again. She sat at her computer games for a couple of minutes here and there but was distracted with ideas of more grand adventures outside the house. My dad blocked the front door several times, but as soon as his back was turned, she was out the door again. This time we hopped in my van and drove together. As I pulled over to the curbside a few feet in front of mom, dad quickly moved around the car (while I opened the back sliding door and set the child locks) and pulled her into the van. She struggled and was half-upset, half-giggly that dad was abducting her and seat-belting her down. She attempted to open the door but she was no match for my child locks. It's a good thing the neighbors know us or we may have been facing kidnapping charges ;)My dad and I had an errand to run together after that last incident, and my sister came to the house to \"mommysit\". In the two hours that we were gone, Christina spent most of that time guarding the front door and thwarting mom's efforts of getting away.That was the start of the week...and just about every day since. I'm really not too sure what transpired today, since I left out of town for a wedding. But for the past 3 days we've been chasing down mom. On Tuesday, we had a new caregiver at the house who didn't notice mom escape through the garage door. I got a call from the manager at the grocery store informing me that mom was up there, alone, ripping open boxes of Sleep Aid medicine. Apparently she found a stash of my dads change and it was just enough to buy her a bottle of pills. Later that afternoon, I went to check on her after I picked up my kids from school (we had nobody else to cover the afternoon) and I found the front door slightly ajar and the house empty. Thankfully, the Avon lady/mom's friend found her and brought her back home (she was trying to track her down for more eyeliner). Yesterday she took an escape to nowhere while that same friend (Avon lady) sat at the house with her. They ended up taking a walk around the block.So, after an exhausting week, we have been working diligently on refiguring her caregiving situation. It seemed to be working to only have a caregiver scheduled in the morning but she obviously needs supervision 24/7 now. We have some great ladies from church who have been coming over and helping out, along with some family members, but we still have a lot of time unaccounted for. We are in the process of hiring some other caregivers to fill in the gaps and should have that all straightened out by next week. In the meantime, my dad has his hands full!!",

Frequently asked question: Isn't there some kind of assistance that will help pay for an in-home caregiver?Yes, IF you are low income and IF you have no assets (which includes a house).If you are well-off, you can afford to pay for a nice company to come and care for your loved one.But, if you are stuck in the middle class, there is no help!!Story of our life. I could write an entire blog just on this topic, but I'll spare you the politics. The fact of the matter is this: if you are an average, middle class family, there is no help. You have to have nothing to get anything in our society. The most we can hope for is to find a facility that will accept mom's social security and disability (which is minimal) as payment to LIVE in their facility. And even then, what will the quality of that facility be? If we want something nice, we're gonna have to pay for it. If we want to keep her at home, there is no help financially for the middle class. It's been a huge source of frustration for me, and I'm sure even more so for my dad as he has the stress and heartache of how to care for his sweetheart and keep her happy at home as long as possible. I can't tell you how many times I've laid awake at night contemplating the issue; it sounds dramatic, I know. But until you've been in this situation, it's hard to know the struggle and the heartache it brings. I know our family is not alone. There are thousands, perhaps millions, who face this same dilemma. I have no idea how they do it. Oftentimes people have to give up the things they've worked hard for their entire lives (houses, cars, etc) in order to obtain proper care. I've met people who have had to sell all they have and move out of state just to make it work. This is tragic. Why can't more be done to help these people? Why can't the people who have worked hard to make their way in life be rewarded just the same as those who have struggled? It seems an injustice to me.This issue has weighed heavily on my mind for quite some time now. And then it came to me: I had (what I would consider) a brilliant idea. But every brilliant idea is also a little bit crazy, right? For those who know me, you know how much I HATE to fail. Too many times, we let our fear of failure hold us back from potentially accomplishing great things. If we let that fear hold us back, we can miss out on opportunities that can not only have a huge impact on our lives, but on the lives of those around us as well. And so, after months and months of deliberation, I've decided that I am ready to move forward with my crazy, brilliant idea. And I'm going to tell you ALL about it tomorrow!!! Stay tuned!!!",

        "content": "It\u2019s been kind of hard for me to write lately. Not just because I was finishing up summer break with the kids, but because I\u2019m kind of at a loss sometimes of what to write. Lately, every time I see mom, it seems as though she\u2019s slipping farther and farther away. Her hair and make up continues to get worse and worse (I didn\u2019t think that was possible) and her speech is more and more slurred together. Since she talks about the same 5 subjects over and over, I can usually make sense of what she\u2019s talking about; but for the average Joe listening to her it\u2019s hard to understand what she\u2019s saying. Last weekend, the kids and I went over to mom\u2019s house. My daughter (9 years old) had gone back into grandma\u2019s computer room to say hi. She came back to me in the living room, a few minutes later, with a somber look on her face. She looked up at me and from behind her purple, wire rimmed glasses I saw a small sadness in her eyes. With her lips slightly turned down, she looked up at me and quietly said, \u201cMommy, grandma doesn\u2019t remember me. She thought I was Marty.\u201d [Marty is a lady from church that we\u2019ve known for almost 30 years\u2026I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s who she was thinking of, since church ladies come over every week to help, or if she just mixed up names.] \u201cDid you tell her who you were?\u201d I asked, my heart aching for my little girl that her grandma didn\u2019t recognize her.  \u201cYes, I told her I was Aubrey and then she said \u2018you\u2019re Cassandra\u2019s daughter,\u201d Aubrey replied. I hugged Aubrey tightly and tried to reassure her, \u201cSee, she remembers you. She just got confused for a minute.\u201d Mom does get confused and after some explanation, she will sometimes remember who people are (particularly our more immediate family). But I think the days are numbered. She seems to un-recognize familiar faces more and more often; now with her own grandkids! In a couple of weeks, I will be taking my niece-daughter away to college in another state. She\u2019s already expressed her concerns that grandma probably won\u2019t remember her by the time she next comes back to visit. :(  ",

This should give you a good chuckle ;)Last week, dad arrived home from work one evening and was greeted by mom. She was talking a mile a minute as she filled him in on her day. She was very pleased with herself for accomplishing some chores around the house.\"It was so good too, I washed some dishes too...but something so weird happened, one plate disappeared and one plate broke apart it was so weird. Come here and see what happened it was so weird...\"Mom led dad into the kitchen and dad was trying to make sense of what mom was saying. He was preparing himself to find a broken dish; wondering how she would have managed to break the dish while washing it. He peered into the sink and, first, saw one plate washed and drying in the dish drainer. He then looked into the \"washing\" side of the sink and saw some sort of mess under the faucet. He looked a little closer, picked up the mess in his hand to inspect it further, and started to laugh. Mom had tried washing a paper plate!",

        "content": "Part of sharing this journey with my readers is passing along information that I have found helpful.Recently, I read a book entitled \"Confidence to Care\" by Molly Carpenter. This book was written as a resource for families struggling with dementia and Alzheimer's. It was a very easy read, easy to comprehend and was broken in to chapters addressing different behaviors and difficulties while dealing with this disease. For somebody who has a loved one in the beginning to mid phases of dementia, this book could be quite helpful in showing what to expect in the disease. There are also suggestions on how to handle certain behaviors. I think for many people who are new to dementia or don't quite understand all that it entails, this book would be very helpful and insightful.Something else that I liked about the book was that it gave dialogue to help guide in dealing with different scenarios. For people (especially) who are struggling to handle these behaviors, this is incredibly helpful! With that said, I think the dialogue portion is geared more towards Alzheimer's or dementias other than mom's (which is semantic). Mom's specific type of dementia makes it incredibly difficult for her to understand most of what we say to her (though it might have been more helpful in the beginning stages). The dialogue won't really help much in our specific situation.All in all, if you are new to dementia, or even struggling to understand certain behaviors, unsure of what to expect, etc, I would recommend this book to read. Like I said, it's easy-not filled with a bunch of medical mumbo jumbo that regular people like you and me can't understand-and there are many helpful tips. You can find it here at this link and for future reference, I will also list it under my \"books to read\" tab at the top of the page.",

        "content": "I had just sat down in the pew at church this morning with my family when a lady in my ward caught my attention and mouthed the words,\"Your mom is looking for you.\"I glanced behind me to the doorway which separates the chapel and foyer, and saw my mom. She was wearing her pink \"mother-of-the-bride\" dress, which hangs loosely on her now, adorned with delicate beading on top of layers of chiffon. Underneath her short sleeved dress, she wore a long sleeved, pink cotton shirt. Thick, white cotton socks peeked out from underneath the hem of her dress. She wore the only shoes she ever wears: her brown, tennis-shoe-style Skechers that have velcro straps criss-crossing her foot. Her face was splotched with dark, orange foundation which stopped harshly at her jawline, contrasting her pale white neck and the areas she missed around her eyes and mouth. Her eyelids were smudged with dark, brown eyeshadow. Surely, she was a sight to see.In our church, we separate ourselves by geographical boundaries into wards; think of it like boundaries for schools. Even though I live five minutes away from my parents, we attend different wards. At one time, before a boundary realignment, my parents were a part of this ward (so they know many of the church members in our ward); when the lines were redrawn, their neighborhood was put in the next ward over. However, we do attend the same building. Our congregation services overlap by 1/2 hour; my parent's ward is finishing up in their class just as our ward is arriving for our main meeting (called sacrament meeting). Mom always looks for me during this overlap time, so it was no surprise to see her in the doorway looking for me (although usually I catch her in the halls). To tell you the truth, I think it's sweet that she looks for me and I look forward to her finding me each week at church. When I saw mom, I stood up and walked toward the doorway (we still had another minute or so until our service started, and I could tell she wanted to say hi). As I walked towards the back of the chapel, I glanced up and saw a new couple that I had never seen before in our ward (which goes without saying that they don't know me, or my mom). The husband turned his head towards the doorway and immediately I saw his eyes bulge open in wide surprise as he caught sight of my mom. He leaned over to his wife and whispered something in her ear and I saw her eyes move towards the doorway as well. They both looked at my mom, as if she were in some kind of freak show and instinctively I approached my mom and put a protective arm around her, turning her away from spectators. I gave her a hug and told her I was happy to see her. Of course she wasn't satisfied with my greeting alone; she wanted to see the kids too. \"Is that Jeff too? And where's Maurina and Am-Amber, is that them too?\" she asked, peering back into the chapel.She marched right into the chapel and stood, as the service was beginning and with everyone else around her sitting, in the pew where my family was sitting. She talked in a rather loud voice, greeting each of the kids and my husband. I followed in behind her and convinced her to sit down with us for a few minutes. The opening prayer was given and mom talked right through it,\"I used to know so many people in this ward, I don't remember so many people anymore but there was that one man who was a bishop so long ago and his wife too...\" she continued to talk as I gently rubbed her arm and whispered to her that they were giving a prayer, suggesting that we should fold our arms and be quiet. She didn't follow my lead. Fortunately, a lot of people know my mom and are aware of her situation, so they simply smiled or pretended not to notice; I imagine some might have found it a bit amusing. But for those people who don't know my mom, I'm sure they were caught a little off guard with this bizarre woman.After a couple of minutes, mom became restless and told me she was leaving back to her class. She abruptly got up and walked out of the chapel and when I turned back to watch her exit the room, I saw the couple look her again. To be honest, I can't blame them for looking twice at my mom; she does stick out like a sore thumb. Admittedly, if I were in their shoes, I might do the same thing. I'm not embarrassed or ashamed of my mom in the least; obviously this is something she can't help. But as the congregation began to sing the next hymn, I found myself blinking back tears for my mom and swallowing a lump in my throat. My beautiful mother, in her right mind, would be completely embarrassed to be made a spectacle of. She always took great pride in her appearance. Thankfully, she is unaware of the attention she attracts when she leaves the house. I'm not mad that people turn their heads, but it hurts all the same; the pain is for my mom. This is definitely a learning experience for me. For one, I have to learn to have a thick skin; no easy task for a girl who was always pegged as being \"over-sensitive\". For another, I have definitely learned to think twice before I stare at or make assumptions about a person's appearance. You never know what battles a person is fighting.",

        "content": "Mom might not remember much about holidays, but the one thing she does remember is birthdays. Somehow, she can remember everyone's birthday and she always has a card ready for the birthday person weeks, sometimes even months, before their special day. I know it really brings a smile to our family member's faces when mom has a card for them on their birthdays. Yesterday I had the fun job of taking mom to the Dollar Tree to stock up on her birthday cards FOR THE YEAR. When dad asked me if I would do it, I didn't think it was any big deal. I told him to tell her to be ready a little bit early (10:15) so we would have time to walk up there, since she is obsessed with walking wherever she wants to go.I arrived at mom's house at 10:00 and she had barely gotten out of the shower. By the time she was ready to go it was 10:45 and we didn't really have time to walk up there and back, seeing how I have to get my son from Kindergarten at noon. But mom was insistent that she walk at least a portion of the way. So I let her walk up to the corner of the street, where she then got in my car and drove the rest of the way to the Dollar Tree.Once at the Dollar Tree, mom went straight to the aisle of cards, her birthday/anniversary list in hand. She had her list categorized by each month, with each of her family member's names next to the month that their birthday fell in. On her list were kids, grandkids, one childhood friend, Cheryl, one niece, all of her brothers and sisters, some of their spouses, and most of my dad's siblings (and some of their spouses). There were a few people she forgot on the list, but I noticed those are the sisters-in-law that live farther away who we rarely see. At the top of the paper she wrote down a few names to remember for anniversaries: Joe and Natalie, Jeff and Starla, Cassandra and Jeff (don't ask me why she didn't list my sister or any of her other siblings). There were nearly 30 names in all on her list.For the next 40 minutes, mom went from one aisle of cards to the next (the men's cards and anniversary cards were on the back side of the aisle rack with the women's and valentine's cards). She went from one side to the other, going down her list one-by-one (in order), looking for a card for each person in the various card sections. I bounced between attempting to help mom and confiscating toys that my two year old would pick up and try to open from the nearby toy aisle.\"George...who's George, who did I mean here, George...\" mom mumbled, studying her list intently.\"Mom, George...he's dad's brother, your brother-in-law,\" I explained.We went through this a few times throughout the trip as I tried really hard to keep patient and explain who each person was (all the while rangling a restless little boy). When she really got \"stuck\", I picked up a card for her. Of course, it couldn't be just any card. It had to have the word \"sister\" or \"grandson\" or \"brother\" written on the front of the card or else it was no good. But that was her only requirement. When we made our way to \"June\", mom immediately searched for the \"grand-daughter\" section of cards. Both myself and my two siblings each have a daughter born within 4 days of eachother in June! As soon as mom found the cards with the word \"grand-daughter\" written across the top, she counted out three cards, without reading anymore, and put them in her basket. She didn't open a single card up to read the inside. In fact, she picked up an anniversary card for one of the couples which was intended to be from one spouse to another. When she wasn't looking I switched it out for her, ha ha.I thought card shopping would be a piece of cake. But nothing about dementia is a piece of cake! Aside from splitting my attention between my 2-year-old and 52-year-old, mom had absolutely no concept of the time. I mentioned earlier that I had a Kindergartener to pick up from school at noon. Mom was beginning to stress me out after 40 minutes of picking out cards. Twice, she stopped to count how many cards she had...all 30 of them. And then she had to compare that to the number of names she had written on her list. Meanwhile, I was looking at my clock and letting mom know that I had to leave very soon. I was afraid she'd never finish in time!\"Mom, we need to go. I have to get Cody from school; we need to get in line...\" I said, getting the same response from mom as I would have expected to get from the wall. No matter how many times I said it, mom simply couldn't comprehend (or seem to hear) me telling her that it was time to go. By the time I got her to the line, there were five people ahead of me. Another teller finally opened up another register, and the lady in front of me (who apparently caught on to my struggle) told me to go ahead of her. I was able to get mom home and over to the school just in the nick of time to get my son from school, but talk about cutting it close! I think I'm going to have to rethink taking her out shopping on Monday mornings!",

        "content": "I really need to stop reading the internet. My Aunt warned me not to read any more on the internet. But I didn\u2019t listen. Last June, I went in for my yearly physical. Disclaimer: it had actually been 2 years since my prior physical and I figured I had better check in on myself. I had gestational diabetes with all 3 pregnancies which puts me at risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future, so it\u2019s kind of important to get my yearly physicals to make sure I haven\u2019t developed the dreaded disease; I try to keep up on that.  After a quick physical inspection, the doctor then asked me a series of questions before sending me to the lab for standard blood work. One of the questions she asked was, \u201cAre you depressed?\u201d I paused for a minute, caught a little off guard. If I was being totally honest, sure, you could say I\u2019ve been struggling with a bit of depression. For those of you who read my blog regularly, you know what I\u2019ve been through this year. I figured it would be almost inhuman to NOT feel some sort of depression.  I was going to answer \u201cno\u201d. After all, it wasn\u2019t as if I was unable to get out of bed in the morning. I had no thoughts of hurting myself or others. To be put on meds was the last thing I wanted. There was no reason to be a drama queen about it. But when I opened my mouth, the word \u201cyes\u201d escaped my tongue. I surprised even myself.  I explained to her that I had gone through some traumatic events this year and that I was also dealing with the loss of my mother to dementia. She asked a few more questions [\u201cAre you frequently tired?\u201d \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cDo you have low energy?\u201d \u201cYes\u201d, etc]. She told me that she would add a hormone check to my lab work.  A couple of weeks later, I learned that I have hypothyroidism, meaning, my thyroid is not creating enough hormones. She put me on medication, told me I could choose to be monitored for a while or choose to meet with a specialist. Of course I chose the specialist. So, over the past 5 months I have met with the specialist, had an ultrasound on my thyroid (which revealed nodules), had even more blood work done, had a very painful biopsy which required needles going through my neck and the conclusions are this:  1. I do not have thyroid cancer (hooray!!) 2. I have an auto immune disease called Hashimoto\u2019s Disease, which basically means that my immune system is attacking/destroying my thyroid. It\u2019s not the end of the world. I have to take a pill everyday for the rest of my life. Once we establish the right dose of medication (4 months and we\u2019re still working to figure it out!!) monitoring and adjustments will continue to be needed, as it is a progressive disease. I will have to have monitoring and possibly more biopsies in the future (ick!). When the doctor gave me the diagnosis of Hashimoto\u2019s disease, he told me, \u201cYou can read about Hashimoto\u2019s on the internet.\u201d [Really???] I like to educate myself, so I took his advice. And this time, I wish I hadn\u2019t because it brings back one of my greatest fears. Dementia. I read that hypothyroidism and Hashimoto\u2019s disease can lead to dementia. Yep, it\u2019s true. Thyroid problems can lead to memory problems. I even read posts from real people who were experiencing it. Whether being on the right dose of medication will help or not is yet to be determined; I\u2019ve read mixed reviews. Although I did read that it can be reversed with proper medications.  The truth of the matter is this: I already find myself having \u201cbrain farts\u201d. This isn\u2019t made up because of my findings; for a few years now I\u2019ve been blaming my forgetfulness on \u201cpregnancy brain\u201d or \u201cmommy brain.\u201d And maybe it is. But every time I think of that evil disease called dementia, my fears settle in. When I see \u201cthyroid\u201d and \u201cdementia\u201d used in the same sentence, I feel even more uneasy. I know that fear is no way to live life, but how can I not fear that I will share a similar fate as my mom?  For every time I walk to the cupboard only to stand there with a blank stare, unsure of what I was looking for; for every time a name slips my brain; for every night I forget to sign my son\u2019s homework packet; for every time I just don\u2019t have it altogether, I worry: am I headed down the same road as my mother?

        "content": "Our family has somewhat of a tradition to gather together on Sunday afternoons for family dinner. I remember when I was first married and moved away from home. I looked forward to those Sunday dinners all week; not just for the fabulous meals that mom had prepared, but for the time to visit with my family. Mom equally loved our Sunday family time together and it was important to both my parents to have their kids gather together at least one day a week.  About 5 years ago, things started to change. Mom didn\u2019t have the same resolve about us getting together. In fact, sometimes it seemed she was actually relieved if Sunday dinner didn\u2019t happen or she\u2019d find excuses to not have it. Her cooking variety became slimmer and slimmer; in fact, it kind of became a joke in the family, \u201cWhat will be for family dinner this week\u2026tacos or spaghetti?\u201d Of course mom hasn\u2019t participated in preparing a meal for more than a couple years now. Nowadays she doesn\u2019t interact much with the family at all during our time together. If dinner is at her house, she stays in the office playing Free Cell on the computer; if it\u2019s at my house she is on my computer playing her games. More recently (within the past few months), she hasn\u2019t wanted to come over at all when dinner is at my house. It\u2019s been like pulling teeth to get her to come. Yesterday, family dinner was at my house. It was no surprise when dad stopped by without mom. We asked where she was, knowing full well that she was at home. Dad got a smirk on his face and shook his head, as he told us, \u201cShe hid from me.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean she hid from you?\u201d I asked, thinking she must have just locked herself in her room. [Disclaimer: It would be much better if dad retold this so that I don\u2019t get anything mixed up, but I\u2019ll do my best to write it as I remember him telling me]. Dad told us of the events of the afternoon, starting from the time he woke up from his nap in the living room. He walked back to their bedroom and found that it was locked. He knocked for mom to answer the door, telling her to open up and that it was time to come to my house. No answer. He got the bedroom key and walked into the room. To his surprise, mom was not there. He looked around and could not find her. He looked in other rooms in the house and began to panic a little, wondering if she had escaped somewhere while he was napping. He went back to his bedroom to find mom on the floor, next to his side of the bed, in-between the bed and the french door. She was laying down on a pillow. When he asked her what she was doing there, she replied, \u201cI\u2019m hiding from you. I don\u2019t want to go to Cassandra\u2019s\u201d. Dad got her off the floor and she followed him to the kitchen, talking his ear off. I don\u2019t remember what he said was going on in the kitchen, but he said that one minute they were talking and the next minute he turned around and she was gone. He went to get her; it was time to leave to come over to my house. He went to her usual afternoon retreat: the computer. She wasn\u2019t there. He went back to his bedroom and his search came up empty once again. He called her name. No answer. Finally, he made his way into the spare bedroom, thinking maybe she had hid in the closet. And there, in front of the closet and on the side of the TV stand, mom was crouched down, hands over her head, hiding from dad. We were all chuckling as dad told the story. I guess mom really didn\u2019t want to come over to my house!! This is a new one for mom\u2026hiding. If any of you caregivers are reading this, beware!

        "content": "I think I\u2019ve written in other posts that mom\u2019s latest fixation is taking walks. We have concerns with her walking by herself, so to prevent catastrophe, we have \u201cbabysitters\u201d over daily to keep an eye on those happy feet.  A couple of weeks ago, on a Friday, a lady from church was over watching mom. Mom was adamant that she was walking to her sister\u2019s house that day (about 1 - 1 1/2 miles down the road) and was quite annoyed that people were over everyday to visit when all she really wanted to do was go for a walk by herself. This sweet sister from church told mom she would be delighted to walk with her, so off they went on their walk to my Aunt\u2019s house. Once at my Aunt\u2019s house, my Aunt told this lady that she would make sure mom got home safely and that she need not stay with her the rest of their visit. A little after noon time, my cousin drove my mom back home to her house. Today mom was at it again. I got a text from my Aunt Ellen to say that mom had walked over to her house. That same lady from church had gone with her and once they were at my Aunt\u2019s house, she left mom to visit with her sister. My Aunt had planned on driving her home. However, when mom was ready to go home, Aunt Ellen couldn\u2019t find her car keys. Waiting patiently is not an ability mom possesses any longer. As my Aunt went to change her clothes and look for her keys, mom slipped out the front door. Aunt Ellen is disabled, so she was unable to chase after her and she still hadn\u2019t found her keys.  Meanwhile\u2026I was picking my son up from Kindergarten and never heard the notification that I had received a new text. I had just gotten in the door, was trying to cool off from the heat outside and sat down in my chair, thinking of what to make the boys for lunch. I made a quick phone call to handle a business matter. As I was on the house phone, my cell phone rang and I saw that it was my other Aunt (Claudia). I didn\u2019t think much about it (she wasn\u2019t with my mom today, so I never thought it would be a call about mom) so I dismissed the call as I finished up my other phone call. When I hung up the phone, I opened up my cell phone just in time to receive a second text from my Aunt Ellen, entitled: \u201cUrgent\u201d. I read through the 2 texts to learn that mom had gotten away before Aunt Ellen could stop her. I texted her back to ask if she had found her keys, knowing she most likely hadn\u2019t, and immediately loaded the boys back into their car seats.  Right as I was pulling out of the driveway, my dad called. \u201cI\u2019m on my way out the door to look for mom,\u201d I said, knowing that was exactly why he was calling. Dad was frustrated. This was exactly the kind of fiasco that he has been worried about and has tried so hard to avoid. He tried calling mom\u2019s cell phone, which led him straight to voicemail. His fear was that mom had become confused on her way back and lost her way. And with her not answering her phone, it added more stress to the situation. I tried to reassure my dad that mom getting lost would be the last of our worries. I worried more about her not recognizing traffic and getting hit by a car, or collapsing from the 100 degree heat. In our meetings with UCLA, and in my research on semantic dementia, the memory of how to get from one familiar place to the next remains preserved\u2026at least, until the later stages. However, as I was talking with dad and driving around, I saw no signs of mom. I drove around the route that I thought she was most likely to take. Then I looped back around to try the alternative roads she could have turned down. Still no mom. I was beginning to get a little worried. I hung up with dad to call Aunt Ellen to verify what time she left her house; surely she couldn\u2019t have made it all the way home yet. As I made my way around the loop for a 3rd time, Aunt Ellen on the line, I finally saw mom. Relief swept over me when I saw her face. I pulled the car over to the curb, where mom stopped and stood by as if she was waiting for me to drive past. She finally realized who I was and opened the passenger door. \u201cOh good, it\u2019s so good you were driving here too because I\u2019m so sweaty and tired too and I got lost coming back; I went to Ellen\u2019s and I took the wrong way, I went the other way instead of that way and it was so weird too and I couldn\u2019t find the right street and then I had to go all the way back around and then I came this way too so it\u2019s so good you found me\u2026.\u201d On and on she rambled, hardly pausing to breathe, let alone allow me to get a word in. Over and over I asked, \u201cWhere is your phone? Mom, dad was trying to call you, why aren\u2019t you answering your phone?\u201d When she finally heard what I was asking, she replied, \u201cMy phone? Here, it\u2019s broken, it wouldn\u2019t work so I tried to fix it at Ellen\u2019s but it won\u2019t work so I have to take it home too and charge it\u2026\u201d I tried to explain to her that she cannot leave the house without making sure her phone works and furthermore, she should not be walking alone. She didn\u2019t hear a word I said. Instead, she rambled on and on about her walk, how much she was sweating, how the lady from church walked her to her sister\u2019s. On and on she went until I pulled into her driveway. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe mom, please don\u2019t scare us again,\u201d I said (talking over her, of course). Mom unlatched her seatbelt and opened her door. \u201cOh I need to see if the mail\u2019s here too. It\u2019s so good that you saw me, I\u2019m so sweaty I\u2019m gonna go get the mail now and go inside.\u201d  And with that, she shut the car door and walked away.  I am glad that mom was safe today. One thing is clear\u2026we can\u2019t rely on mom\u2019s ability to navigate anymore. Sadly, that ability is declining with everything else. And now some more hard begins, as dad has to figure out how keep mom \u201cunder control\u201d while he is gone for the day at work. :/  ",

        "content": "I think mom has been feeling a little confined lately. Not that there\u2019s a whole lot she likes to do outside of the house. But I think she senses that her independence is slowly being taken away and is determined to keep a hold of it. Her newest fixation is taking walks; I\u2019m not talking about a leisurely walk. Her walks have a purpose, a destination. Her favorite places to walk are: her sister Ellen\u2019s house (who lives about a mile to a mile and a half up the street), the bank and the grocery store (both are half a mile up the street).  It\u2019s good that mom wants to get out. She needs to do more than just sit at her computer all day long. Plus it\u2019s good exercise. But there a few concerns we have with mom leaving the house.  1. What if something happens to her while she\u2019s out and none of us aware of her whereabouts?  2. She\u2019s in her own little world\u2026will she notice the car driving down the road as she crosses (or any other dangers)?  3. How will people respond to her when they come in contact with her? Will they think she\u2019s on drugs and call the police? (this might sound silly, but it\u2019s happened to many people with dementia). 4. We have concerns about her withdrawing money from the bank as well as buying things that she\u2019s not supposed to be buying (such as medicines). We know that the time she usually leaves the house is in the morning between 10 and noon. She rarely emerges from her room before 10:00 am, and she is religious about her lunch and naptimes. She seldom ever tries to walk after her naptime (before dinner); I\u2019m not sure why, but morning seems to be primetime for getting out of the house. We\u2019ve taken measures to ensure mom\u2019s safety. We try to make sure that someone is there each morning. Each week, I take a morning, my Aunt and Uncle take 2 mornings, and sweet ladies from church have been taking 2 mornings a week. Mom is growing more and more resentful about having people there in the morning because she wants to do these things alone (likely because she knows she isn\u2019t supposed to be doing these things). Today, she thought she would be sneaky and charge out the door before my Aunt and Uncle knew what was going on. Luckily, they were on the ball. He called me shortly after 10:00 to let me know that mom had escaped and that my Aunt ran after her. I will paste his account here (taken from his facebook update) to give you a more accurate synopsis of the morning\u2019s events: \u201cMore excitement today\u2014more for my wife than myself. Shortly after arriving today at my sisters's house she got \"happy feet\". She emerged from her bedroom purse over shoulder raring to go walking to the bank and supermarket. In a flash she was out the door with my wife chasing her. Although she came with no hat, she knew it would be necessary to have to walk to the store with Deana lest something dreadful happen in spite of the sweltering heat. Fortunately my wife had a bottle of water with her. My wife hung onto Deana's arm to keep from being left in the dust. Deana is tall and Tina is short. At the bank it was a fiasco. The teller asked for ID and it was as if she had asked in German. My wife tipped off the teller and called my niece to let the teller know about what was happening. The teller was very helpful and said there was \"no money\" in the account. (There was.)Then she was off to the market without any money. Her goal was to buy some sleeping pills. A big no-no! While searching for the brand she uses, she opened the bottles and broke the foil seals to be sure they were her favorite ones. Startled, my wife told her she couldn't open the product. Big mistake! Deana snapped back telling her to stop telling her what to do!! When she found her pills, it was off to the checkout stand. Problem was, she did not have the money to pay! After standing in line at checkout, the line behind her grew and grew. Frustrated, she spied the small change box on the checkout counter where people make charity donations. \"I can use that money people have thrown away!\" My wife had to convince her she couldn't have it. Finally she left it all behind and walk out of the store. I'm betting next time she gets happy feet, she won't let my wife tag along. I can wait for that!\u201d I\u2019m afraid my mom has worn my dear Aunt out today! My Uncle also updated me that mom is now giving my Tia Tina the silent treatment (that\u2019s mom\u2019s way of letting us know she\u2019s unhappy with you!) I\u2019m sure my poor dad will get an earful (from mom) when he gets home as well. Just another fun day of dementia.  ",

        "content": "Since mom\u2019s diagnosis (in March of 2012), she has been going in for check ups every 6 months or so. This past Monday was another 6 month check up. The first few visits were fairly beneficial. We were educated a lot on the disease. Last visit (in January), the Dr. was able to recommend medications to help mom with the rigidity and OCD behaviors that come with this disease. But the more and more we go, the more fight mom gives and the less we feel we are getting out of the visits.  It\u2019s not that UCLA isn\u2019t doing their job well. It\u2019s just that there is no treatment for the disease. She is pretty much off the scale that they use for semantic dementia. She can\u2019t identify much of anything from picture anymore. The one category she can still somewhat identify is the pictures of animals. She cannot name the animal correctly (she either doesn\u2019t recognize it as anything or she classifies every animal as a dog) but she still categorizes most pictures as \u201canimals\u201d. Other pictures shown to her (house, comb, toothbrush, pictures of famous people, etc) elicit a blank stare and no response.  The Dr. reviews with us the symptoms of semantic dementia and reaffirms how mom\u2019s behaviors are consistent with the disease. At this point, we are all too familiar with the symptoms. We\u2019ve done our research and taken good notes. We know what is to come in the future. Not to sound like \u201cknow-it-alls\u201d, but there isn\u2019t much that they can tell us that we haven\u2019t already heard. They can\u2019t give any estimate of how long until mom reaches the next phase. Every case is individual. Semantic dementia is known to be one of the longer-running dementias; he said it could last as long as a couple of decades. With mom\u2019s rate of progression, I\u2019m not sure that it will last that long for her. In fact, I pray it doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t say that in a cold-hearted way; rather, I mean it quite the opposite.  Mom\u2019s quality of life is gone. The only thing she has to look forward to each day is her computer games. She has no interest any longer in her grandkids or even visiting with her family for Sunday dinner (or any dinner). Taking care of her is quite stressful. It is heartbreaking to see her decline more and more and it is heart wrenching as we sit helplessly by and watch the person we once loved so dearly slip further and further away. Dementia is a cruel disease. For my own tracking purposes, I would like to note some characteristics of where she\u2019s at in this disease, as of July 2013 (to compare with 6 months ago):  Weight: Mom weighed in at 134 lbs. on UCLA\u2019s scale. This is 6 pounds less than 6 months ago, but about 8 pounds more than a month ago when she was having her eating/gall bladder issues.  Eating: Mom is down to maybe 5 things that she will eat. She starts the day off with Slim Fast (unbeknownst to her, we have substituted this with Instant Breakfast); she eats a turkey and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch; she will snack on Poppycock, fritos, strawberries or pineapple for her afternoon snack; for dinner she may drink an Ensure or she might make herself some tortellini and mixed vegetables. Rarely will she eat anything else, but she will still eat hamburgers and burritos as well.  Daily Activities: Mom occasionally, very occasionally, do a load of laundry here or there. It usually only includes her own laundry (not dad\u2019s) and maybe some towels. I never see her do dishes anymore. She sits in front of the computer before lunch and after nap to play Spider Solitaire. Sometimes she will go on walks but only if she has a purpose: a trip to the bank, grocery store or a visit to her sister. She rarely wants to come to family dinners or family functions and only does come when she is forced.  Personal Hygiene: She is still able to groom herself. She showers almost everyday. She puts on her make-up and styles her hair everyday (though it may not look as nice as it once did). She still dyes her hair every 6 weeks on the dot and she brushes her teeth frequently. I have noticed that she is not as diligent about washing her hands when necessary. For example, in the hospital she washed herself with a paper towel in some private areas and wasn\u2019t going to wash her hands afterwards (ewe!).  Conversation: It is becoming increasingly difficult to hold a conversation with mom. She doesn\u2019t comprehend most of what we say. She seems to pick out only key words in conversations that she understands but cannot comprehend the whole of what we are trying to say. Many times, she gives us blank stares when we talk to her and we receive no response. She will talk a mile a minute about what she wants to talk about, but she seems to hear nothing we say in response. Her speech is somewhat slurred together and mumbled, particularly when she can\u2019t seem to find the right words to communicate.  Behavior: She has become a little bit more confrontational. I first noticed this in the hospital and noticed it again the other night, when she was insistent on loading her food in their trailer refrigerator (packing for a trip); she broke one of the shelves on the fridge and when my dad tried to fix it, she kept getting in his way and insisting he put her food in the fridge \u201cnow\u201d, despite his attempts to redirect him. At one point, he was physically trying to move her back and she raised her fist at him. So far she hasn\u2019t struck anybody\u2026let\u2019s hope it stays that way.  Sleep: She wakes up around 8:00 or 8:30. Sometimes she will sleep in late, until after 9:00, if she\u2019s had a rough night or a rough day before. She still naps at 1:00 on the dot until 2:30. She goes to her room by 8:00 to take her medicine and tuck herself into bed. Dad says she gets up at 10:00 pm every night to go to the bathroom and then goes back to bed. Sometimes she\u2019ll wake up in the middle of the night and trying talking to my dad.   ",

        "content": "Some days are good and others are bad. Yesterday was bad. Really bad. After spending four uncomfortable, frustrating days in the hospital, mom was more than ready to go home. Her surgery had been set for today, but she was ready to go. She remembered back to her heart surgery, when she came into the hospital the morning of the surgery and she thought this should be the same way.  My dad already had to convince her to stay Monday night. So we knew she would be a little antsy by the following morning. Dad had a job to finish up so we lined up family to be there with mom all morning and afternoon until he could return. My Aunt was scheduled to stay with her until noon and I was to arrive shortly thereafter once I had finished up some errands. I received a phone call from my Aunt at 11:30 to let me know that she had had enough and was leaving. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling good and I\u2019m not in the mood for this,\u201d she reported. Apparently, mom was insisting that she was going home and when this Aunt told her she wasn\u2019t going to take her, mom told her she could just leave. So she did. I was in the middle of dropping my step-daughter off at the airport when I received the call, so it wasn\u2019t a situation where I could get over there quickly. I called my mother-in-law, who was volunteering at the hospital that day, and she went over to check on mom and to ask a nurse to sit with her until I arrived. I got to the hospital about an hour later and found mom peacefully resting in her bed, eyes closed. As soon as she heard me, her eyes popped wide open and she sat up, pulling her covers down and revealing her normal clothes on her body.  \u201cOh good, they said I could go home now too and I can just come back in the morning before the surgery too and I can go home tonight and rest which is so good too because I need to have a shower and do my hair and my make up and other things too\u2026\u201d I looked over at the nurse aid who sat silently by while shaking her head \u201cno\u201d. I told mom that I didn\u2019t think she could go home and she protested, \u201cYes, they told me I could.\u201d I called in her nurse who affirmed to me that she was not able to go home. Mom became irate.  \u201cI can too go home, they told me I could!\u201d We went back and forth for several minutes as I tried to ask her who told her she could go (which she couldn\u2019t tell me) and explain to her that she wasn\u2019t able to go home. Of course she understood nothing I said and became very angry with me for \u201cnot supporting\u201d her and taking her home. She began yelling at me, and the nurse, and I shut the door to prevent everyone in the wing from hearing her. \u201cI want to go home, you can\u2019t keep me here!\u2026If you won\u2019t take me then I\u2019ll go down and pay someone to take me!\u2026you can\u2019t tell me what to do!\u2026if nobody is gonna support me then I\u2019ll just kill myself!\u2026I wanna go home dammit!!\u2026\u201d I felt totally lost on how to handle this. I fought back the tears and all I could think of was to tell her, \u201cLet\u2019s just wait here for dad, okay? You can\u2019t leave without dad anyway, so let\u2019s just wait. Will you please sit on the bed?\u201d After much coaxing, mom sat down on the bed. The nurse told me he had ordered a psych evaluation. I told him to cancel the test. That comment set me over the edge\u2026my mom didn\u2019t need a psych evaluation, she needed her surgery and to get the heck out of that place! I was angry at the mere suggestion and was afraid they wanted to lock my mom away, figuring they must have ordered the test because of her \u201ckill myself\u201d comment.  Mom sat down on the bed, her overnight bag on top of her lap, and waited for dad to pick her up and take her home. I breathed a sigh of relief that for the moment; she had settled down. I texted my dad to let him know the situation and as soon as I glanced back up, I noticed that mom had silently pulled out her IV. \u201cMom, you can\u2019t take that out,\u201d I said, but I was too late.  \u201cYes I have to take this out. I\u2019m going home. Your dad is going to take me home and I hope he\u2019ll take me to a really good dinner too.\u201d And so my very long afternoon continued. Every once in a while, mom would stand up and start insisting I take her home. I tried and tried to convince her to sit down and wait for dad but as the day wore on, the waiting became more difficult.  They moved her to another room, which was closer to the nurses station and in a quieter location (and much farther away from her room that sat right next to the elevator). It was a chore to get her to move. I had to convince her that it was much quieter down there (she continually complains about how noisy it is there) and I told her that they were bringing someone else in the room; it would be much better to go wait in a room by herself without a roommate. It worked and she finally followed to the next room.  As the hours wore on, mom became more and more restless. When she realized she couldn\u2019t convince me to take her home, she tried manipulation. \u201cThey told me I could exercise so I need to go for a walk too.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re going for a walk, you need to leave your overnight bag here,\u201d I replied, knowing full well of her intentions to escape downstairs. By 3:00, I had to physically get up and stand at the door to prevent her from leaving. By this point, a social worker had arrived and I vented all of my frustrations of the hospital and our situation with her. She was very compassionate and helped me in whatever way was possible, but of course the surgery was completely dependent on the doctor and his schedule. The social worker stood at the door with me as mom tried to move me aside and shouted, \u201cI\u2019m the mom, you\u2019re the daughter, you can\u2019t tell me what to do!!\u201d It took every ounce of self control to hold back my tears and not have a break down right there in her hospital room. I asked the social worker if there was some medication to calm her down. \u201cThat\u2019s what the psych evaluation is for,\u201d she answered. Why the heck didn\u2019t the nurse tell me that?? Here I was thinking they wanted to evaluate her and lock her away when the test was simply for evaluating if she needed something to calm her down. She apologized for the miscommunication (or lack of) and reassured me that the test was in no way designed to send her away to a mental hospital; we decided to ask for the doctor to come evaluate her. My other Aunt (mom\u2019s other sister) showed up and tried to help me calm mom down. I was so thankful to have some extra help; it was very difficult to manage on my own. By late afternoon I had both the social worker and my Aunt to help keep me sane.  My dad finally arrived to the hospital around 5:00 and I was never so thankful to see him!! I knew (and warned him) that all hell would break loose once again as soon as he got there. And it did. Mom was angry that dad wouldn\u2019t take her home.  \u201cNo, I can go, they told me I could go! I need to go home and shower and use my really good soap stuff and wash my hair real good and do my hair too and my make-up and other things too. And I need my clean clothes too, these are too dirty.\u201d \u201cDear, look. I brought all your good stuff, see?\u201d  Dad took out her favorite body washes and laid out each piece of make-up and article of clothing to show that he hadn\u2019t missed a thing. She refused. She held on tight to her bag (it had been on her lap or on her shoulder the entire time I was there). The tantrum went on. She paced the room, she tried to push through my dad, she tried manipulating and bribing my dad to take her home, she yelled, she cursed, she flipped my dad off several times. Through it all, my dad remained calm, patient and even tried to make light of the situation and tried to joke around with her a bit. He reassured her that he would stay with her the entire night. He did a great job and after another hour or so of her tantrums, she finally sat on the bed. I think dad might have finally found his leverage with her-he started talking about the trip she wants to take to Utah this summer and he told her that she had to get better and have the surgery if she wanted to go (of course it took a lot of repeating and explaining over and over before she caught on\u2026he was talking about all the people they would visit and the places they would go). At this point, her sedative finally arrived (nearly 2 hours after I asked for it). They gave her a shot in her shoulder; she whined about them hurting her and then sat silent for several minutes.  And then, out nowhere, she sat up and began fumbling through her things. \u201cWhat are you looking for dear?\u201d dad asked.  She ignored him. She ignored my Aunt. She ignored me. She collected her clean clothes and her body wash and marched over the bathroom.  \u201cThere\u2019s no shower in there,\u201d I reminded her, as she silently closed the door and locked it behind her. We listened to her behind the closed door as she scrubbed herself with wet paper towels for the next 5 minutes. Then, she came out in her pajamas and plopped down on her hospital bed. She put her legs up and got out her favorite smelling bubble bath\u2026and began applying it as lotion. \u201cMom-that\u2019s not lotion. See here? It says bubble bath,\u201d I told her. She ignored me and continued rubbing in her bubble bath. I chuckled and let her go about her business. What could it hurt? When she was finished, she looked up and said, \u201cDo you think I should put on my make-up now or in the morning?\u201d For the first time in the 7 hours I had been there, I was able to sit back and relax. It appeared that mom had accepted her fate of staying in the hospital for one more night. I\u2019m wondering how it\u2019s going to blow over after her surgery today if they tell her she has to stay just one more night.   ",

        "content": "I\u2019m writing this fast, as I\u2019m short on time, but I wanted to give an update on my mom. This is an extremely condensed version. Please forgive me that my writing is not at it\u2019s best ;) Last Thursday, I left with my hubby and kids to meet up with my twin brother (and his family) at Lake Mead for a long weekend of fun. I felt nervous about leaving mom because she still wasn\u2019t eating. By Thursday night, she was throwing everything up again. I talked to my dad Friday morning and he said he was taking her into Urgent Care, again. After spending all day in Urgent Care and undergoing some tests, they found that a number with her liver was way too high (sorry, I don\u2019t know all of the medical terminology-I wasn\u2019t there). They then did an ultrasound and found a blockage in her bile duct which meant she had a gallstone. This blockage is the reason why she cannot hold anything down and why she has been throwing everything up. They admitted her to the hospital (Friday night) and said they\u2019d do more tests on Saturday to get a more clear picture and determine their next step, which would be either removing the gallstone or removing the gall bladder (this is what they told my dad). Saturday came and they took her out in the afternoon to do a few tests. Upon returning her to her room, they gave my dad no further information. When he finally asked, they told him that the attending doctor would be by that evening to speak with him. Dad waited until 9:30 pm and no doctor ever came by. He also ordered mom some soup from the cafeteria around 7:00 pm and it never arrived. Dad went home feeling frustrated and not really sure what was going on. When he arrived back at the hospital early Sunday morning, he was told the doctor had already made her rounds. He asked if the doctor would call him and he was told she would. He also gave mom an Ensure, as she had been asking for something and nothing had ever arrived from the cafeteria. The nurses gave my dad no instructions on what she could or could not eat (the communication with this hospital has been lacking, to say the least), so he figured he\u2019d make her happy and give her the drink and if the nurses had a problem with that then maybe it would be a lesson of communication for them. My dad waited\u2026and waited\u2026and waited for the doctor to call. My mother-in-law, who is the President of Volunteer Board at the hospital, got wind (from me) about what was going on and she put in a heated phone call to the charge nurse. The nurse told her that the doctor was on the phone with my dad \u201cas we speak\u201d, which turned out to be a lie. However, the doctor finally did call a couple hours later for the first time throughout mom\u2019s stay-after the doctor who would be removing the gall stone came in and explained the whole procedure to my dad. She (the attending doctor) was a day late and a dollar short. They sent mom in for an MRI Sunday afternoon and the doctor who was removing the gall stone told dad that the procedure would take place likely sometime on Monday and that it was up to the surgeon to decide, after looking at the MRI, if she would need her gall bladder removed. Yesterday, as we were driving home from the lake, mom went in to have the gall stone removed. They never gave a time or anything for when it would be done; it was just a spur-of-the-moment \u201cokay we\u2019re going to take her in now.\u201d My sister (who was with mom) called my dad, who was finishing up on a job, to come and he rushed over, only to wait a couple more hours for them to finally take her in. By the time I arrived at the hospital (around 4 pm) she was back in her room and confused at whether or not they had taken her out to do surgery. Try as we might to explain it to her, mom could not understand what had gone on. Furthermore, they hadn\u2019t said a word to dad when they dropped her off about what was going on. We finally called a nurse in, who was under the impression that mom would be going home now that the stone was removed. My dad told her that the operating doctor had said the surgeon was supposed to look at the MRI (taken the day before) to determine if the gall bladder needed to come out. The nurse went to make a phone call for clarification to both the doctor and the surgeon and confirmed that the surgeon would \u201cdefinitely\u201d be by that evening to check on mom and make a decision on her gall bladder. She also put a call in to the attending doctor so she could fill dad in on the details (I think there was a little confusion about that\u2026we were hoping to speak to the surgeon himself to know if he would, in fact, be coming to the hospital). The attending doctor eventually called dad and made it very clear to him that she did not have time to come by and check on mom. I don\u2019t know what the point of her phone call was; she gave no useful information and she has been absolutely useless throughout mom\u2019s stay (not to mention she has had a very witchy attitude with dad). They are paying her for nothing. We waited\u2026and waited\u2026and waited for the surgeon to come by and let us know what the heck was going on. If mom did not need the surgery, she would be free to go home. Mom was getting very restless and couldn\u2019t understand why they were making her stay.  \u201cI don\u2019t think these people here are being very supportive of me and helping me. I want to go home please\u2026your sister was here earlier and wasn\u2019t being so supportive of taking me home so please your dad and you can take me home now, please, I want to go.\u201d Over and over mom asked what time we were leaving and demanding that we take her home. My sister had also reported to me (earlier that morning) that mom had already taken her IV out 3 times over the past 2 days; the poor dear is tired and restless and wants to be home in her comfort zone.  The nurse put in a call to the surgeon that we were waiting to talk to him and again reassured us that he would be by. By 9:00 pm the surgeon still hadn\u2019t come and I headed home. I felt bad for leaving when she was so hopeful that I would be the one to save her and rescue her from the hospital. I called my dad this morning and he related to me that the surgeon finally called him THIS MORNING to affirm that he would indeed be removing her gall bladder. He claims that he had no knowledge that our family was waiting to speak to him and also claimed to have an emergency today; therefore, he cannot perform the operation today but rather, mom has to stay ANOTHER night and wait until tomorrow to have her gall bladder removed. My Aunt is with my mom now and has been texting me that she is very upset this morning. I will be heading over shortly and maybe I can distract her. Although I am not hopeful. It was a bit nerve racking being away while all of this was going on. Not that I could have done anything to help her\u2026but just being away while she was going through all of this was hard. I had fun with my family, but mom was constantly on my mind and I was constantly nagging my dad and sister for updates. My sister and my dad did a great job taking care of her, making sure someone was always with her, and my sister has done an excellent job keeping my family and me informed of everything going on. I know she was in good hands. But I can\u2019t help feeling guilty being away. We have another weekend trip planned for the holiday to visit my twin in Arizona and pick up a couple of my kids (who went home with him). And again, I question myself for leaving. I know there are others who can step in; I am not, by any means, irreplaceable. But I just feel guilty being away when she\u2019s going through this. Thank goodness for family and for friends and for the good people at church who fill in and help take care of my mom.  Hopefully, once her gall bladder is out, and she begins her healing process, this will resolve most of her stomach issues and we can get her eating again!!!  ",

        "content": "I wasn\u2019t ready for this stage quite yet. I\u2019ve tried to prepare myself for our future with dementia by educating myself on the disease. I have read books. I have gone to support groups. I network with others online. I think, for most part, I know what to expect. Yet I did not expect to have this issue at this phase in the game. I thought this part wouldn\u2019t come until the end. That\u2019s usually when a person refuses to eat. Or, at least, that\u2019s what I thought. I know that mom could pass through many phases in this diseases. I\u2019ve read about others who regress back to toddlerhood and infancy, putting non-food objects in their mouth, getting into things they shouldn\u2019t be touching. I know many caregivers have to \u201cchildproof\u201d their living spaces to keep their loved one safe. Most, if not all, lose the ability to toilet themselves, shower themselves or take care of any hygiene for that matter. Towards the end phases, many have trouble walking, talking (some lose language completely), and many develop problems swallowing and lose the ability to eat.  Mom hasn\u2019t passed through any of these phases yet. She still takes care of her own hygiene. She toilets and showers herself. She puts on a face of make-up and attempts to curl her hair everyday (though not quite like she used to). Aside from hiding car keys, medicines and credit cards, we haven\u2019t had to childproof anything from mom. I thought she would have to pass through all of these phases before she struggled with the eating phase. I expected it. I guess it\u2019s true what they say. No two cases of dementia are exactly alike. Over the past couple of months, mom has altered her diet once again. One thing always remains the same, and that is her morning Slim Fast. [Although one minor modification to that is that sometimes she will skip it in the morning now and drink it for lunch instead]. A typical day consists of: Slim Fast in the morning, a sandwich for lunch (with turkey, tomato, sliced American cheese, mayo and lots of sandwich oil), occasionally fruit (strawberries or canned pineapple) or Poppycock for an afternoon snack, and an Ensure for dinner. If we are lucky, she might go out to dinner with us but that has almost become non-existent as well. We can\u2019t even get her to go out to her favorite restaurant (Miguel\u2019s) anymore!  In the past week, the only solid food mom has eaten is some strawberries (twice) and 1 1/2 or 2 sandwiches; this is total for the entire week. She might have tried to eat a handful of Poppycock popcorn once or twice. Half of that food was thrown up. She drinks her Slim Fast everyday, once a day, and drinks a small can of Ensure most nights for dinner. Half of that has been thrown up as well. She only drinks water (about 6-8 oz) when she takes her medication, 3 times a day (as far as I\u2019ve noticed). Try as we might, we cannot get her to eat anything. We\u2019ve tried soups, Gatorade, popsicles, lemon-ginger tea, breads, toast...we\u2019ve even offered to take her shopping to pick out what she thought would sit well in her stomach. It\u2019s no use. Mom has it in her head that if she eats, she will throw up. And when mom has something in her head, you cannot convince her otherwise. My dad took her to a follow-up appointment with the doctor yesterday\u2026if that did any good. All they did was order more lab work and give her more medicine: one medication to prevent her from throwing up, and one medication to help increase her appetite.  My dad is willing to do anything at this point to get her to eat, including to try this medication. I suppose it is worth a shot, but I\u2019m a bit more hesitant-with good reason. With mom\u2019s disease, the body loses it\u2019s ability to make sense of bodily functions and signals. For example, mom cannot understand why her eyes water all the time; she thinks she\u2019s \u201cso weird\u201d when she burps or yawns or if her stomach makes noises. She doesn\u2019t understand these things anymore or what these functions represent. Along with this, they (those with semantic dementia) lose the sense of knowing when they are hungry or full. I firmly believe that mom\u2019s ability to decode hunger is lost. I think a part of her stomach pains could actually be attributed to hunger pain. But she doesn\u2019t recognize it as such. Instead of eating and ending the hunger pains, she skips meals because she\u2019s afraid of upsetting her stomach.  If my hypothesis is correct, wouldn\u2019t it be logical, then, to say that this medication will only worsen her stomach problems? Mom now weighs in at 126 pounds. That means she has lost another 14 pounds in the past 5 months and I would say most of that has been in the past 2 months. If this drastic change in her eating continues, at what point will the doctors do more than just prescribe a pill? I\u2019m not sure what this means for the future. Is it just a phase? Will she eventually start to eat again? Or has she taken a drastic turn?   ",

        "content": "Mom has been having stomach issues for quite some time now. She will go days, and even weeks, with little problem and then suddenly a stomach \u201cattack\u201d comes on. Lately, these episodes are becoming closer together. An episode usually starts in the evening or in the middle of the night. Usually. Mom starts to feel \u201csevere\u201d and in no time she is hovering over her small wastebasket at her bedside, gagging and throwing up phlegm and liquid. By the next day, she refuses to eat because she is afraid that if she does, it will upset her stomach and she will throw up again. So it continues for a few days: mom, throwing up while taking her usual medicines and refusing to eat. I believe it\u2019s a cycle. Mom\u2019s stomach is upset. Mom throws up. Mom refuses to eat which makes her stomach even more upset causing her to become nauseous and eventually throw up again. The part that is unclear is why she is getting sick in the first place. We\u2019ve brainstormed many ideas: maybe she\u2019s developed a lactose intolerance (we switched her milk to almond milk, unbeknownst to her) or maybe she\u2019s eating spoiled food (this could still be a possibility, but we try our hardest to keep up on cleaning out the fridge). We have taken her to a specialist (the \u201cstomach doctor\u201d) who has done ultrasounds and CT scans. Nothing shows up. Yesterday, dad had another appointment with this doctor to follow up with past issues and again, he said that there was nothing obvious that was showing up that could be a source for her sickness. He recommended that they put mom under anesthesia and do some sort of exploratory procedure to see if anything else can be seen. Dad told him that he would consider it, but hasn\u2019t made a decision on whether or not to put mom through this.  There are pros and cons to the procedure. The pro would be that we could possibly find a cause for her stomach issues. The cons are many: how will mom do under anesthesia? Could it cause further complications with mom\u2019s condition or could it \u201cpush along\u201d the disease process? If they do find something-say, maybe cancer-what good would that knowledge do [I know this sounds horrible, but if indeed they did find cancer would it be worth putting mom through chemo in her condition and with the quality of life that she has to look forward to?] These are all things to consider. The biggest question remains: if we put her through this test, are they actually going to find something or is a lot of this in mom\u2019s head? With semantic dementia, hypochondria is a big problem. This was explained to me at our last visit with UCLA, that with this form of dementia, their mind is losing memory/recognition of what certain bodily functions mean. For example, mom\u2019s stomach may growl or hurt because she is hungry, yet she doesn\u2019t understand that what she is feeling is related to hunger; she becomes confused with what she is feeling. Because of this lack of recognition, they become preoccupied with and fixated on every sensation they feel. Could it be that mom is simply hungry but cannot recognize the hunger pain? Rather than eating and putting an end to the hunger pains, mom starves herself for days, only occasionally drinking Slim Fast, Ensure or water, all the while continuing to take her medications. It becomes a cycle: not eating, feeling sick, not eating because she feels sick, feeling more sick because she\u2019s not eating.  Within the past 2-3 months, mom\u2019s eating habits have significantly worsened. She hardly eats (which could explain her increase in stomach problems). She\u2019s losing more weight. She drinks Slim Fast for breakfast, Ensure most nights for dinner and eats only a sandwich at lunch time. Sometimes she will snack on fruit or Poppycock in the afternoon. I know that when I do not get enough to eat, I sure don\u2019t feel good! Despite our efforts in getting her eat, she keeps herself on a mostly liquid diet. She doesn\u2019t recognize most foods anymore (the other day she didn\u2019t even know what chicken tacos were\u2026and that was one of her \u2018staple\u2019 foods only a few months ago!) and when we try to convince her to eat something we\u2019ve made, she protests, \u201cNo, different things now upset my stomach, no. I don\u2019t know how that will make my stomach feel.\u201d I have tried telling her over and over and OVER that her stomach upset is likely due to her medication with her liquid diet. She will hear nothing about it. No amount of coaxing or explaining will convince her. We have tried everything we can think of. We are at a loss of what to do. :(  ",

        "content": "For the past 2 years, mom has wanted Disneyland tickets for her birthday. Last year, my siblings and I bought both her and dad tickets to go. She went and had a good time, but was tired by late afternoon/early evening. But from what I remember, she went on quite a few rides and reminisced about her earlier days at the popular amusement park. This year, as her birthday approached, mom kept no mystery as to what she wanted for her gift. \u201cAnd last year how you got me those tickets to go to Disneyland, I want to have those again so will you buy them for me too please?\u201d (When she asks questions such as these, they generally sound more like demands than questions, ha ha). Of course I wanted to make all of her dreams come true. But the reality is, my dad is the one who would have to take her. I wanted to make sure he was up to it. The nice guy that he is, he said that he had already been considering taking her. Mom\u2019s birthday was in May, and I told her I was sending her to Disneyland for her birthday gift. Every time I\u2019ve seen her since, she asks me where her ticket is and laments, \u201cI just don\u2019t know why your dad won\u2019t take me yet.\u201d [Side note: dad has been really busy running his business]. This week, dad was in between jobs and decided he\u2019d take mom to Disneyland. When I asked him how it went, he told me he would write down his story and email to me (and my siblings). I asked him if I could share this on my blog. He was hesitant at first, but I was able to talk him into it ;) I think it\u2019s good for my readers to sometimes see things in the perspective of other members of my family, especially my dad. Some parts are a little sad and some parts will make you laugh out loud. So here it is; thank you, dad, for opening up and letting me share this.  \u201cMom got a ticket for California Adventure from Cassandra last month for her birthday. For the last month she's been like a child \"when can we go\", \"It'll be good exercise for me too\" \"being active I won't even need to take a nap\". Finally the day came when I could take her. I got up at my usual time, took care of some things, then woke her at 730. We had issues about taking the purse vs. taking the buttpack, as she would normally do. She wanted to take everything, finally consolidating to the buttpack; I gave in on taking the three full pill bottles. We left at 8:45, I got a little turned around in Anahiem, mom kept trying to be the navigator, \"you're not going the correct way\".......Blah, blah blah. We arrived at the Woody parking lot, very unfamiliar territory for her. She was very insistent that I wasn't at the right place. We took the shuttle, got to the gate by 10. She wasn't too keen on opening the pack and letting security have a look, but we finally got into California Adventure and started walking around.  \"This isn't looking correctly to me, No, No this isn't the right state, this isn't right.\" We walked around finally got on the white water raft ride. She got wet, protesting loudly how unhappy it made her. We walked around for about an hour. She couldn't find the \"severe rides\" she remembered. She wanted to be at Disneyland, So I go to customer services, explain the situation, 15 minutes later we're in Disneyland. We went on Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted House and walked around looking for the \"severe ride\" which I think she was thinking Big Thunder Mountain, which was closed and fenced off so it was mostly out of view. Lunch time, medicine, walking around more, nothing seemed to interest her, not shopping, not any of the rides. We went to see about space mountain,(not that she would've gone on it) but even fast pass was three hours out. She seemed to enjoy Michael Jackson at Captain EO. Nothing else interested her so by 3:00 we were heading out. While at California Adventure, nature called, so I hunted down the nearest restroom, told mom \"wait right here\" so I go in standing at the urinal checking out the tile work when I hear \"So this is the men\u2019s bathroom too?\" Horrified I turned to find none other than mom standing there wringing her hands together as she does. It's amazing how many thoughts shot through my head at once.....well at least they have partitions....I quickly looked to see how many of the dozen or so people noticed a woman in there....I wanted to be mad, but simply told her \"you can't be in here go wait outside please.....I remembered Rod Steward\u2019s line from Every Picture Tells a Story \"make the best time out of bad , just laugh it off\" So I did. Looking back, it was quite humorous. She has such an innocence about her.  I feel bad for her that she wasn't fully able to enjoy her long anticipated trip, but I don't know how much she realizes the difference, between what is and what used to be. She seemed content to have spent such a short time there.\u201d  ",

        "content": "This is a somewhat of a hard post to write, because it is so personal for me. But in sharing the journey of dementia, I think it is a very essential post to write and share with others who are on a similar journey. Around the holiday season (Thanksgiving and Christmas), I started to feel very down and even depressed. I think a big part of it was the time of year, and not having mom \u201cthere\u201d throughout the season. I felt a sense of loneliness in my Christmas baking and holiday planning. I found myself just wishing and waiting for the holidays to finally be over. For those who know me, you know that this is not typical for me. At all. I LOVE the holidays and everything they have to offer: traditions, festivities, music\u2026 By the end of December, I knew that I needed to do something about my situation. I found myself on the verge of tears nearly everyday over seemingly little things: I didn\u2019t have enough butter to make the batch of cookies I wanted to bake or I couldn\u2019t find the kids shoes as I was rushing to get them off for school in the morning. I couldn\u2019t vocalize what I was feeling because if I did, I knew I would break down. Nobody likes a cry baby. I\u2019ve been taking my step-daughter and my adopted daughter (formerly a niece) to therapy for a few years now, just to help them to overcome some of the obstacles they\u2019ve faced in their short lives and to have a safe place to express how they are feeling. I knew that it was probably time to see a therapist myself. I fought it for quite some time. I was worried about having a stigma attached to me for having to see a shrink. I didn\u2019t want them to push medications as a solution for how I was feeling. I told myself that this was a mind-over-matter kind of situation\u2026I just needed to be stronger. But try as I might, I just couldn\u2019t shake off the sadness that hung over me like a dark cloud. By January, I finally picked up the phone and made myself an appointment to see a therapist. I told them I wanted someone who specialized in grief counseling, and they set me up for an appointment the next week [I will refer to her as Dr. K]. I kept this a secret; only my husband knew that I was going (and eventually one other person). I wasn\u2019t ready for anyone to know. I felt very anxious at my first meeting with Dr. K. As I sat in the waiting room, I almost felt like there was a target on me and that everyone was staring at me. I don\u2019t know why\u2026I certainly DO NOT think any less of anyone who needs to see a counselor. For some reason, when it came to myself, it was hard to admit that I needed help. The meeting went well. Dr. K was very sympathetic and very compassionate. I opened up and shared some of my deep feelings. She sat and listened thoughtfully, occasionally offering some words of wisdom and asking questions. The question that sticks out the most in my mind was, \u201cDo you ever let yourself have a good cry? I mean, just really let it out?\u201d  I sat back and thought about that for a minute. The answer was \u201cno\u201d. I knew that it was good to let it out sometimes. But I had been so focused on being strong that I realized I was suppressing all of my emotions and not giving them a release. We talked some more throughout that session about the importance of grieving and allowing myself to cry and \u201clet it all out\u201d. She told me how important it was to do some things for myself-get out for an evening by myself or with a friend or on a date night; allow myself to read a book or have a hobby. I struggle with this as I try to balance my load: my family, my marriage, my 5 children, my mom and my dad; the list goes on. Sometimes I feel guilty for taking time out and doing things for myself-it almost feels selfish. But what Dr. K helped me to realize is that it is not selfish to take time for myself, it is essential. Essential for my emotional well being and essential for my family (you know that saying\u2026if mom\u2019s not happy, nobody\u2019s happy!) I met with Dr. K a few more times until a new realization dawned on me: that I was going to be okay. I realized that when I let myself have a good cry, I don\u2019t feel as depressed. I realized that it\u2019s okay to let myself breathe. I can take time for myself and not feel guilty about it! Most of all, I realized that I have a strong network of people in my life that I can lean on for support. I realized that while I was paying Dr. K to listen to me (and don\u2019t get me wrong, sometimes that is necessary), I have a small group of people in my life who I feel safe with; who I can vent to, cry on, lean on and depend on to help get me through the hard times (and at no cost!). I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t realize that before! I guess it took talking to a complete stranger to figure it out. But I am grateful for those close friends and family members who love me unconditionally and allow me to be myself-rain or shine-and give me support on this journey. This road with mom is always going to be bumpy. It\u2019s always going to hurt. It\u2019s going to get harder before it gets easier. I know that and I am doing my best to prepare for that. And I am no longer afraid to let myself have a good cry (even if it is only in my closet! ;) ) I would say to any of my readers who struggle with the idea of seeing a therapist: give it a try. You may find that it helps you to keep some sanity and to learn some coping techniques. Or, you may discover that you\u2019ve had the tools you needed all along.   ",

        "content": "A couple of months ago, I began thinking about activities that I could do with my mom that would be meaningful and even stimulating for her. I came upon a set of books geared towards people with Alzheimer's and Dementia. The idea of these books is to provide activities for and improve communication with people who suffer from dementia. There are several different books to choose from, and I decided to give it a try and ordered the America book (as shown below).I chose this book with the idea that looking at the pictures from landmarks of America would spark some memory in mom and create some dialogue for us aside from the everyday topics of medications and aches and pains. Mom always loved to travel and had visited many of the places that were pictured in the book, so I figured this would be a good choice.Throughout each book, there are beautifully photographed pictures on one page and on the corresponding page there are interesting facts about the pictures, quotations, questions, etc. What I liked best about the book was that at the beginning of the book, there are guidelines to help you interact with the dementia person. They give helpful hints about communication, such as making eye contact when you talk, getting on their level, etc. They also give some great ideas on how to create dialogue by asking thought provoking questions and provide examples of such. I was very optimistic and enthusiastic about taking my new book over to mom and looking through it together.\"Mom, I got you something,\" I said, inviting her over to sit down next to me on the couch. After some coaxing to get her to sit next to me, I explained that I got a book for her that I'd like to look at together. I told her it had pictures of different places that she had visited and that I was excited to hear about her stories of those places. I opened it up to a page I knew she would remember.\"Do you remember when you went to New York and saw the Statue of Liberty?\" I asked, pointing to the large statue of Lady Liberty.Mom squinted her eyes and looked confused.\"No, I don't know about that.\"As I continued to explain New York, reminding her about the trip they had taken several years ago, and talked about the Statue of Liberty, something finally sparked in mom.\"We went to New York, yeah. What good thing we got to see was that place, that religious place [Palmyra], and that airplane place where people were killing people too but it was closed down too,\" she said, referring to Ground Zero (their trip to New York was right after 911 took place). She talked of some memories of New York but when asked again if she recognized the statue she gave me a blank look and sort of shook her head.I turned to the next page: The Grand Canyon. This was the first big family vacation I remember taking as a child-to the Grand Canyon and up through Zion and Utah. Mom did not recognized the picture on the page, but eventually after describing what and where the Grand Canyon was, she brought up memories of visiting there with her older brother as a child.\"I don't recall taking you to Arizona. Trying to remember where Arizona is. My brother took me as a kid, my brother Mike took me too and we took a fun thing too and that, that ani-animal place thing too, there's one in Utah too. Am I correct in saying animal?\"I struggled to understand exactly what she was talking about, but finally figured that she must be talking about a dinosaur park (there's a dinosaur museum in Utah that she talks about every so often, which she visited on a vacation with my sister's family). And she must have taken some sort of ride around the park on a train or something. (I'm sure my Uncle will help recall this memory in the comment section ;) I was a little sad that she couldn't remember taking her children here on vacation. It seems that the earliest memories are the ones she remembers the most clearly.A few years ago, mom and dad went on another vacation to New York and visited Niagara Falls. My brother and his girlfriend at the time (now wife) met up with them and it was mom's first time meeting Natalie. It was a vacation that she absolutely loved and Niagara Falls was a place she had always wanted to go and see. I thought for sure she would remember the picture of the beautiful cascading waterfall.\"It says Canada,\" she said, reading the caption on the next page over. \"I don't know about Canada.\"Try as I might, mom could not recall Niagara Falls. It was apparent, at this point, that mom's attention was dwindling. Between each page, she would try to change the subject to her doctor or her medication but each time, I tried to bring her back to focus. I was determined to talk about something else and maybe, just maybe, find some kind of connection with my mom again.Turning to the page of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, mom says,\"Where is San Francisco?\"I explained to her that it was up north, near San Jose which was where we went EVERY SINGLE Easter of my childhood to visit my Aunt and cousins for the holiday. Eventually, mom remarks,\"Oh, I went many years ago, we went to a bridge thing too and that's when I could still be a driver. I'm still young enough to be a driver.\" And with that, mom became side tracked and went on her rant about driving.I tried to reel her back in and showed her the picture of Mt. Rushmore, explaning the history behind it. Mom abruptly stood up, walked over to a box of tissues, wiping her nose, and said,\"Hmph. Wonder why my nose is bleeding so red.\" (On a side note, I did not see any red blood at all).I tried again to bring her back over to finish looking at the book. But mom walked right past me as if I wasn't even there and walked out the front door, mumbling something about the mail being there. After a couple of minutes, she came back in sat down beside me to sort through her mail. She glanced over at me, and the book on my lap, gave me a glare and snapped,\"I don't care to look at that stuff.\" She got up and walked away to her computer.I was a little bit disappointed that more of a connection and dialogue wasn't made with mom, especially because these books are geared towards people with dementia. However...there are a couple of things I realized during that session.#1. However slight it was, mom DID remember some things and was able to (somewhat) communicate her memories.#2. Mom's form of dementia is very different from Alzheimer's. It is, in fact, one of the rarest forms of dementia out there. I am sure these books are great for people with other forms of dementia, but with mom's form her semantic memory is affected. This type of memory is responsible for giving meanings to what symbols (visual) and words (auditory) represent. She is unable to identify memories of specific places simply by telling her the name of the place or showing her a picture. We have to dig a little deeper to reach those memories.Perhaps taking a different approach would be helpful the next time around in showing her a book. Rather than making memories the focus, I will simply talk about the beauty of the pictures and try to get some dialogue on what she thinks or how she feels about it.For my readers who have a loved one with dementia, you can find these books on Amazon. I am very curious to hear about others' experiences with these books. So if you do decide to order, let me know how it goes ;) I've attached the direct links here: You can also visit the companies website directly: ",

        "content": "Happy Monday everyone! I've been away for the past week...my computer had a virus. Ugh! Finally got it all worked out.Last week was mom's second week with a caregiver. She had Teresa come in on Wednesday and a new lady, I think her name was Christina, came in on Friday. I didn't meet Christina, it was kind of a last minute notification that they were sending someone out that morning. So my sister (also named Christina) met her that morning.I was a little concerned that mom would not open the door for Teresa on Wednesday morning. So I called Teresa that morning to let her know that if mom did not answer she should give me a call and I would come over to let her in. I never received a call; I took that as a good sign that mom had opened the door.I called mom later on in the day to see how it went with Teresa. After telling me, yet again, how she felt about having people over at her house with her (\"I told your dad 'no' but he still said she had to come, I don't know why she needs to be here...\"), mom finally perked up as she told me how \"that girl\" went for a walk with her.\"She really wanted to go for a walk too, but I don't know why she couldn't drive me so she walked with me to Kmart too and I got some of that really good laundry soap stuff too. And she says she visits other people too, that's her job, visiting people,\" she says, with amazement and awe in her voice.I asked her some more questions about their visit and overall, mom seemed cheery about the whole experience. \"She helped with some of your dad's laundry too and wash a couple dishes too...she's a nice girl too...\" mom continued.Aside from the fact that mom just plain doesn't want anyone over there, she seems to do well while they are there. She gets aggravated when people are around, I think because she feels like she can't do her own thing (like run and hide in the office to play computer games, or nap in complete and utter peace and quiet), but I think deep down she likes having people there to visit with.  On Friday, I asked mom how she liked the new caregiver who came that day. Mom was elated to tell me that Christina let her make her her favorite sandwich: sliced turkey, American sliced cheese, sliced tomato, all layered on potato bread and smothered in mayo, mustard and submarine dressing. Mom always asks me I would like to have one her famous sandwiches because \"it's so delicious and nutritious for my body.\" Well, mom was finally able to bond-this time with Christina-over their delicious sandwiches.Today was my day to spend with mom. I've been trying to help my dad with some organization projects while I'm there, and mom is becoming increasingly resentful towards me for staying during her naptime. I feel like I'm pretty quiet, as are my boys (one naps and the other settles in with a movie during naptime), but if we are breathing then we are too loud for mom. She is fine during the rest of our visit, but the past couple of weeks (especially last week) she was very cranky with me when I left.\"I don't want you people here anymore! You don't support me and you're too noisy while I'm trying to sleep! You don't need to be here, no!\"I know better than to get offended; sometimes I question if I should really stay during her nap. But then I remind myself that I cannot give in to my toddler when he throws tantrums; it's no different for mom. Similarly, I sometimes wonder if we're jumping the gun and pushing a caregiver on her before there's a real need for it. But with the safety concerns we've had, I know that there's no better time to get started than the present. It helps relieve some stress and worry off my dad as well, both to have someone there to supervise mom as well as having people there to help with the housekeeping. She has been getting used to having people there, little by little, over the past several months. She may throw tantrums about it, but hopefully someday the tantrums will subside! ",

        "content": "Over the past several months I have been in contact with the Alzheimer's Association. I have only good things to say about them. In this difficult journey, they were one of the few people that we have come across that I have felt really care about our situation and are trying to help us find some relief to our dilemmas. I had called them several months ago about resources for support groups in my area. About a month later, a woman called me back just to check in and see if the resources they gave were helpful. As we talked more, the issue came up about our dilemma with a caregiver. We were having some concerns about mom being left alone all day long and the main issue with hiring a caregiver is the cost. After a couple months of working with us, including a home evaluation, it was determined that we are eligible to receive some assistance with a program they have for respite care. It's only for a couple of months (and then I suppose we'll have another evaluation to see if we can stay on the program) and it only offers 30 hours a month, but that is perfect for our needs at this time. As it is, I go over on Mondays, my Aunt and Uncle go over on Tuesdays, and another Aunt goes over on Thursdays. This leaves Wednesdays and Friday open for mom to cause trouble with nobody around ;)Today was our first day with a caregiver. Teresa is scheduled to come for a few hours on Wednesdays-mostly to supervise and make sure mom is safe. She will also do some light cleaning and cooking if we need her to. My dad tried explaining the idea of a caregiver to mom. She, as expected, was very resistant.\"No, I don't need anyone over here, no. I don't know why you want anyone here, no. I'm fine, I don't need help.\"Dad asked if I would be available to go over this morning to be there when the new caregiver arrived and help mom settle in to her new routine. I told him of course, I would be there.I arrived to mom's house a little before 10:00 am to talk to mom and remind her what was going on for the day. As usual, when I got there mom was locked away in her room. I knocked on her bedroom door and she didn't respond. I put my ear to the door and heard the shower running, so I gave her a few minutes to finish getting cleaned up. Just before 10:00 am, Teresa (the caregiver) rang the bell and she came inside the house as we made introductions. I liked her right away-and not just because she's Portuguese (turns out her mom has the same maiden name as mine...I knew it as soon as she pronounced our family name in the proper Portuguese language, which nobody has ever done before! We connected instantly ;)) Right away I could tell that she was a kind and caring person, as I was further able to see in her interaction with mom. After talking for a few minutes with Teresa and giving her some background on mom, I excused myself to go check on my mom. I walked down the hall and knocked on her door. No answer. I knocked several times and called her name loudly. Still no answer. After several minutes of this, I decided I should get the bedroom key and make sure that she was okay in there. I fumbled through a set of keys, trying each one until finally one key unlocked the door. I turned the knob and called mom's name as I went in, announcing my entry into her bedroom. I found her poking her head out of the wooden, sliding bathroom door, towel wrapped around her hair, as she stared at me.\"What? Don't come here, I'm naked. Do you want to see my weird, different body?\" she said, emerging from the bathroom, wrapped in a towel.\"It's okay, I'm not looking mom,\" I said, turning my direction away from her so that she would know I was NOT interested in seeing her in the nude.\"I just wanted to let you know that someone is here to see you,\" I told her.\"Oh I wanted to show you something too...\" Mom rushed over to her bathroom counter and pulled out 2 boxes of Revlon hair dye. She wanted to know if the 2 colors she picked out were okay; Friday is hair dyeing day because it has to be done exactly every 8 weeks. Despite my efforts to talk to her about Teresa, mom was focused only on the hair dye and wasn't hearing a word I had to say. Finally, after about 5 minutes of rambling, I was able to get her attention. She narrowed her eyes at me and her demeanor changed instantly when she figured out what I was trying to say.\"No, I already told your dad last night, no. I don't want anybody over here. I don't understand why he thinks I need someone here, no. Tell her no. No.\"\"Mom, she's already here, she's not leaving yet. She's not leaving until 1:00.\"She continued to object, \"No. I'm not even ready for anything, no. I have other things to do too,\" she argued, trying to make herself seem busy as she picked a few things up off her bed.After a few minutes going back and forth, I finally told her,\"Mom, she is here now. Finish getting ready; do your hair and make-up and then come out and meet her and see what you think.\"And with that, I walked out of her room and left her to finish readying herself. About 20 minutes later, I heard her footsteps coming down the hall. She practically glared at Teresa, as Teresa said \"hi\" in a friendly voice and introduced herself. She held out her hand to shake mom's as mom stood there; she did not return the handshake. \"I already told my husband I don't need anybody over here. I don't know why you're here, I don't want anyone here. I like to be by myself sometimes in the day too,\" she protested.Without skipping a beat, Teresa said, \"Your hair looks so pretty. You look really nice, did you just finish your hair?\"Mom's frown quickly turned to a smile as she realized the compliment Teresa had given her.\"Oh, yeah. But I'm going to dye it on Friday,\" she said, glancing at herself in the mirror which hung right above the seat on the couch where Teresa sat. The two talked for a few minutes; Teresa asking her some questions and mom talking about whatever subject was on her mind, mostly about how funny and weird she looks now and how she used to think she was \"such a cuter young girl\". We got up and followed mom into the kitchen and Teresa asked her if she could make her something to eat. I quickly filled Teresa in on her eating schedule-mom wouldn't be ready to eat until 12:00.For the next hour, I stood by as Teresa and mom became familiar with one another. Mom talked about her usual topics; Teresa doesn't know any better (for now) and just listened with great interest. After Teresa complimented a picture of mom's parents, which was sitting atop an end table, mom took that as a cue and led Teresa down the hall to show her more pictures of her family. In no time, she was talking about her relatives who were Mormon pioneers. I was in the living room, but heard Teresa remark,\"My sister-in-law is Mormon.\"Mom didn't seem to hear. I rushed over to her, knowing a friendship was about to be forged, and tried to redirect mom's attention to what Teresa had just said.\"Mom, did you hear what she said? She said her sister-in-law is Mormon.\" I repeated this a few times, standing directly in front of mom's face and making eye contact. She finally caught on to my words and became excited at what I said. A connection had been made!\"It's really such a really good religion and there's such really good people there too. It's one of the best religions too and I was wondering if you would ever wanna be baptized too?\" she asked her at one point during the conversation. I stood by, shaking my head and laughing. Teresa was a great sport and did very well conversing with mom.After about an hour, I could see that mom was settling in and starting to feel more comfortable with Teresa. I figured, at that point, that it would be okay for me leave. Teresa reassured me that they would be fine and mom seemed fine with me leaving as well. I told her I loved her and that I would see her later.I called my mom later this afternoon, just as my dad had gotten home and asked mom about the day's events. I asked him how she felt about Teresa and he said that mom was quick to let him know that she doesn't need her there every week. She wants time to be alone and do her own thing (probably to play on the computer without someone looking over her shoulder) and she doesn't understand why she has to be there. I'm wondering how it went after I left (I suppose I'd have to call Teresa to find out the truth about that!) I envision my mom telling her that it's time for her to go because it's her naptime and not to bother coming back. Sorry mom, but I think Teresa's gonna be around for a while ;)",

        "content": "As mom's abilities have been declining, so has her ability to use the phone properly. Looking back, I can see it's been a gradual decline. It started with her not responding or becoming distracted while we were talking with her. For a time, she was answering the phone with aggravation in her voice, \"What?\" We had to prompt her to say good-bye at the end of our phone conversations. Most of these behaviors were before her diagnosis and we would get very irritated with her rudeness and lack of manners on the phone. It has only gotten worse since then, although rather than being irritated, we have accepted it as a part of her disease and try to find the humor in it instead.When answering the phone, she is often confused at who she is talking to; especially when it is a solicitor. That can actually be quite amusing to hear. She usually won't answer the phone if she doesn't recognize the phone on the Caller ID. A couple of months ago, a phone call went ignored when she didn't recognize the name \"Margarett Reid.\" Mom seemed to forget that my Aunt Peggy's 'real' name is Margarett (this is her sister-in-law).Lately, she doesn't answer the phone when I call. I would say that nearly 90% of my calls go to their answering machine (unless my dad is home, of course). I don't know if this is because she is not recognizing the ringing sound (although she will still answer on occasion) or if she is too engrossed in her computer games to hear the call or want to bother with it. Sometimes I will start to talk on the machine, \"Mom, it's me. Cassandra. Answer the phone.\"I'll wait a minute or so to see if she answers; she never does.I have to admit that many times when my mom leaves messages on my answering machine, I am chuckling by the end of the message. With this disease, you have to develop a sense of humor, or you will never survive. I get my daily dose of humor whenever I hear a voicemail from mom. Many times, she sounds so irritated that I'm not there; I just have to laugh (for some reason she thinks that, with 5 kids, I just sit at the home by the phone all day!) She never has a greeting or farewell-this goes for phone calls as well as messages. A couple of months ago, my dad went to Florida to help my brother move to Arizona and we were taking care of mom while he was gone. Mom got wind (from her sister Claudia) that we were planning to spend the night at her house and I came home from running some errands to hear a very angry message from my mom,\"Only mom,\" she took a short pause, \"just calling to tell you I don't want anyone spending the night here, that's what Claudia said. No! No!\" [Click]. I probably listened to that message 5 times, laughing so hard I nearly peed my pants. If you could hear the message, you'd understand why.Yesterday, my sister called me giggling and relating that she checked her voicemail to hear one sentence from my mom.\"Oh you're not home, I was hoping you could bless me.\" [click]We laughed together as I explained to my sister that mom had called me earlier that day as well. She wanted me to \"bless\" her by taking her to Wal-mart. When I told her I was in the middle of making dinner and had somewhere to be afterwards, she apparently called my sister.Today, I came home from the park to find another message from mom. \"Cassandra it's your mom because your dad said to tell you, uh to call, um, to make my head-headache, my headache med- I mean\" (there was a little bit of garble that I couldn't make sense of \"darn it, to make my haircut thing with that girl too...[a little more garble] have her phone number but not severely early or whatever but I don't know if she's there on Wednesday or not but I don't know but maybe you could call to find out to go tomorrow or Friday or I'd like to go quicklier on Saturday. I haven't gone for a haircut since November, I need one so do that please.\" [click] (On a side note, \"that girl\" is named Crystal and she's been doing her hair for about 20 years now). This message wasn't quite as funny as some in the past. She was clearly struggling to find the right words to communicate; she was stammering and stuttering and at some points it was hard to make out what she was saying. Hearing her struggle to communicate what she wanted made my heart a little sad.At some point I am sure she will lose the ability to use the phone altogether. I've seen a major decline just in the past few months. Of course this is a concern as it gets harder and harder to get ahold of her when we try to call. Sometimes I get a little worried when she doesn't answer since she still is home alone part of the time (we're working on arrangements for that). But...we just take it one day at a time!",

        "content": "I grew up in a family who expressed their patriotism to our country. Both of my grandfathers served in the military, as well as several Aunts and Uncles. Part of being patriotic is exercising your right to vote. My parents set that example for us from the time we were small kids and expressed the importance of voting. I remember both mom and dad going to the polls on election day, and returning proudly wearing their \"I Voted\" stickers.Today was the first time that I can ever remember that my mom has not participated in election day. She is not even aware that today IS election day. If you ask her who the President of the United States is, she will not have an answer for you. If you ask her who is running for President, she will not know. When shown pictures (at UCLA) of our President and pictures of some of the most famous past Presidents, mom did not recognize who they were.This comes as somewhat of a surprise to some, seeing how one of the candidates for President is a Mormon. One of my mom's obsessive behaviors of dementia is an obsession with her religion. One would think that she would be aware that someone of her faith is running for President. But mom is completely oblivious to it all.Mom has missed all of the media propaganda surrounding the election. She does not watch TV. She cannot comprehend what is on the screen, so she doesn't watch. The only time she gets on the internet is to check her email; even then, she has a difficult time sorting out junk from personal emails. In fact, I'm not even certain how often she checks her email these days. Needless to say, she hasn't been reading up on politics via internet. Nor does she read the newspaper or magazines anymore. She doesn't answer most phone calls, and when she does, she is very confused and cannot comprehend most of what people are saying to her over the phone. She does not engage in most conversations that we have when together as a family/group or one-on-one. She can only talk about what is on her mind. She cannot comprehend most of what we say. It is not surprising, then, that she is oblivous to what is going on in the world around her. The only world she lives in is her own, which is being ruled by dementia. She is rapidly losing her knowledge and awareness of everything around her. Dementia is a beast.",

        "content": "Yesterday, a link was shared on a dementia support facebook page which I belong to. I followed the link and read an article written by a woman about her mother's struggle with dementia. It was beautifully written and depicted some of the challenges and heartaches she's faced as her mother's caregiver.I scrolled down to read comments by other readers, most of whom agreed with the beauty of her writing as they shared some of their own struggles in dealing with this heartbreaking disease. One critic, however, had a different opinion after reading her article. He wrote, \"The writing was excellent but I was left with this horrible feeling of having invaded your mother's privacy. It's as if you allowed all these strangers to peer into your mother's most vulnerable, private moments. And to what end? To explain how you coped? Everyone copes in their own way...I know it's completely your decision to expose your mother in this way. But I wonder what she would think of this.\"This comment really bothered me and I thought about it all throughout the day. I suppose it's because I, too, have opened up in sharing our moments with my mother. It caused me to sit back and ponder, am I invading her most vulnerable, private moments? And \"to what end\" am I doing this? Am I wrong for opening up about this?I thought about it, long and hard. There is a part of me that wonders if I should be so candid and public about the journey are enduring. I tend to be a self-doubter, so I admit I felt a little guilt and doubt about what I am doing. As I continued to think (and maybe even fret a little bit) about it, several thoughts came to my mind to reassure me that this is what I should be doing.As this critic commented that strangers are viewing her mother's most private, vulnerable moments, I realized that I am not sharing every moment at all. What I share is really only the surface. There are far more behaviors and things that she does/says that I could write about, but I am using my discretion in what I post simply because some things are embarasssing to bring up. Truly, I am not writing about the craziness of my mom; I am writing about the alien that has taken over her body, the alien known as dementia.  I have only the best of intentions with this. That is what I want my readers to understand most of all. I am not writing about this for any personal gain. I am not writing about this to exploit my mom in any way. In many ways, this isn't even my mom that I am writing about. This is about a disease that has overtaken my mom. While yes, I write about her behaviors and her struggles, what people need to understand is that this is not my mom, at least not the \"Deana\" we all once knew and loved. While she might be embarassed if in her normal frame of mind over the things that have transpired, she is not in her normal frame of mind any longer and she has no control over herself. She is no longer accountable for her actions.THAT is what I am trying to teach people in sharing this journey. I want people to understand what this disease does. How many times do we encounter someone who is a bit \"cooky\" and do not know what to think or how to react? I want people to gain an understanding and empathy to those they encounter who suffer from this disease. I want to offer a place of support for those who are going through the same thing. And only they can understand what I mean by that; it's a difficult thing to go through and for most of us, it helps to read and share with others who are going through the same thing.Knowledge is power. We cannot learn if we do not share. If writing about this journey can help anyone at all in their own personal journey, then it is worth it to me to write. My mom is an educated woman, she has always enjoyed sharing her knowledge with others. I do feel that she would be proud, and not ashamed, of what I am doing. Maybe I'm off base here, but these are the thoughts that continue to come to me when I find myself contemplating the things I write. ",

        "content": "\"Oh, Jeff is home; why is Jeff home today and not working today?\"Yesterday was Labor Day. My parents came over late afternoon for our usual Labor Day barbeque. It was about 4:45 when they arrived; on a regular day, my husband doesn't usually get home from work until 5:30 and she very quickly noticed that he was home before his normal time (I think it's easy for her to remember what time he gets home as it is the same time as her dinnertime).\"Mom, today is Labor Day, remember??\"As I tried to remind my mom about the holiday that lands every first-weekend-of-September, my mom stared intently at the food she placed on the counter and quickly changed the subject, asking about the salad I made, and if it had \"tomatoes in it too\".Oddly enough, I had just read a post in my online support group that morning, talking about the very issue of a loved one (with dementia) forgetting what holidays and birthdays are. So far, my mom has an excellent memory of birthdays and anniversaries. Every so often she goes to the Dollar Tree to stock up on birthday and anniversary cards for the upcoming months, because \"they are such a good price, only a dollar!\" She will fill them out and place them by her bedside a month before the occassion, every day reminding herself and others that so-n-so's birthday is on such-n-such date and \"I even have a card to send her too.\" She loves to serenade us with song for our special days. Her favorite, which she recently admitted to me that she sings in her head at bedtime, is the Anniversary song (to the tune \"William Tell Overture\" by Rossini):\"Happy Anniversary, Happy Anniversary,Happy Anniversary,Haaaaaaa-ppy Anniversary!Happy Happy Happy Happy Happy Anniversary.....\" (and on, and on, and on...)Holidays are another issue. She remembers the big ones: Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter. I've noticed that she doesn't seem to remember the smaller holidays, such as Memorial Day or Labor Day. I remember this past Valentine's day...she was completely confused as to why my dad brought her flowers, \"Our anniversary isn't until February 28th.\"Even with an explanation, she couldn't seem to recall what Valentine's Day is. Little by little, she is forgetting the meanings of these significant days.With the holiday season drawing near, I feel a little bit of despair. Everything is changing, and it's changing fast. Last Christmas was so much different than the year before. What will this Christmas bring? Is this going to be the last year that she remembers what we are celebrating? I know that time is precious. None of us know how much time we have. I am realizing now, more than ever before in my life, how important it is to make the most of the time we have. I feel an urgency to make this holiday season spectacular, and to make as many memories as possible. ",

        "content": "When my mom was given the probable diagnosis in March, of semantic dementia, a hundred questions raced through my mind. Of course I wasn't going to wait until a follow-up appointment to learn about her disease; I began reading everything I could find on FTD and semantic dementia. Between March and now, she has had an MRI to confirm the diagnosis. I suppose this visit was a follow up to discuss the results of the MRI (although they had already confirmed over email that the findings were consistent with semantic dementia). Though I feel as if many of my questions have been answered over the past few months of research, I have still been anticipating this visit to UCLA. I guess sometimes it helps to hear the answers straight from the horse's mouth.I walked into the extremely cool, air-conditioned building of UCLA medical around 10:15 this morning. My dad was parking the car (we were running a tad bit late...good ol' LA traffic); he dropped us off in the front to get mom checked in while he parked. I don't know if it was the chilly air or my nerves, or maybe both, but my teeth would not stop chattering. Why was I so nervous? I knew what to expect, but coming face-to-face with reality was a bit overwhelming for me at that moment.I saw an older, short woman with short grayish hair approach the waiting room, her eyes searching for someone. I looked at her nametag that read \"Jill\" and knew she was looking for us (I've heard all about nurse-practitioner, Jill, since the last visit. I felt like I knew her already!) She finally recognized my mom and started to say hi just as I told her that we were the people she was searching for. My mom gave her a blank look.\"Hi Deana, do you remember me? I'm Jill, your nurse.\"My mom looked at her with a blank expression on her face for several seconds. She finally uttered an \"oh yeah\" as she began to remember her last visit.\"How was your drive?\" Jill asked my mom, remembering that the last drive out there had wreaked havoc in my mom's stomach, and consequently in the car and on her clothes.Wrong question. All mom heard was the word \"drive\".\"Driving? Oh yeah, I was really so sad the last time I came out here and you guys cancelled my driving even though I'm really a good driver. I was always a good driver, I don't know why you had to cancel me, I was really sad about that too...\"She went on for a good minute or two and Jill just gave me the \"uh-oh\" look as she realized she had just opened a can of worms. She tried to gently redirect her and change the subject. She finally told us to have a seat and wait a few more minutes while she checked to see if the doctor was ready.After a few minutes, we were called into the doctor's office with Jill, Dr. Mendez and another guy who wasn't introduced to us (I believe he was a neurology professor who was there for observation). Dr. Mendez reviewed some things with us from the past visit and asked my mom some questions. She had a difficult time understanding why she was there; she asked them to help her with her headache medicine and went on many tangents throughout the meeting about her driving situation. Dr. Mendez pulled out a big book that contained pictures of objects. The beginning pages were sketches of everyday items. He asked her if he knew what the items were for and what they were called. She identified that the sketch of the comb was for \"combing hair\", but couldn't name it as a comb. He showed her a sketch of a toothbrush.She stared hard at the picture and finally said, \"Hmph. It looks familiar\" and then shook her head.He showed her a picture of an octopus and asked her if she knew what it was. She didn't know. He showed her several more pictures of animals: a camel, a horse...I really can't remember what else because at some point I finally had to look away; my heart couldn't take it. Tears welled in my eyes as I watched my mother struggle with each answer (every answer was either \"I don't know\" or \"a dog\"). I took a deep breath, looked at the door of the room and told myself that I would not break down in front of these people.The next round of pictures was of celebrities: Ronald Reagan, Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, etc. She could not recall who one of those people were. My mom has always been a big classic movie fan. I remember watching many movies with her which featured Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe; she had no clue who they were. She kept asking \"How would I know these people?...\"are these people I know?\" and she would read the headline on the page: \"famous people\". She finally looked up at the doctor very suspiciously and said,\"This isn't you, is it?\" Then she glanced around the room, as if we were all tricking her. \"These aren't pictures of all of you people, is it?\" I have to admit we did get a few chuckles out of it, mom included. We assured her that none of our pictures were in the book.Dr. Mendez then showed us the results of the MRI. He explained the findings in the brain and how they were consistent with semantic dementia. In the picture of her brain was a dark circle. He explained that it was a hole in her brain. That part of her brain is disintegrating.Basically, semantic dementia is caused by a protein called TDP 43. This has only been discovered in 2006, so there is still a lot unknown in this particular form of dementia. From what I can conclude, it seems that this protein eats away at the lobes in the brain. There have been recent clinical trials of medicine to treat this disease; it was concluded as being ineffective. There is no treatment at this time. Based on the cognitive testing (and I'm guessing what he saw on the MRI), Dr. Mendez categorized her as \"moderately advanced\" in this process.Now for the good news. How can there be any good news in this??? What I really loved about Jill was that she wanted to focus on the positive. There is so much negative, and news like this is devastating. So she took time with us to point out the positives in our situation.#1. There is NO genetic link in semantic dementia. What a huge sigh of relief I breathed today. Most of the information I've read points to no genetic link, but there have been a couple things I've read that say there is a higher chance of carrying the gene for children of people with dementia. Jill reassured me not to waste any time worrying that this will happen to me or my siblings, kids, etc. Whew!#2. In my research, I've read over and over that the duration of this disease is generally 6-8 years. She says the duration is longer with semantic dementia. It is generally 12 years, but there is no definitive answer as it varies case by case. It could be longer, or it could be shorter. To be honest, I don't know if this is good news or not. I don't want my mom to suffer. For now I will view this as a positive because it means that we have more time left, to make memories, than I had originally anticipated.#3. Mom has a lot of obsessive behaviors. It doesn't seem like a positive, I know. But many dementia patients have safety issues (due to extremes in their behaviors), problems with hygeine, eating (weight loss), taking medicines, etc. Because my mom is obsessed with taking her medicines on time, sleeping for certain lengths of time, showering and \"decorating\" her hair and make-up, this works for our and her benefit. She does not have the problematic behaviors that so many others face. #4. Along with #3, the frontal parts of her lobes are not as damaged. That part of the brain is the part that focuses on behaviors. Though her behavior and personality has changed with this disease, it is not the same changes in behavior you will see when this part of the brain is damaged. When or if the damage spreads to this part of the brain, we may see more mean and aggressive behavior, outbursts, etc. #5. She is still classifying things in categories. For example, aside from the octopus, she still identified the animals as such. Even though she thought most of the pictures were of dogs, she still recognized that they were animals. She identifies food in the food category, even if she's not sure what the name of it is, and so on.Out of all the forms of semantic dementia, this is the most rare. Jill gave me some resources to find support for people with this specific disease, which I fully intend on utilizing. They will follow up with us every 6 months, to check on her progression and help us in whatever difficulties we face.After an hour and a half consulting with Jill and Dr. Mendez, we left UCLA. Our questions are answered...for now...until we think of new ones to ask. It wasn't all doom and gloom as I had expected. Yet I still find myself emotionally exhausted, as I try to sort everything out in my mind. Aside from my husband and my Aunt (who I'm very close to), I haven't talked about this with anybody. In fact, I've kind of been avoiding talking about it. I'm usually pretty open and don't mind talking. Today, I just needed my space to take it all in and process it. I find it easier to share through writing than by speaking. I wanted to write while it was fresh in my mind. And I needed to write for my own therapy today. I'm sure there is a lot of information I've forgotten to write in, but it's all I can manage for now.",

It read: \"Cassandra: helper of mankind.\" I remember her beaming and telling me how perfectly my name definition fit me.I was always my mom's helper. When she had an important job that needed to get done, she knew that she could ask me and I'd be there to help her out. Whether it was grocery shopping with her, baking all the Christmas goodies, running errands (once I had my license)...mom knew she could count on me.I remember her always telling me that I was an \"altruistic\" person. At the time, I had no idea what that big word meant. Now that I am older, and somewhat wiser, I know what it means to have altruism. I don't know if I truly fit that description, but I do know that I care deeply about other people.Mydadhas always been anamazing example of helping and serving others; I try to model myself after him. I lovethe feeling I have when I help another person. When I see people troubled with different issues, I like to try and be the friend that can help them solve their problems.Since my mom's diagnosis, I've been racking my brain trying to figure out how I can help to make this situation better. Nothing I can dowill make this disease go away; in that sense I am completely helpless. Yet there's been this nagging feeling that there is something for me to do, some role that I can and mustplay in all of this. There will come a time when she will need round-the-clock care. I want to be there to help with that. Realistically, I havemy ownhome and 5 children to take care of. How can I take on the role of caring for my mom without neglecting my family? I worry about the financial toll all of this will take on my dad. Not that he's a pauper...but in-home care is vey costly. What can a small person like me do to help in such agiant situation?And then it came to me. I can blog.Initially, I started this blog as a means of therapy for myself. I thenopened upby sharing it with thosefamily members and friends who are closest to me, to keep them up-to-date on mom's condition. Recently, I decided it was time to share it with anyone who was interested in reading; friends from church who have interacted with mom (and wondered about her strange behavior and memory loss), others who are dealing with the same heartache. More recently, I have expanded my thinking and seen a bigger picture. Something much bigger than myself, much bigger than just posting an update on my mom every few weeks . This vision started with a mere suggestion of a friend (my sister's friend, to be exact). After reading my blog, she told my sister that Iam \"a brilliant writer\" and suggested to her that people are able to get paid for their blogging. That's when the wheels in my head started turning. I don't know that I'm a \"brilliant\" writer. But what if I could transform my blog into something more? What if I could make this little blog of mine into a place where people can turn for answers? A place where people can read and learn about the journey of dementia through my experiences. A place where they can turn for support and additional resources to aid them in their own journey. And all the while, as I am able to (hopefully)help others in their journey, I can earn a little money to help fund the cost of my mom's care.I've seen the vision. I'm excited. I'm nervous. I'm eager. I'm afraid of failure. But I have the chance to do something. Over the next few weeks, my blog will be under construction as I try to bring this vision to life. Please be patient with me as I work out all the kinks. When the time comes, and I'm ready to move forward with this next step in our journey, I would love it if you all moved forward with me. Follow my blog. Tell your friends, tell your family. Tell others who are struggling with this same hardship. I need a large following to begin the next step of this process. Leave your feedback. I want to hear from you.There comes a time, in each of our lives, where things become hard. Sometimes the challenges we face become unbearable.We can choose to dwell on the negative, or we can try to makea positive out of the trialswe face. Losing my mom is hard. In fact, it is the biggest challenge I've had to face. I feel determined to do something positive. For my mom, I will tryto live up to my name.",

        "content": "Raising a toddler is a demanding job. Having three small children (my youngest being 14 months old) often leaves me drained, physically and emotionally. Having children means putting their needsahead of your own, but having a toddler means constant care and attention. From the minute my toddler wakes up in the morning, until the time he goes to bed at night, my day is centered around his routine and his needs. He doesn't yet talk, so he communicates to me with a mixture of babble, cries, whines, laughs and giggles, tantrums, and so on. He can't do much for himself; I spend my days dressing him, changing his diapers, bathing, preparing his food, wiping up messes, entertaining himand keeping him safe. His new favorite thing to do it is climb. I have to keep a watchful eye on him to make sure that he doesn't fall off the kitchen table or the playground outside. He's learning to walk but isn't as steady on his feet, so he gets a lot of bumps and bruises when he's navigating himself to where he wants to go.My house has been altered for my toddler. Childlocks secure every cupboard because without them he is pulling everything out and breaking dishes on the floor. We have to keep the doors closed-especially the bathroom door as he has a fascination with the toilet. Sharp and dangerous objects must be kept out of his reach. We have to be careful of the things that are left out in his view because anything small will make it into his mouth if he finds it. Sometimes, things go missing (the TV remote being the most popular) and we play a big guessing game trying to figure out what he has done with it. If we try to ask him what he did with the missing object, he might giggle, he might babble or just give us blank looks because he doesn't know what the heck we're talking about.When it comes to outings, they revolve around his nap schedule. He takes a morning nap and a later afternoon nap. Grocery shopping, errands, trips to the library, etc are worked around his sleeping schedule. Staying out late isn't an option because he has an early bedtime. When he doesn't get his sleep, he is cranky, whiney and has many meltdowns. He sleeps in a crib; if he weren't confined he would wake up and wander around the house and cause all kinds of trouble! Of course if my husband and I want a night out, we must hire a babysitter to take care of him while we are gone. Toddlers can't be left alone.Last week at support group, a book was recommended to me to read on behaviors of people with dementia. As I was researching that book (on Amazon), I stumbled upon another book called \"Dementia: The Journey Ahead\". It is a guide for caregivers of dementia patients, written by a woman who cared for her husband (who had Semantic Dementia). I ordered both books, opting for the 2 day shipping. I was anxious to read. The book arrived Friday afternoonand I had finished reading it by Saturday night. The conclusion I drew after reading the book is that my mom is becoming an adult sized toddler.It was hard to read about what is to come; necessary, but hard. I have had so many questions about what this disease will look like as it progresses. As it is now, my mom has very childlike behaviors. As the disease progresses, it will become more and more childlike. It is almost as if she is growing backwards and will eventually become like an infant again. The only difference is that unlike a child (or a baby), her body is forgetting how to function, rather than learning.Susan, the author of the book, prepared caregivers for what is to come by sharing experiences of her husband as well as by giving recommendations of where to turn for help on each given situation. In a nutshell, here are some major changes that we can expect in the future with mom:We can expect herto lose memory of everyone around her. I was holding onto the hope that she'd remember those who were closest to her. And it's still a possibility. But we have to prepare for the worst.We can expect that mom may become incontinent. This means that she will be in diapers. Again, I've heard that most dementia patients become this way but I was hoping there was a chance to skip that. It looks very unlikely that we will escape the inevitable.We can expect to childproof the house. Many dementia patients put small things in their mouths and eat whatever is in sight. It's hard to believe that this could happen to my dear mom, but it's something I hear over and over from other caregivers.Dementia patients become wanderers. We will have to keep tabs on her and make sure that doors are secured so she can't wander outside.We can expect temper tantrums, whining and crying and even take some beatings. Imagine a toddler tantrum but in an adult body. This is typical in dementia.Eventually, but not necessarily, she could become bed ridden. Each case is individual, so there's no telling one way or the other. But many become this way and end up in hospital beds. They sleep for many hours of the day, like newborn babies.Like I said, each person is different and no two cases are exact. However, this is the \"norm\" in dementia. From my reading, each case of dementia starts out different (depending on the form of dementia they have), but in the end most cases look alike. Bottom line: mom is going to need round the clock care in the near future.At the end of the book, there was a rating scale to determine which phase your loved one is in. There were several categories of behaviors and cognitive abilities to rate and the ratings were as follows:0: none.5: questionable1: mild2: moderate3: severeIn most categories, she scored a 1 or 2 (mild or moderate) which I interpret tomean that she fits the moderate category (or is at least transitioning into it). Now is the time to prepare for the next phase: severe.I don't know how we are going to get through this. I know we will, but I don't know how. Susan was fortunate enough to be able to quit her job to care for her husband full-time. And even then she had another part-time caregiver come in to assist her. There are facilities that house people (my dad would never send family to a home), there are daycare and in-home care options; all are very expensive. With my dad being self-employed, he doesn't have a steady income. It isn't feasible for him to quit work to take care of her full-time, as the bills still need to be paid. They are too young for retirement or Medi-care. Our best option is waiting to see what Social Security will offer her to financially relieve them of some of this burden. The current wait time on their case is 12-18 months. My dad would say this isn't for me to stress about. Yet the past few nights I have laid awake in bed feelingstressed about the future. I am stressed for my dad and what he is going through, and especially for what is to come. He can't do this alone.I have 5 kids ranging from 1 year to 16 years old; it is impossible for me to care for my mom everyday and manage my family and household at the same time. But I do know that I need to do something to help my dad (and my mom) get through this. I want to be there to help. Once again, I find myself trying to figure out my role in this difficult journey.",

        "content": "A couple of months ago, my best friend (of 23 years) and I reconnected on the phone. Although we had beenkeeping in touch through email and facebook, it had been quite a while since we had talked on the phone. We arranged a time beforehand to make sure that we wouldn't have interruptions and could \"catch up\" with one another. We both anticipated the call and thought about everything we would fill each other in on, which was quite a bit! It was a bit overwhelming to think of where to begin and cram in all the bits of informaion we wanted to share in a limited space of time. In a period offour hours, we tried to catch one another up to speed on the happenings of our current lives. Four hours sounds like a long time to talk on the phone, but when it was time to say good-bye, we both felt like we still had so much more to say! Isuppose that's what happens when you don'tcommunicate for a long time.Before we hung up, wepromised each other tohave phone calls weekly; that way we are better able to keep up on everything we want to share with one another. It's been almost two monthssince I've last blogged.Aswith theanticipated phone call with my friend, I feel overwhelmed onwhere to start.So many thoughts and events havetranspired in the past couple ofmonths.I could sit here for hours and recounteverything that has taken place: her trip to Montana to visit her brother, our family camping trip in the mountains, the updates on her driving and the progression of her disease. Mother's Day. Her birthday. But where do I begin? How can I possibly convey all the happenings and all of the emotions that have taken place over the course of the past couple of months in just one simple entry? Rather than try and eat a whole elephant, I will simply have tosnack on small pieces. Perhaps over time I can go back and try to finish the whole thing, but for now I will just take small bites and share what is in the forefront of mymind.One of the most significant things that has occured since my last entry is that I havejoined a caregivers support group. I found a group that meets a mile down the road, at a facility that houses people with dementia. It meets the 2nd and 4th Mondays of the month. The first meeting I went to (last month) was very intimidating. I tried to getmy dad and my sister to go with me; both were unable to attend. I hestitantly walked into the room, butterflies in my stomach, not quite sure what to expect. I knew it was a longshot, but deep down I was hoping to find someone there who had a loved one with the same form of dementia as my mom, someone who could relate to what I was saying and share some of their experiences with me. There is still so much that is unknown, and I suppose I fear the unknown. I want to know what to expect in the future. It has been hard to find much on Semantic Dementia when I research it (every place refers back to the same few links). Meeting someone with Semantic Dementia would be almost a relief for me, to know we're not alone and to prep for what's to come.Well, it was a long shot. There were three other caregivers who came to the group that morning, along with the director. When I said the words \"semantic dementia\" I was questioned on exactly what that is. Even the director, whose mother had Alzheimer's and whohas been involved in support groups for years (and whose husband is a neuropsychologist), was unfamiliar with the term (once I told her the nickname was \"Picks Disease\", however, she began to recall what she knew about the disease). I came to the group hoping for some sort of answers; instead, I was educating everyone else on this rare form of dementia. I will be honest, I felt a little discouraged in that moment. The director's unfamiliarity with it just affirmed to me exactly how uncommon this is. I realized that I had gone there searching for answers on her disease, and answers is not what I would be receiving from this group. But as we talked, what I began to realizewas that I had found a group of people whounderstand the hardship my family is facing. Though theform of dementia isdifferent, there are many similaritiesin every person who hassome form of it. I could relate to the things that they were sharing about their loved one, as they could with me. I felt an empathy from them that I haven't found with other people who I talk with about my mom. They understandexactly what I am feeling: the frustrations, the heartache, the loss. Because theyare feeling it too. That morning,I foundfour other allies who could relate to everything I have am going through. I am not alone; my family is not alone.Another thing I found with this support group was resources to help us in this process. They were able to give me good advice on obtaining Power of Attorney (and cautioned me to avoid Conservatorship at all costs-which was the route we had been thinking of taking). They told me exactly what my dad needed to do to obtain the Power of Attorney. We talked about daycare options versus homecare options versus assisted living care option. They gave me some additional resources and phone numbers to call for more information on the topic. Although I didn't receive answers on the disease itself, I found solutions to other care questions thatI have been thinking about in the back ofmy mind. Some aren't relevant at the present moment, but I feel a little more sure about the future knowing that I now have a network of experienced people who can point me in the right direction when I need help on a particular situation. This week, I attended my second support group meeting. This time, both my dad and my sister came with me. Our take-aways are different: my sister and I find it helpful to talk with others who are going through similar struggles. My dad, however,does not see the purpose or feel the need to talk about it with people. He has never been one to \"wear his feelings on his sleeve\". He grew up in a home where men were men-they don't cry and they don't show emotion. They don't express what they are feeling either. So for him, it is probably uncomfortable to put himself out there and talk about something so deep and personal (in a more emotional setting). While he particpated and vented his frustrations with the disease and with the doctors and all that we've been through over the past few years, he walked away questioning what he had gained from going. He was given the extra push to get the Power of Attorney done \"today\" (which was a great take-away in and of itself!) and was encouraged to find some thingand some time for himself. I do think there was some positive feedback and helpful advice for him, but I think he figures they are only telling him things that he already knows. I hope that he will give it another chance in the futureand see what he can gain from going. I suppose,at the end of the day, we each deal with our grief in different ways.I am taking each day step-by-step, as I try to figure out my role in all of this. I know that I need to be a support for my dad, as well as my mom. I've come to the mind that I need to find thelight in the darkness I face. Nothing will ever make this (mom's disease) a good thing. But I am determined to make some goodness out of the adversity. Whether it is building my patience or learning to serveor love unconditionally, or becoming a support for someone else, there is something that I can learn from all of this. I try each day to focus on what I can learn and how I can grow, rather than focus on what I have lost. My mom spent her life teaching me valuable life lessons on how to be the best person I can possibly be. She always told me that when we are faced with obstacles, we need to learn from them and \"rise above it\". Sometimes it is hard. There are days where I feel frustrated and where I feel downright depressed. But I can't let her down. Now is the time to learn and rise above the obstacle, and hopefullycome outa stronger, better person in the end.",

        "content": "I've been in a \"funk\" the past week or so. I knew this was going to be an emotional roller coaster. I was feeling really strong for a while; but for the past week I have been feeling really down. Nothing has really changed over the course of the week, but I've beennoticing a change in my dad.He is a self-employed contractor.Despite our horrible economy, he's been doing fairly well forhimself. The past few weeks, however, he hasn't had any work. He has been home everyday with my mom. Normally it wouldn't be such a terrible thing; and it's not that being with her is terrible. But it is difficult, and it can be depressing. Between the stress of not working and the stress of my mom (and finally slowing down enough to metally process her condition), my dad has seemed very depressed.My dad is my hero; he is the rock of our family. He is a go-getter and an optimist. He is not the kind of guy to show too many emotions; his attitude, when life gets hard,is a \"suck it up\" and \"deal with it\" kind of attitude. He never feels sorry for himself and he doesn't let a whole lot get to him.He is also one ofthe most giving people I know.You've heard of those kinds of people who would \"give you the shirt off their back\" if you needed it. My dad would give youthe shirt off his backand then go and buy you a dozen more.I have met very few people who are as generous and give so freely of their time and talents as my dad. When my grandfather (my mom's stepdad) was dying of Lou Gehrig's disease and needed round the clock care, my dad became his primary caregiver. He made time to work and stillbe there every single day to care for my grandpa. As tiring and as daunting a task that was, he never complained. Not once. It's been difficult to see this change in my dad over the last few weeks. I know it's not mom's health alone, but it isa big contributing factor. I can see that he is lonely. My mom is there physically, but mentally she's pretty far out there. She makes the same conversations day after day;talking about what a good driver she is, about this pain and that ache, about this medicine and that medicine, about her doctors, her upcoming visits, money...it's exhausting.Conversations with her consist of her sharing what is on her mind, the other personresponding, and mom acting as if she never heard a word. Sometimes she will give blanklooks, other times she will jump back into talking about the next thing she is thinking about.Occassionally, she will hear tidbits of what we say and that is after saying it repeatedly before it registers. Even then, she most often interprets things differently in her mind and hears something different than what we actually said. For example, my twin brother and his family are coming to visit next month over Memorial Weekend. Camping for Memorial Weekend has become somewhat of a tradition in our family. We usually go up to the mountains with our extended family to the same campground every year; we have been doing this since I was a kid. This year is a bit more complicated; dad needs new tires on their camping trailer and due to a lack of work, new tires are not in the budget right now. We have been talking about different options including going camping in our tents, without the trailer. However, my mom refuses to go without the trailer. She needs a shower, she needs to do her hair and her makeup, she's not comfortable tent camping...there is no flexibility or reasoning on the issue. I had a great idea. We have a campground only a couple of miles away from our house. It's not our usual, quiet place in the mountains, but it is close to home and has a lot of fun activities for the kids. It's close enough that my dad could probably drive the trailer down, and if not, it's close enough to home that mom can come during the day and return to her comfort at home in the evening. My dad seemed happy with this solution and talked to my mom about it. However, she apparently did not hear what he said. As I was driving her around yesterday, the topic came up. Immediately, her defense came up and she got upset with me.\"Your dad wants to go to the mountains too. And my brother's going too, he invited us too. Your dad said wewere going. He really wants to go too.\"Me: \"Mom, dad can't afford the tires for the trailer right now and the trailer can't make it that far on those tires. The only way we can go camping is to stay close to home.\"Mom: \"No, I'm not going camping in those other things\" (tents) \"I'm not comfortable in those. I want the trailer. I need a shower and to decorate my hair and other things too.\"I tried to repeat my point, \"Dad can't buy new tires right now, he isn't working.\"To which she replied, \"I already told him I'd give him the money from my savings or we could use the credit card too.\"My once-frugal mother is losing the concept of money. I tried explaining to her that they may need her savings for other things until dad gets some jobs lined up, and that to put something on a credit card means you have to have the money to pay it off. I don't know if she doesn't hear when I am talking or if her mind just can't process the words I am saying (though I'm fairly certainit's the latter).\"No we can just put it on a credit card. Your dad really wants to go. And if you go that other place then I'm not going!\"This is the condensed version of the conversation. Conversations like these can go on and on as we try to reiterate our point, hoping that she will hear what we are saying and eventually make sense of it. I am learning that it is pointless to argue with her. It makes as much sense as arguing with a two-year old. They are stubborn, they want only what they want and do not hear (or cannot yet process) most of what you say. They will pout and frown and make you miserable when they don't get what they want.This is how my mom has become. I am having to learn to let things go and not spend too much energy arguing and trying to reason with her. A friend (who was a caretaker to her Alzheimer's mother) told me that there comes a point when yougive up arguing altogether; youjust smile and tell them you love them. I understand her point completely.It is emotionally exhausting. I think I've been doing considerably well over the past couple of months. For the most part, I have been able to keep my cool with her and I've been able to talk and interact calmly with her. I was very patient with her when trying to book her a flight out to see her brother, which was a huge ordeal. She was stubborn about which airport she flew out of (the more affordable airport is further away), stubborn about the times (they either left too early, came in too late, or tooktoolong to get there)...she was confused on what luggageis and what layovers are (and why she has to fly to Colorado first to get to Montana) and threw little tantrums at the mere suggestion of a flight that wasn't ideal for her. It was extremely tiring. Yet somehow I was able to keep it together;my husband even commended me on my patience with her. This week, I think I am feeling a bit depleted; my patience is running thin. Yesterday, I was all too anxious to drop her off at home after our venture out. It was all I could do to keep my composure and not lose it. Ihate that I feel like this. There comes a point where it becomes too much to handle; as patient and understanding as wetry to be, it becomes difficult in times when that feeling of depression is beginning to overwhelm your sense of reasoning. I know that as bad as I am feeling, my dad is feeling worse. It's no wonder why he has been feeling depressed lately. I am beginning to feel it too. I feel helpless. I wish there was something that I could do for my mom to help her condition to improve; I wish there wassomething I could do for my dad to lift his spirit and help him to feel happy again. I lay awake at night, worrying about both of them and the road that lies ahead. My heart is heavy and I feel a dark cloud looming overhead. I know that I need to do something.I have heard that there are support groups for people dealingwith dementia. I've even researched it a little bit. There is nothing specifically for Semantic Dementia, but there are support groups for Alzheimers. I'm hesitant to go. It won'treally fix anything, it's not going to change my mom's condition. But I know that I need to do something to strengthen myself. My dad has been a rock for all of us over the years. Now it's my turn to be his.",

While researching the topic of how to slow down the process, I read that exposingthe \"ill\" personto life experiences will help to slow the progression of the disease. That means getting them out and doing things...shopping, vacations and trips, and so on. Pretty simple, right? Much easier said than done.A couple of weeks ago, we celebrated Easter in San Jose with my Aunt. Going to San Jose for Easter wasa tradition for us while I was growing up, and we wanted to have our kids experience the magic of Easter as we onceknew it. We knew that it wouldn't be as smooth sailing this time around with mom; in fact, there are many complicationsin traveling with her. A classic symptom of Semantic Dementia is to be set in a day-to-day routine and mom fits the mold perfectly of this characteristic. It's hard forher to deviate fromher normal routine, which makes getting out of the house a little tricky sometimes. Mom's routine revolves around two things: sleep and medicine. She stays in bed until 8:00 in the morning; it's extremely difficult to get her out of bed any earlier (although she seems to be doing okay getting up earlier on Sundays for church). At 8:30 am she takes her medicine, followed by drinking her Slim Fast for breakfast. She then showers and gets ready for the day, hair and make-up must be completely donewhether she intends to leave the house that day or not. At 10:00 am there is another medicine she takes for her headaches. At 2:30 she has another round of medicine to take; all of these medicines are for her aches and pains that she has throughout the day: headaches from her \"degenrative disc and narrowing spine\", her fibromyalsia medicine...I could write an entire post just about her medication. We'll save that for another day. Back to her routine: at 6:00 pm she can take some more headache medicine if her headaches have returned. At 8:30 pm she takes her last dose of medicine which includes a sleep aid that she is directed to take 1/2 hour before bedtime. At exactly 9:00 pm, exactly 1/2 hour after her medication,she is in bed. She has a hard time falling asleep. Sometimes she'll lay awake for hours or wake up throughout the night. But she must be in bed by 9:00 because \"it's very important\" to get her sleep.She fills in the times around her medicine doing word puzzles, playing solitaire on the computer, going to doctor appointments, and occassionally washing some dishes in the sink or doing a load of laundry. Sometimes she will sit on the couch and turn on some music and \"exercise\" by tapping her feet as she sits. She normally takes a nap midday, as she gets tired often. She cannot takeher medicationa minute late or a minute early. She will generally stroll in to the kitchen a few minutes before medicine time, get her medicine ready, and hold it in her hand until the clock is exactly on the right time. If we are out and about, she will look at whatever clock is nearby and then pull out her cell phone and compare times. Her cell phone is the most accurate, so that is the time she will go by. When I call mom to schedule errands or just a day out somewhere, her first response is always something like, \"The only thing is I have to be back by 2:30 because I have to take my medication.\"Followed by my response, \"You can always bring your medication with you mom.\"The first time she finally ventured out with her medicine (rather than waiting next to the clock at home), was when I took her out on a lunch date. She chose her favorite fast food Mexican place, Miguel's Jr, despite my efforts to get her to venture out to a nicer, sit-downrestaurant. Before we left the house, she told me that she had to take her headache medicine at 12:30. The first thing she did when we sat down at the table (around 12:10 pm) was get her bottle of medicine and set it on the table in front of her. At 12:28, with her lunch finished,she opened the bottle and said,\"It's 12:28, I think it will be okay if I take my medicine now.\"I know it sounds bad, but I decided to have a little fun with her. Conversations can become very depressing with mom; she can't talk about anything except her childhood memories, her health and medication, her not being able to drive...it gets very dull and lonely. Sometimes we feel like we just need to make light of the situation and \"spice it up\" a bit. So I played along with her.\"Are you sure you can take it two minutes early, mom? Are you sure it'll be okay?\" I gave her a little smirk to show her that I was teasing with her. But mom's sense of humor has long been gone. She doesn't understand when a person is joking around with her. She very seriously answered me,\"No, it'll be okay. It's only two minutes. It'll be fine.\"Still, she held the medicine in her hand, as if she wasn'treally certainif taking it two minutes early would be acceptable or not. She dug into her purse and found a piece of dental floss, which I had given her at my house the night before and she insisted was okay to clean and keep for later use, and flossed her teeth while she waited for the clock to change. She cleaned off the floss yet again, placed it back in her purse and looked at her cell phone once more to verify the time. 12:29. \"It's 12:29 now,I think I can take it now.\" She held it for about 20 seconds more before finally putting it in her mouth and flushing it down with a drink of water.Her inflexibility in her routines and medication does make it difficult to go places; but we've been working on her little by little and have at least gotten to the point where we can convince her (usually) to just take her medicine along wherever we're going.On the morning of Good Friday, my husband, children and I arrived at my parent's house around 7:30 am to load up my dad's truck and begin our drive up to San Jose. To my surprise, mom was up and ready, stuffing the last of her things into a suitcase. She hadthree bags just for herself, for our three day weekend trip. She had a suitcase just for her hair and make up products. She couldn't get it to all fit in the suitcase dad gave herand needed some help to work it out. When I suggested that she leave some things behind (for example her blowdryer-the hotel provides one), she became agitated with me. I knew leaving things behind wouldn't be an option so I found another bag and made it work for her.She actually did pretty well on the drive up to San Jose. She had to stop once for the bathroom. Of course she had to stop at 12:00 for lunch; we had planned for this and stoppedwhenwe saw aCarl's Jr.so she could have herhamburger and milkshake. She was silent for most of the drive, unless she had a critique for dad on his driving skills. When we arrived to Aunt Peggy's house, the first thing mom said when we walked into the house was,\"I can smell your dog in here. It's so funny how I can always smell your dog whenever I come over.\"I cringed when I heard her say it. I knew she was going to say it; she said it the last time. Her filter is gone; whatever is on her mind is on her tongue. Aunt Peggy is very patient and understanding, she just gave her a hug and changed the subject.The hardest part of the trip was working with mom's time schedule. Dinner was a little later than her usual 5:30. Aunt Peggy was making pizza, and only so many pizzas can be baked at one time. The first pizza came out and we fed the kids...and mom. She sat down with the kids and was done before any of them had a chance to let their pizza cool off. This is the usual with her; she's alwaysthe first to eat and she eats as if she hasn't had food in days. At 7:00-no matter if she's visiting at my house for our Sunday dinners, or if we're on vacation...wherever she's at-she begins pacing and talking about going home (or, in this instance, back to the hotel). \"When are we gonna go? Because I have to get ready for bed and I have to take my medication at 8:30. I have to be in bed by 9:00.\"This trip was no exception. It started around 7:00 and every ten minutes or so she would ask us when we were planning to leave. It is like having a little child nagging at you, except a little child can't tell time and remind you how many minutes are left until he/she has to be in bed. Since we had had a long drive up, the kids were a little tired too (surprisingly they didn't sleep in the car) so by 8:30 we wrapped up our first night's visit and made it back to the hotel. As soon as we were ina parkingspot, momjumped out of the car and disappeared in the hotel before the rest of us had even gotten out of the car; I'm not kidding. After I got my kids settled down (a few minutes past 9:00), I went next door to the room my parents were staying in, and sure enough, mom was in bed. The rooms webooked were studio rooms, so the bed was off to the side of the kitchen and living room. Mom kept yelling at dad for having the TV on, and the light. \"Why do you have the TV on at bedtime?....I can't sleep with that light...It's too noisy....You guys need to go to bed...You aren't supporting me...\"The next day we went to the zoo. Mom slept in as long as she could in order to be ready by 9:00 to leave to the zoo. I thought she did better than expected during the six hours we were there. She did complain about being hungry the closer we got to noon. The exhibits we were visiting weren't close to food and we wanted to finish seeing everything in that area before we made it back around to food. She reminded us quite frequently that she was hungry and that it was lunchtime. I have small children; anyone who has small children, or has spent any length of time with small children, knows that when they want something they will not let up until they get it. Especially when they are hungry. My mom is the same way. In fact, she is worse than my little kids. It was close to 1:00 before we made it to a food stand. Mom was the first to get her food and she finished before the rest of us even had a chance to get situated at the table.While visiting the various animal exhibits, she seemed to enjoy seeing the different animals, but she couldn't remember what most of them were. Sometimes she would ask, most times she just quietly walked around the exhibits and looked inside the cages.That night, we went back to Aunt Peggy's to eat dinner, dye Easter eggs with the kidsand visit. Mom did okay...her conversations are always a bit awkward. She has lost inhibition on what is appropriate conversation and what is inappropriate conversation. But like I said, Aunt Peggy and her family are very patient and accepting. They understand the situation and were just happy that we could be there. Around 7:00 mom started getting antsy again. At 8:30 she took her medicine and let us know that shedid soand had to be in bed 1/2 hour after she takes it. She needs to get back to the hotel now. She needs to get ready for bed. She needs her sleep or she's not getting up in the morning to go to Easter brunch with us. A few times, she leaned into Jeff and told him to tell my dad that we needed to go, that the kids needed to go and that \"he'll listen to you.\" Back at the hotel, thesame frustration and complaining ensued as the night before, with the lights and TV in the hotel room. The next morning was Easter, starting with brunch at our traditional restaurant, Pedros. I don't know if she made the connection that this was the restaurant had grown up eating at every year for Easter brunch. She was concerned about what kind of food they had and whether or not she would like it. Apparently she found some things that she liked and ate very little; she's not used to eating a big breakfast (it's usually Slim Fast). Back at Aunt Peggy's house, we sent the men out to the park to hide hundreds of plastic Easter eggs for the kids. Mom asked where they were going and I explained that they were hiding Easter eggs. I got a very confused look in response,\"Easter eggs?\"\"Yes, the plastic Easter eggs that we filled with candy,\" I told her.\"What are you talking about? Eggs with candy? You mean those plastic round things that we put candy in? Those aren't eggs.\"\"Yes mom, those are plastic Easter eggs. We filled them with candy and now they're hiding them for the Easter egg hunt.\"\"Hide them? Why would you do that?\"She followed us to the park and watched the kids as they ran and collected their eggs. There were several people who went with us; my cousins, their kids, and a couple friends of theirs. As soon as the first group left back to the house, she was gone. It was almost 2:30.That night was the most difficult night with her. It was our last night visiting with our family, and we weren't ready to rush out the door early. She became very upset when 8:30 came and went and we were still visiting. At night 9:00 she was pacing and nagging us to go. At 9:06 she came into the front living room, where my dad and I were talking with Aunt Peggy, and raised her voice and became angry. \"It's 9:06. I need to get back to the hotel. I need to get to bed, it's really important that I get my sleep...I took my medicine, I have to go to bed 1/2 hour after I take it...\"We tried to calm her down, get her to relax on the couch or lay down somewhere. There's no reasoning. Finally, shegave her usual, defensive response,\"You aren't supporting me...maybe I should go and die!\" and with that she stormed out of the room and back to the living room where my Uncle and Jeff were visiting. According to Jeff, she was quite upset and complaining while sitting with them.Not too long after her outburst, we said good-bye to Aunt Peggy and her family and drove back to the hotel, where mom ran upstairs and tucked herself into bed in record time.The drive home was fairly quiet and uneventful with mom-other than the driving criticisms and complaints of being tired (she could not sleep in the car, she had to keep her eye on the road to be dad's side seat driver).The normally-six-hour drive turned into eight-hours with traffic and potty breaks, and we arrived back to my dad's at 4:30in the afternoon.As soon as we got home,mom raced inside and locked herself in her bedroom for a nap, leaving dad with all the luggage and clean up. Apparently it was a tiring weekend for her.It's good to get people (who suffer from dementia) out and about. It's tiring for the people who are taking them out. It would be easier, sometimes, to just stay home and not have to deal with it. This has been difficult for our family, and especially for my dad who has to deal with this day in and day out. But, we are doing our best. We want her to be around as long as possible, so we continue to do whatever we can to keep her mind active and give her experiences to help her thrive.",

        "content": "When I was a child, my mommy could kiss any boo-boo and make it better. My mom was always a loving, compassionate mom. I remember the days when I would have to stay home from school sick; as much as I hated being sick and missing my friends at school, I secretly enjoyed the special attention I got from mom. She would lay out my pillow and blankie on the couch, turning on my favorite movies and make me hot jello broth to drink. She waited on me hand and foot, making sure to soothe any pain I had. When I had fevers, she would nurse me with a wet washcloth while I laid my head in her lap as she stroked my hair or scratched my back.When I was nine years old, I was hospitalized for asthma. My mom was taking college courses at the time, and the college was across the street from the hospital. In those three days that I spent in the hospital, she only left my side once to go to a class and turn in her work and get her other assignments. She made sure though, that somebody was there with me while she was gone. She slept on a cot in my room at night. I can't imagine more devotion from a mother for her sick child.The first time I was sick without my mom was when I went away to college. I had gotten a stomach bug and spent all night throwing up. My sweet roommate, at the time, did her best to nurse me back to health. But it wasn't the same as having my mom by my side. She tried to comfort me over the phone, but I longed to have her there with me; I knew she would know just how to take care of me.I was the last of my friends to get married and start having babies. As I watched each friend in the aftermath of their deliveries, I noticed that they all had their mothers there to stay with them for a while to help them adjust to their new roles as mothers. I had no doubt that it would be the same for me, when my time would come that I would start my family.My first pregnancy came approximately 7 years ago. I was SO sick. For the first week of my morning sickness, I could hardly get out of my bed. Even though my mom worked as a Head Start teacher in the afternoons, she would come over in the mornings to take care of me. I remember her making me toast and bringing gatorade in hopes to keep me hydrated. When my husband, Jeff, went out of town on a business trip, mom packed me up and had me come stay at her house so she could make sure I was taken care of. When it was time for delivery, mom was thrilled to be there for the birth of her first granddaughter, my baby girl, Aubrey. In the weeks afterwards, though she couldn't stay the night with me (due to her job), she was there nearly everyday to help me adjust to motherhood and make sure I got the nutrition I needed for breastfeeding. I felt very fortunate to have my mom with me; although at the time I didn't realize just how lucky I was.Three years later, I found myself pregnant with my second child. That pregnancy was worse than the first. By this time, my mom's disease had begun (though we didn't know this at the time). She was tired and achey all of the time, which she blamed on her heart condition, and really only thought about herself and her own aches and pains. Indeed, she had become somewhat self-centered. She would come by to help me only if I was completely desperate and had no other choice. When I was about four months pregnant, and barely getting over my morning sickness, our house sold. I had one week to pack up the contents of our entire house, with Christmas right in the middle of that week. Jeff had no time off work to help me, as he had just started a new job the week prior. I expected that my mom would be there to help me pack all of our belongings. But she was too tired and it was her Christmas break; she wanted time to rest. In between the nausea and sickness, I did my best to pack up our home-mostly by myself. Lucky for me, there were 3 dear friends from church who came over and helped me pack up my kitchen.\"Where is your mom?\" I remember one friend asking. I was embarassed to confess that she was at home, resting. She should have been there for me.On moving day, we had those same friends, along with my dad, come help us move everything, despite my inability to finish packing. By that point, things were just thrown into boxes and moved onto the truck.That following May, my doctor had set up my induction date for the delivery of our baby boy, Cody. I called my mom, excited to know the pregnancy was almost at an end. Of course my mom would be in the delivery room; that wasn't even a question. When there was a pause on the other end of the phone, I asked,\"You're going to be there, right?\"To which she responded, \"I don't know, I guess it depends on how early it is. I have a hard time getting up early these days. I can always come by later when I wake up, I'm sure you won't have the baby yet.\"I hung up the phone feeling hurt and angry. I was in utter disbelief at her selfish attitude. This was not the mother I once had. What was wrong with her? Why was she acting so selfish??Delivery day came and she strolled in the labor and delivery room mid-morning (I had arrived around five o clock that morning). She was happy to meet her new grandbaby, but left pretty quickly after he arrived; quite the contrast to my first delivery where she stuck around to attend her first bath in the nursery. In the week following, she came over once or twice after work for about half an hour or so to see the baby. But she was usually too tired to hang out for too long or to do anything helpful.Another three years later, I became pregnant with my third, and final, baby (who is now almost a year old). This pregnancy was the worst yet. It didn't help that I had three other kids to take care of: my own two children as well as my husband's niece, Maurina (then 14), whom we had adopted when Aubrey was a baby. On a typical day, I was throwing up anywhere from 2-4 times; sometimes more, sometimes less. I could hardly keep anything down. It was hard to function. I had no strength, no energy; it sounds drastic but I felt like I was dying, like I was slowly wasting away to nothing. I was fortunate to have a friend who helped me transport Aubrey to and from Kindergarten each day, but I was still left to pick Maurina up from the high school every afternoon. Most days I would lay on the couch all day, only getting up to tend to the kids; then I'd get the kids in the car to pick Maurina up from school and quickly pull into the driveway, leaving Maurina to get the kids out while I ran as quick as I could to the toilet. It was all I could do to keep from pulling over on the side of the road on the way home to relieve my horribly upset stomach.When we had moved (during my second pregnancy), we bought a house a mile up the road from my parent's. One would expect that I could call my mom to help me out; not the case. By this time, her disease (still undiagnosed) had progressed to the point that it resulted in a leave from her job, which meant she was home all day long. Not once did she come to take care of me. Not once. I remember one day, my son, Cody, got sick. He had been running high fevers for a few days. One afternoon, he woke up from his nap with a fever of 105 degrees! Of course it was one of my worst days of morning sickness. Every time I got off the couch, it resulted in a mad dash to the toilet bowl. I was extremely stressed out and desperate for help. I called my mom, knowing she wouldn't be jumping at the call to come help, but believing she would when I told her how high his fever had spiked. Her response?\"I'm laying down right now, I'm just so tired, I'm not feeling so well today. I'm sorry.\"After calling a couple other people and coming up with nothing, I lay on the bathroom floor in tears, while Cody sat in a lukewarm bath screaming his head off. I cried out of fear for my child, I cried out of anger and frustration with my mom, I cried out of mere exhaustion; at that moment I felt so alone and devastated. It was the moment when I was forced to face the cruel realization that I no longer had a mother to be there for me.She made it to the delivery room, where we welcomed Ryer into our family. It was pretty much the same scenario as with Cody: strolling in the room at mid-morning and leaving as soon as he was out. My OB also happens to be her OB, so as soon as he entered the room she made sure to tell him that she had an appointment with him in a few weeks because of all the pains she was having in her stomach, due to fibroids.After Ryder was born, I don't remember her coming over at all, aside from family dinners and other family gatherings. A week after Ryder's birth, Jeff had to return to work and I was on my own. I loaded the kids up in the car each morning and afternoon to take Aubrey to and from school. This required parking up the hill from the school (parking is a nightmare over there!), pulling out the heavy double stroller to load both boys in and pushing them downhill to the school and then back up to where we parked. The crossing guard made a comment to me one morning, that first week after he was born,\"I can't believe you're back out here already after just having a baby!\"What choice did I have? Somebody had to take her to school. This past week has been another tough one for me. Aubrey developed a fever last week, along with a horrible cough and head cold, which she graciously shared with Cody and me. I've been struggling to take care of the kids and give myself some rest at the same time. When moms get sick, they don't get a day off. I envy my sister-in-law, who has her mother to nurse her back to health and help with her kids whenever she gets sick. I used to have that. And I feel sad that I no longer have that for myself. I am trying not to throw myself a pity party, but in the moments when I am weak, when I just want to go take a nap and rest my achey, feverish, sick body rather than tend to rowdy kids, I just want my mom back. It doesn't matter how old you get, a girl always needs her mom.I've said it before: I've spent many years in anger with mom over these events. I realize, now, that it is beyond her control. It doesn't take the hurt away, but it's a different kind of hurt. The anger that was once directed towards her has been rerouted. I will always hold dear the memories of who my mom once was. I know there will come a time when it will be my turn to repay her for the many years she spent nurtuing me back to health. It's scary to look at the future and think about me nursing my mother; I'm not entirely sure of what that means yet. But I am trying to prepare myself for what is to come.",

        "content": "My mom has always been the perfect driver, and I mean perfect. We're talking a perfect 3-car following distance, hands always directly on ten and two o clock, stopping for a complete three seconds at the stop-sign, never going a mile over (or under) the speed limit...she was always a textbook driver. In over 30 years of driving, she has never had a ticket or an accident. Perfect. With the memory loss problems she has been having, she has prided herself on her ability to continue driving.Over the past year or so, we've noticed mom's driving skills are not quite up to her once-high standard. She tailgates and puts on the brakes suddenly. I remember following behind her in our own car, not too long ago, and she suddenly slammed on the brakes at a green light because a small tumble weed had blown in front of her. Luckily we had a safe distance between us and were able to stop before we hit her. Another time, she was driving my dad and reminiscing about her old family home down the street and she slowed down her speed. Dad had to tell her that it wasn't safe to suddenly slow down in the middle of traffic just to lookey-loo around. Needless to say, we haven't felt too comfortable with her behind the wheel and more recently we won't ride in the car with her driving. She, however, sees no problems in her driving, even after her very first fender-bender a couple of months ago. She was backing out of her parking spot when she hit a car behind her. She claims that person came from out of nowhere, and that is possible. But with her focus and attention difficulties, it's hard to know the truth. That was the first time we were forced to think about if she was really safe behind the wheel.We knew it would be a battle when the day came that we'd have to take the keys, and quite honestly, I think it was a battle that my dad was not ready to face. UCLA made the decision for us, ready or not. They informed my dad that they are mandated reporters, which means that they are madated to report to the DMV the diagnosis of mom. They told him that they would receive a notice in the mail from the DMV and that mom could go down to the DMV to take a test if she was adamant that she is still able and competent to drive. The doctor wrote my dad an order on a perscription slip of paper with the words \"Do Not Drive\". Mom was very unhappy with the \"stupid\" doctors who said she couldn't drive and would not accept their order. My dad thought that he needed to break her in slowly (let her get used to the idea for a little bit) and was under the impression that she was still able to drive until they received notice from the DMV. After talking it over with several people-my sister, my Aunt and Uncle, another Aunt, and myself-my dad finally accepted the harsh reality that he was going to have to take the car keys.Saturday night, my dad tried explaining to my mom that she was not allowed to drive. He told her that I would be over to pick her up at 8:30 am the following morning for church, since he would already be gone to church meetings prior to 8:30. She argued back and forth with him, not comprehending why she was ordered not to drive. She insisted that she's \"a good driver\". He tried to explain to her that she has a condition called dementia, and that people with dementia are not allowed to drive. That explanation went completely over her head.I knew that she wasn't going to readily accept her new fate. And so I was prepared that on Sunday morning, I would most likely have a fight on my hands. I called her at 8:15 to remind her that I was coming. She gave me an adamant \"NO, you are not coming to drive me, I can drive myself....I don't know why they're saying I can't drive, I've always been a good driver...\" The argument ensued for the next ten minutes as I tried to calmly and gently explain to her that she was not allowed to drive. She wouldn't give in. Frustrated, I tried to call my dad. No answer. I sent him a text stating that she was refusing to go with me. I got in the car and drove to my mom's house. When I walked in the door, she had her back to me and ignored me, looking for something in a box of paperwork on the floor. I could see right away that she was mad. Fuming mad. With much hostility in her tone, she told me,\"I'm not going with you, no. I can drive myself\".I asked her what she was looking for. \"That paper thing your dad says the doctor wrote. I want to see that.\"Immediately, I found the note written on the prescription slip with the orders \"Do Not Drive\". I showed it to her, and she snatched it from my hand. Remaining calm, I tried to explain to her what the note meant. If she were caught driving against these orders, she could get in trouble. My words didn't register with her.\"I'm feeling really sad that you guys are all picking on me. I'm not happy with this doctor, he doesn't even know me. I'm not a bad driver, there's no reason why I can't drive.\"Everything she says is with anger and hostility in her tone and with a scowl on her face. She put the note in her purse.\"I'm taking this to my Bishop too. And I'm taking it to Dr. Thio too. I'm mad at your dad for doing this to me.\"I take a deep breath, \"Mom, your Bishop can't do anything about it and neither can Dr. Thio.\"She responded with, \"I don't know why he's punishing me. I'm not going back to those doctors, I don't like them. It makes me feel like maybe I should just go die then!\"When she gets angry, and feels like she is being picked on, mom makes comments about dying. At first, we weren't sure how to respond to this. Sadly, we are becoming accustomed to these outbursts and know that it is her defense mechanism.I tried to tell her that nobody is punishing her. We are not doing this because we're upset with her. I put my arm around her and told her that we are taking her to these doctors because we love her and want to help her. These doctors at UCLA are the best of the best, they have found out what is going wrong in her brain and it's called dementia. People with dementia are not able to drive. Sure, she may be okay today. But over time it will get worse and she may end up hurting somebody, or hurting herself.She shook her head and answered with a firm and angry \"No. I'm not going with you. I just won't go to church then.\" She plopped down on the couch, with her arms folded on her lap, each hand hugging the opposite elbow and her back slumped over.I sighed. Just then, my dad called. He told me he had just gotten out of his meeting. He asked to talk to my mom; she refused to talk to him. He told me that he would swing by to talk to mom and coax her to come with him to church. I sat next to my mom on the couch while I waited for my dad, and with her head hung down and eyes fixed on her skirt, she snaps,\"At least this shirt matches this color,\" as she points to a paisley design in her skirt.\"What?\" I was a little taken aback by the abrupt change in subject.\"At least this shirt matches. My skirt has some of this other blue color too. It's good I don't have to wear my black shirt,\" she says, not looking up, and most certainly not without the scowl on her face or crank in her tone.I gave her a smile. \"It's a nice skirt mom, is this the new one you bought at Kohl's the other day?'\"Yes,\" she snapped back. It was quiet for a minute, and then she began her rant and argument about the driving situation. \"I have to drive....I have appointments to go to, you're not gonna take me to them...\" It goes on and on.A few minutes later, my dad walked through the door. Initially, she ignored him. When she could no longer resist, she stood up and began her protest once again with him. He told her that \"besides, your tire on your car is flat. You can't drive your car anyway\" to which she accused him \"you did that on purpose.\" (In fact, it was just a coincidence that her back tire had become flat that morning...I hadn't even noticed it when I walked to the door).She continued to argue and looked at the clock; 8:45. She once again threw herself on the couch and said \"I'm gonna be late now. I'm just not going!\"It takes 10 minutes to get to the church. One of mom's obsessions is time. She has to be very early or she thinks she's late. My dad was very patient and very gently took her by the arm and said \"Come on dear, let's go.\"Eventually, after a few more protests, she gave in. But she made sure that my dad knew the entire drive to the church that she was not happy about this and that she was going to make sure to tell her other doctors about this. She will not go down without a fight!At family dinner that night, she pulled my Aunt into my daughter's room as soon as Aunt Sharon walked in the door (Aunt Sharon is a nurse). She told her all about the incident and asked her what she thought. Aunt Sharon was very honest; she told her that we did the right thing and tried to explain some things to my mom. Most of it went over her head. She holds firm that she has always been a good driver and doesn't deserved to be \"punished\".Today I drove her to her hair appointment. She seems to have calmed down a bit. Maybe once her tire is fixed she'll get a new wind. She told me she was thankful that I drove her to get her hair done. She also expressed her feelings, yet again, on the topic. I expect it will be a hot topic for quite some time. Every new person she runs into will hear all about it. We just need to be patient with her. It's a hard thing to lose one's independence. I feel for her. I know this isn't any easier on her as it is with us. We, at least, understand her condition. She is not capable of grasping what is going on in her brain. In the meantime, we are all doing our best to help this transition go smoothly.",

        "content": "When somebody near and dear to you is diagnosed with a terminal illness, there is a cycle of grief that you generally go through. In fact, it even has a name: the Kubler-Ross Five Stages of Grief. Generally, it refers to the person who is diagnosed with the illness. But I believe it is very much the same for the family members and close friends of the diagnosed person as well. The stages differ for each person. Some may skip a stage. Some stages linger longer than others. And sometimes you return to stages that you've already gone through. There is no one way to go about this process; grieving is a very personal thing. But in general, there is a pattern of 5 different stages that people go through when they learn they will be losing someone they love.1. Denial: \"The test results must be wrong\"...\"there must be a mistake\"...\"there is some way that we can beat this\"...these are all common thoughts during this stage. It's a difficult thing to accept a devastating reality, and many people refuse to believe it.2. Anger and grief: This can manifest itself in many different ways. Some people feel angry with themselves; other times their anger is taken out on others around them. There is a feeling of wanting to blame somebody for what is happening.3. Bargaining: If a person has a God he/she believes in, there is usually pleading or bargaining with Him to spare the life of the ill person.4. Despair and depression: This is similar to grief. but with depression comes an emotional attachment with a sort of acceptance. Each person handles depression differently, but usually a person who is depressed detaches themselves from others, preferring to be alone with their feelings of despair. It's natural to feel sadness, regret, fear, etc. These are the steps to acceptance.5. Acceptance: This varies greatly from person to person, but generally there is some sort of emotional detachment as the person accepts what is to come. The person diagnosed with an illness usually comes to this point much sooner than the family/friends they leave behind.Like I said, this is a cycle, which means it goes round and round. You may find yourself working through one stage, getting through it, and then returning to it at a future date. I think it also varies with each illness. In our case, dealing with dementia has been quite a different experience than dealing with other diseases; for example, Lou Gehrig's disease (which we experienced with my grandfather). Though there are the 5 basic stages of grieving, I think there is a far broader range of emotions that one goes through when dealing with this sort of illness.My mom's \"illness\" has been an interesting cycle for us. I can't write exactly what my family has experienced in this cycle (though I've seen them go through various stages); what I can write about is my experience with it. It is unique, in that we did not get the \"earth shattering\" news all at once. As I explained before, this has been a gradual process, beginning around the time of her surgery (and in hindsight, it actually started at least a year before her surgery). I would say that my grieving process started before I had any idea that she was \"sick\"; I just didn't realize it at the time. I have felt a broad range of emotions over the past few years: hurt, anger, frustration, resentment, guilt, sadness-just to name a few. It's been hard to process all of these emotions-mostly because I didn't realize they were attached to an illness. It makes so much more sense now that we have a diagnosis and I feel like I am finally able to sort out many unresolved issues that I have had over the past few years.Semantic Dementia begins with a sort of detachment between the person and the people in their lives. They become forgetful and distracted, tired and self-centered. In the beginning, I felt hurt when my mom started to lose interest in me and in my children. I felt hurt when I would call her on the phone to vent a frustration, a sadness or even a joy, only to hear her on the other line changing the subject to the ache she's been feeling in her arm; no response to what I had just said to her. She never wanted to be bothered to watch the kids so we could go out on a date night; she was always too tired. It hurt to see other grandmas doting on their grandbabies and I felt like there was something wrong with me, or my kids, that made my mom detach. I couldn't understand it or make sense of it.Eventually her detachment led me to anger. Why didn't she care anymore about what I have to say? Why didn't she want to engage and take advantage of living closeby her grandbabies? I felt resentful at her selfishness, and angry that she did not appreciate having us live nearby and that she did not seem to want the close mother/daughter relationship I craved; the relationship we once had. I felt resentment when I would see friends going out and spending time with their mothers. Why couldn't I have a relationship like that with my mom? I had once had it, why had it changed? What did I do wrong?I felt myself begin to pull away from her. I suppose it was a wall I had built to guard myself against the pain of rejection. For a while, I was bitter and maybe even cold towards her. I can remember it being Mother's Day, and while I celebrated the joy of being a mother, I secretly mourned my mother because I felt that, in many ways, I had no mother. I had pent up feelings of anger and bitterness inside and didn't feel like I had much to celebrate with my mom. I feel guilty about those feelings now, knowing what I know about her illness. But at the time, I was unaware of what was going on with her and I was reacting only at the hurt that I felt.As time went on, and her behavior became more and more odd, my anger started to turn to frustration. It was apparent that something else was going on, and we suspected it was due to her surgery. My sister and I researched several options of what was making mom so \"weird\" and after stumbling upon information about \"temporal lobe damage\", we concluded that was the cause. Of course the anger returned, this time directed at the doctors who we felt were responsible. Somebody needed to be held responsible for the damage that was caused, for the person they took away from us. We even went so far as consulting an attorney on the issue. We took my mom's 8-inch thick medical file to that attorney's office and were convinced he would tell us we had a case. Instead, he looked through the file, reading her history, zeroing in on her surgery, and said that, although there was definitely something going on with her, nothing looked out of the ordinary as far as the surgery was concerned. We were left feeling confused, angry and hopeless.Several people had thrown out the idea of dementia. Perhaps part of this was the denial phase for me. I was adamant that it was not dementia, but brain damage from the surgery. It was the only thing that made sense to me-to my entire family. I suppose deep down we all knew it was a possibility. But to admit dementia was to admit that she would never come back. Even with \"brain damage\", she would never return to the person she once was. But we thought she would eventually adapt and learn to live with the changes and live a somewhat normal life. With dementia, there is nowhere to go but downhill.It has been a week since mom's trip to UCLA, where the doctors have said that all signs point to Semantic Dementia. As I researched exactly what that meant, my heart hurt and I experienced so many emotions over those next few days. I felt guilt; guilt that I had so wrongly misjudged her. I felt anger; angry that I would inevitable lose my mom. I felt fear of what is to come in the future. I watched my grandfather suffer in his final days, as he lost the ability to care for himself. Is this what is to come for my mother? Is she going to eventually forget who I am? Will she be unable to care for herself at some point? I feet sadness at the time that I had wasted in my misguided anger at her. I feel sorry for what has happened to her. Her life, as we once knew it, is gone and she's still relatively young; only 50 years old.I know that this will be a rollercoaster ride. I feel much stronger now than I did a week ago when we received the initial news. But I am sure that will change as time goes on. We are still awaiting an MRI, where they will get a closer look at what is going on in her brain. I have prepared myself, mentally, for more bad news. Even though I feel strong now, I may revert back to a \"depression\" or \"denial\" stage, depending on what the results say.I think that over the past week, I have had some time to reflect. I wouldn't say that I have passed the grieving stage completely. I am finally able to talk about it without crying (for now, anyway). I have realized, to some degree, what this disease means and I know that there are some tough times ahead. I know that everyday is a gift from God, and we must use this time wisely. I will not spend another day angry and bitter, ashamed and embarassed at my mother. Instead, I will embrace the time that I have left with her. I am preparing myself to be there, physically and emotionally, for both my mom and my dad. I'm prepared for a rough road ahead, but I am thankful to have a strong family to help each other get through the ups and downs that lie ahead.",

        "content": "One night, when I was pregnant with my first child, I made the mistake of watching \"The Notebook\" for the very first time. The movie starts with the romantic story of young love and evolves into a heartwrenching tale of that same young girl who had developed dementia and forgotten her husband. He reads to her from a notebook every night, in hopes that he will spark her memory of the powerful love they once shared. I'm not generally a crier in movies. But as I saw the scenes play out, with his determination to \"bring her back\", it broke my heart. I bawled my eyes out that night. There were three things I concluded from watching that movie: 1-never watch a tearjerker when you're pregnant 2-when it's my time to go, it will be in my sleep with my husband's arms wrapped around me, the two of us leaving this earth together and 3-dementia is one of the most devastating diseases known to man. That movie haunted me for the better part of the weekend. I couldn't shake off the feeling of sadness. Imagine living in a world where you can't remember anyone, least of all the people who you loved and have loved you best. Imagine having your loved one not remember who you are. What a painful situation.My mind now wanders back to \"The Notebook\". Is that what the end will look like for my mom? Will there come a point in time where my mom will no longer remember who I am? Will there come a point where she will no longer remember my dad, who has been her sweetheart since childhood? The thought of it stabs me in the heart. I don't know all of the answers. There are many unknowns and I've compiled my list of questions for the next trip to UCLA. In the meantime, I've done my research in hopes of finding some answers to these difficult questions. I'm afraid the answers haven't brought me any comfort. I've spent the past three days on the verge of tears. I am finding it difficult to concentrate on much else. My mind keeps returning to the studies I've read on the disease. My heart aches as I picture the road that lies ahead. This is what I've learned about Semantic Dementia.First, Semantic Dementia is very rare. It is a genetic defect that usually comes \"out of the blue\", with no family history of the illness. Although it can be hereditary, it is a small percentage of the Semantic Dementia \"population\" where this is the case. This is probably the best news I have read on the illness. I would be lying if I said that the fear hasn't crossed my mind that I will someday inherit dementia. The age of onset is usually between the ages of 50-65, give or take a few years. My mom will be 51 in May; she was 46 when she likely began exhibiting these symptoms.Sematic Dementia is in the frontotemporal lobe dementia category, which makes sense why we at first thought it was temporal lobe damage from her surgery (many of the symptoms are the same). There are four major symptoms to look for in Semantic Dementia:1. Language-sufferers will have a hard time remembering what certain objects are called. They will use words incorrectly. They have a hard time processing things that are said to them and difficulty in processing what words mean.2. Recognition of Faces and Objects-they have difficulty recognizing people whom they do not see regularly. They can also have difficulty recognizing certain objects (such as a carrot in the grocery store).3. Memory-there is problem in memory, but only a certain type of memory, which is called Semantic memory. Semantic memory tells you who faces represent, what objects signify, what words mean. While there is a disconnect in this area of memory, other memories are well preserved, such a how to drive to familiar places, or recalling certain events from the past.4. Personality and Behavior- sufferers become inflexible and self-centered. They have no awareness of the feelings of others. They may become preoccupied with only a few activities and adopt a fixed daily routine (they have to do certain things at certain times).The sufferer is not able to control any of these behaviors or difficulties. They are usually aware of some of the difficulties; my mom knows that she has a problem remembering who people are. It is embarassing for her. But she does not understand the extent of her disabilities, as is the case with all sufferers of Semantic Dementia.I stumbled onto a site which broke down the stages of Semantic Dementia.First comes the mild stage. Memory of day-to-day events are usually spared. This stage starts with the language problems. Words that aren't commonly used are replaced by words such as \"thing\". My mom has adopted some new favorite words. She uses the word \"too\" at the end of nearly every sentence. She says \"thing\" for objects or words that she can't remember. Other favorite words, which will come up in any given conversation, include \"blessing\", \"severe\", \"correctly\" or \"incorrectly\", \"supportive\", \"delicious\". She'll use phrases like \"which is good\" repetitively.After a few years comes the moderate stage. This is when they have trouble understanding what others are saying. There is increasing difficulty in recognizing faces and names of people, even friends and family. They develop behavioral problems similar to those who suffer frontotemporal lobe damage (ftd). Mom has much difficulty in these areas, as I have already mentioned. If she does not see a person on a regular basis, she will not remember who they are. It doesn't matter if that person was her maid of honor and best friend for 15 years. It doesn't matter if they nieces or nephews that have been away for a while, or my best friend who was like a daughter to her. If she doesn't see them regularly, she cannot place them.After 4-5 years is the severe stage. This is where the disease becomes more advanced. Their behavior becomes worse. Some behaviors include apathy, compulsions, altered food preference, impaired facial recognition and weight gain. They tend to show interest in games with symbols and words. When I read about the \"severe\" stage, my heart sank into my stomach. This is my mom in a nutshell. Aside from the memory/recognition problems, and her behavior problems, she has gained weight (which she constantly complains about) and has developed an altered food preference. She loves hamburgers, milkshakes, tortellini and frozen mixed vegetables. Those are her staple foods. She is a picky eater-worse than my three year old. If we fix something she doesn't like, she brings her \"delicioius\" tortellini. She has compulsive behaviors; she will not step a toe onto the porch without her make-up on. She is obsessed with her time schedule. She has to take her medication on the dot...8:30 am, 2:30 pm, 8:30 pm. Not a minute before, not a minute after. Lunch is at noon, dinner is at 5:30 and bedtime is 9:00. My mom spends her days playing card games on the computer and doing word puzzles on the couch.It is alarming, but it seems as though she fits under the severe category.What is the prognosis?People diagnosed with Semantic Dementia are usually given between 6-8 years to live.",

        "content": "It's always been hard for me to verbally express how I am feeling. Now I'm not talking about if you cut in line in front of me at the grocery store, or if you have something rude to say about my kids. In those situations, I have no problem telling you exactly what I think. But when it comes to things that are near and dear to my heart, things that really dig into my emotions, it is a different story. I tend to bottle those feelings up inside of me. I find it easier to express my thoughts and my emotions through writing, rather than through spoken word.My mom has been acting funny for the past few years. She was born with a heart murmur, and over the past several years, her condition had worsened. It eventually got to the point that she needed a repair on her leaky heart valve. In order to avoid open heart surgery, she opted to try a new procedure where the doctors went in labroscopically to repair the damage. Because this doctor had never before done this procedure, there was a long waiting period until the actual surgery took place. During that wait time, my mom began to change. She began to tire easily, she lost a lot of energy. She developed a lot of aches and pains. She started losing interest in her grandkids, which she attributed to her fatigue and body aches. All of this, she said, was a result of her heart condition. The surgery would make it better, she assured us. We were frustrated with the changes we saw in mom, and we all counted down the days for her surgery, in hopes that the mom and grandma we once knew would return back to normal.Fast forward now to surgery, June of 2009. The new procedure was a success-as far as her heart was concerned. It took longer than anticipated, totaling 12 hours of time under anesthesia. She had a little bit of internal bleeding, but they immediately took her back in and corrected the problem. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary during those first few weeks of her recovery. Within a few months, however, we started noticing problems with her memory. She was becoming a little forgetful with names and faces. She would run into friends at the grocery store and draw a blank on who they were. When discussing this with her doctor, it was concluded that there could be several reasons for her forgetfulness. Maybe it was menopause. Maybe it was the surgery; sometimes after a surgery (particularly a heart surgery) and anesthesia, it can take a while for people to get back to \"normal\". They say that memory can slightly be affected and that it could take a full year for a person to be back to their normal selves. We waited, trusting in the doctors, thinking that it was just the aftermath of anesthesia.Moving forward: January of 2010. My mom's mother very suddenly passed away. My mom was extremely close to grandma. As soon as I got the phone call, I raced to my mom's house, sure that she was falling apart. When I arrived at her house, I could tell she had been crying. She went to her room to do her hair and make-up so that we could go grandma's house, where the family was gathered. And by the way, nobody else bothered to do their hair and make-up before going over. We all thought it was bizarre behavior. As she went back to her room to get ready, she wiped away the last of her tears, and I mean the last of her tears. Throughout the next week and even at the funeral, mom shed no tears for her beloved mother.At grandma's house, the family all mourned her sudden death and voiced their concerns about grandpa (who was dying of Lou Gehrig's disease). Mom voiced her concern about the charter bill and my sister's car payment, which was late. She rambled to my cousins about her pioneer ancestors, while we all just sat there crying and trying to make sense of what had just happened to grandma.At grandma's funeral, my dad's brother came to offer his condolences. My mom looked at him and said \"Remind me who you are again?\" She could not place her brother-in-law, whom she had known for over 30 years.I think that was the turning point for us in realizing that there was something wrong with mom. Something really wrong, more than just the \"affects\" of surgery wearing off.As time went on, mom's memory worsened, and her behavior became more and more bizarre. In late 2010, she had an incident at work, which resulted in a temporary suspension and tension between her and her co-workers. She lost focus on any conversations that were not about her, or what was on her mind. In fact, we discovered that there were really only 3 topics that she would conversate about: her problems at work, her health (constant complaints of every ache and pain in her body), and her religion/pioneer ancestry. Every person she came into contact with had to hear the same stories and conversations on one of these 3 topics.Throughout 2011, her memory continued to worsen. People often approached me to say \"I saw your mom in the store the other day...she looked scared when I talked to her...she acted like she didn't know me\". We would have conversations at the dinner table, sometimes even about her, and she had no clue what we were talking about. She couldn't focus on what we were saying. She had some very strange social behaviors and felt like everyone was \"picking\" on her when we would disagree with one of her oddities. This was when my dad began to get aggressive on finding answers to her problems. He went to one doctor after another, only to come out with no resolution. A CT scan in August showed that there was some \"shrinkage\" in the brain, but aside from writing her a prescription for meds, the neurologist did nothing to help us understand what this meant. In fact, he kind of dismissed it and offered the test results only as an afterthought as he talked about his own experience of heart surgery.Over the course of the last year, our frustration has grown immensely (to say the least). Mom's condition seems to be getting worse. Her behavior has, at times, driven us on the verge of insanity, and we are getting no answers from any of these \"specialists\" that we have taken her to see. My dad has had the stress of battling with social security, after she took a leave from work due to her inability to function properly, only to have her denied because the doctors see no reason to sign a disability form. Each one refers us to the next guy, and nobody will take responsibility and sign the forms, even though it is quite clear that she is not in her right mind and is unable to work at full capacity. They are quick to give her drugs, but not so quick to take the time to figure out what is wrong with her.We began our own research (with the CT scan results as our base) and were pretty much convinced that the damage in her brain was due to a lack of oxygen during her 12 hour surgery in 2009. My sister and I researched \"temporal lobe damage\" and many of the behaviors she exhibited seemed to coincide with that diagnosis. Problem solved. Now if we could only get the doctors to get on the same page as us and try to figure this out.No such luck. It's one big game of ring-around-the-rosies. My dad has made phone call after phone call, gone from doctor appointment to doctor appointment, even collected all of her medical records, consulted an attorney, and still at the end of it came out empty handed. No answers. Among the phone calls he made was a call to the UCLA Medical Center, a place where people travel across the globe to seek answers for their medical mysteries. He was able to get an appointment for mom to meet with the specialists there. Finally, a glimmer of hope.That brings us to this week: mom's appointment at UCLA. At 9:00 am, dad made the drive out to UCLA. At 6:30 pm, he finally made it back home. Granted, California traffic sucks. But he, and my mom, spent a good amount of time with a panel of doctors who actually took the time to access her condition. They looked at her medical history, they looked at her CT scan, they observed her behaviors, they talked with her and with my dad, they asked dad questions, they asked mom questions. They took their time and genuinely listened and showed concern for everything my dad had to say. They are dedicated to finding answers for my mom, for our family.This is the good news. The bad news is that this is not brain damage from the surgery. Why is that bad news? It's bad news because it means that she has dementia. They are 90% certain that she suffers from a very rare form of dementia, called Semantic Dementia. An MRI will be scheduled in the very near future to get a more clear look at what is going on in her brain. But based on everything we have to say, based on the CT scan, their observations, her medical history and other questions asked and tests they performed, it seems almost certain that it is Semantic Dementia. An MRI will only seal the deal. They sent dad home with a booklet on information about the disease. I read the booklet. I've googled the facts. I've visited several websites. I'm convinced their diagnosis is accurate. The outlook is not so good.So here I am. I have spent the past 3 days in a fog, as the words play over and over in my brain. Semantic Dementia. I know what this means. We have a very long road ahead of us. I write this blog for my own, personal therapy. I write this blog for all of those who ask what is going on with my mom. I write this blog to get a better understanding of this disease and in hopes to provide answers to others who might find themselves in this situation. This is our journey with dementia.",
