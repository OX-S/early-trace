        "content": "With 6 Important Questions to Ask Ourselves at End of This Post It Takes A Village (The following, taken from my manuscript, is copyrighted, nonfiction except for the names, and may not be reproduced without permission)A social worker who worked with older adults in New York, reminds us \u201cIt takes a village to raise a child,\u201d then points out that at the other end of the life cycle \u201cIt takes a village to keep the grandparent in the village.\u201d Meet Bob. For him the village provided both care management and relationships.Bob had no family to watch out for him, yet he continued to live in the small suburban New York studio apartment he and his wife, Ruth, had shared until the day of his death at age 84.He was 72 and retired on a small pension when Ruth died. He had the beginnings of macular degeneration, was an unrepentant smoker, and had only a few friends. But they supported him in his time of need by inviting him to dinner, giving him the key to their home so he could play their piano, and having him help them by walking their dogs when they were at work. In all, five unrelated people, decades younger than Bob, looked out for him.In the twelve years following Ruth\u2019s death, Bob\u2019s macular degeneration worsened; at 80 he quit driving. One dog owner wrote his checks, which he signed, so his bills got paid. Another friend took him marketing until walking became a problem, whereupon she did his grocery shopping. Two years before his death he could walk only a short distance before wheezing, coughing, and labored breathing made walking difficult. Going to the doctor became difficult. At a certain point he refused to go for anything other than a flu shot.Responding to a suggestion of assisted living, Bob let it be known that he had no intention of going into one of \u201cthose\u201d places, where he\u2019d have half the space and wouldn\u2019t be allowed to smoke. He didn\u2019t need good vision to navigate his small apartment\u2014or to light his cigarette for that matter. His home was his anchor, his safe haven.When his unopened mail overflowed the table, and food began to mold in the refrigerator, and the apartment became a mess, another of Bob\u2019s younger friends called the town\u2019s social services for the aged. Bob was interviewed and charmed the social worker with his fine mind and love of music and poetry.The result: Disaster Masters came to clean up\u2014and out\u2014Bob\u2019s apartment, with Bob sitting there directing what stayed and what went. Meals on Wheels began bringing food. A home-aide came for an hour, three mornings a week at 8am, to do laundry and straighten up before going to her other jobs. The social worker arranged for three volunteers to come weekly for socializing. One, a woman, loved poetry and read poems to Bob every Thursday.With the necessities taken care of and additional daily monitoring by two neighbors on his floor, Bob was able to remain in his apartment until the morning he died peacefully in his bed at age 84.Bob had no family members to care for him. He liked living alone. Contrast his experience with that of Ellie\u2019s grandmother, in Eastern Canada, who was surrounded by well-meaning family members.A Flower Pulled up by the Roots \u201cMy grandmother was a farmer in the early days. Later she and my grandfather lived in a home with a big piece of property where Grandma raised flowers and vegetables. She had such pride in her garden and was in it every day she could be. When Grandfather died, her children wanted her to move to a smaller place and not have the burden of a large home and grounds and they talked to her about it\u2014again and again and again.  \"In time, Grandma said she would move. I felt this was the wrong thing for her to do, since the garden meant so much to her, and with 28 relatives, I was going to organize it so she\u2019d have someone visiting each day, could keep her independence, and could be monitored. \"Finally, one day she said: \u2018Put the house up for sale.\u2019 She then moved in with my mother\u2014and died a year later.\u201dAccording to the wise octogenarian (quoted previously in the manuscript), we also need to realize that \u201cAs you age, you lose the energy to fight... and give in.\u201d This may be the reason Ellie's\u2019s widowed grandmother finally agreed to move in with one of her children.While the \u201cvillage\u201d enabled Bob to live out life on his terms without family involvement, the loving adult children and grandchildren who surrounded Ellie\u2019s grandmother exerted influence that produced a different outcome.With usually only one chance to do it right, asking ourselves the following questions can serve as guidelines for better decision-making:When making decisions or promises, what is the priority: our needs or our parents\u2019 needs?Are our decisions aimed at maintaining parents\u2019 independence until it\u2019s no longer safe for them to remain as they are?Are we mindful of not prematurely undermining any of the essential ingredients for aging well--self-esteem, independence, socialization, having fun (activities)?Do we have all the information we need to make\u2014or help our parents to make\u2014the best informed decisions?Is it possible that old emotions from our growing-up days creep into and influence our decision-making?If unresolved relationship issues remain, does it make sense to seek the counsel of others when making important decisions?The above is copyrighted and may not be reproduced without the author's permission. * * *While most of us are no doubt excellent caregivers or reliable mainstays for our aging parents, there can be siblings as well as other family members who think they know what's best. It's not only frustrating, but can lead to outcomes that are worse for parents than if they had no children. Since we usually have only one chance to do it right, the guidelines for decision-making will hopefully come in handy as we invest ourselves in helping parents age well.",

        "content": "\"With the new year approaching, what are your thoughts about the past year and the upcoming new year?\"This question was asked of a sampling of aging women, whose introspective, candid responses offer insights into sadness, concerns, resignation and hopes. Some live independently in their homes; others in assisted living. While the contrast is understandable, it surprised me initially.\"It was a wonderful year because I kept well and mobile, which is important not only to exist, but to live. I hope I get through to another new year--the future can close in on you. Not everyone can live to be 100.\" (86)\"All I know is you have to hope and pray things will get better. The country is so torn apart. I try to live my life in such a way that I still am in charge and I'm still involved. But there's a certain amount of fear that I will lose this independence.\" (90's)\"Christmas (December) isn't the greatest time to be an older person. Cards come in from friends--some aren't well, then a card comes from only Jean--not Jean and Richard and I realize Richard had been ill and has obviously died.... There's a melancholy about the past--you have more memories than you have plans. You know certain things aren't practical, possible. Big chunks of things that make life happy aren't there any more...I push it out of my mind, telling myself how lucky I am...I must draw on the resources I have. So I look forward to the new year when things return to normal and I volunteer at the church and do another volunteer job. A big part of life is plans and future. Without plans, a date on a calendar doesn't mean anything.\" (early 80's)\"The world is---ugh! I don't like listening to the news. And lately I've heard of so many people I know falling. You don't know what's going to happen next.\" (89)\"It's not comfortable living in this world with all of its problems. Some nights I go to bed and don't want to wake up. Looking forward: I'm concerned about my children--will they remain close, how will they be after I go.\" (83)\"My husband is very ill.\" Looking forward: \"I'm hoping he passes away before I do because he couldn't handle things alone.\" (78)\"I feel like I've been put here by my children.\" Looking forward: \"I worry about my grandchildren's future...the kind of world it will be.\"\"I'm lucky I got this far (after serious health issues) and got to meet my new great- grandchild...and hope I'll be around to watch her grow next year. I'm feeling sorry for myself--I ended up here. I don't like feeling this way. Then I look at the picture of that beautiful baby and I'm glad I'm here.\" (86)As we make our New Year's resolutions, the above may provide ideas when thinking about helping our aging parents. There's uncertainty ahead as always, but perhaps more of it in today's world for both young and old....but then again, there's also hope. May 2012 be a good year for you and your aging parents as we try to help parents age well.(PS. The first 4 responses are from people living independently; the last 4 are from those in assisted living.)",

        "content": "Good organization obviously saves energy, time, friction. Clearly some people seem born as good organizers, while others??? Clearly aren't.Downsizing and moving involve daunting tasks--believe me, I know first hand right now. I've also always known my husband is an excellent organizer--much more disciplined than I (I'm more often propelled by instinct and inspiration).We are different personality types and have different ways of accomplishing things. And we both get them done, which is the point of this post. There is no right or wrong way if the goal is met.More specifically there is a well-known personality type \"test,\" the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator. There's no right or wrong answer. For example, if I ask you to raise your hand, some will raise the right hand, others the left. There's a preferred way for some (use the right hand) while for others it's the left hand. But neither way is better. We teach this in some depth to our 10th graders. You'll catch on quickly also.Without going into too much detail, I'll illustrate examples as they affect my husband's and my organization for this move. When people work well--and the same way--together everyone is on the same page and things should work well. But when people's way of organizing is radically different, needless friction can arise. Obviously if help is needed from someone who's never organized and who can never be counted on, a completely different strategy is called for.We're talking about behavior here and organizing for a common goal. Since I only have time to write in snip-its due to my current downsizing/moving situation, tomorrow I will present opposite organizational habits with equally successful results. The immediate goal is to help aging parents when they need to downsize or move. Understanding the way they effectively organize (or not) and the way we organize should help things go more smoothly.",

        "content": ".................And whose energy?A former colleague, Anna, now a current friend in her late 80's, phoned me yesterday to tell me she was going away for the weekend; she was also wondering how I was progressing with our downsizing.I enumerated the things I'd been doing and the fact that I was very tired at the end of the day. I started thinking about the impact of aging on one's energy.I remembered a lunch date with another former colleague, a year ago. Because she's almost 60, retirement was part of our discussion. And energy was a big part ofthatdiscussion.She's a master teacher and brilliant. She has published, has a stellar reputation and a devoted following of students. While she believes that she's an even better teacher than when she was younger, she is also aware that the energy you have at almost 60 isn't the energy you had at 50. Looking back we agreed that in your 40's you have a great deal of energy, definitely enough to spare.I've long held the notion most of us reach our peak in our 40's, remain at that level for quite a while. Yet, almost imperceptibly, energy begins to decline. We can easily compensate for it initially because we are older and wiser. But it finally catches up with us.Less than two years ago Anna and her husband downsized from a large home with over 50 years of accumulation to a good-sized apartment. Anna's mind is excellent, she swam daily until the house was sold and she remains interested in everything.Her many children and grandchildren were only too happy to help these aging parents/grandparents pack and move. But Anna tells me that, although she didn't have to be concerned with the physical part, the mental energy required was tiring. Even after showing younger people what needed to be done and how to do it, it often wasn't done just the way Anna wanted. So she did much of it herself.Can adult children argue with that? If we're creating additional mental stress while trying to be helpful and preserve older peoples' energy, are we helping? And how do we help in a way that respects everyone's wishes, time, and abilities? If we can answer that last question, we can offer our greater supply of energy, have grateful aging parents and grandparents, and feel good.But most of our parents (as well as ourselves) put off downsizing until we realize we aren't as able as we were and may not have the energy if we wait much longer. The earlier everyone starts, the better.Note, Boomers: Some children, who are old enough to care, could care less about their parents' treasures. Some parents--aging or not, moving or not--are giving things to their children, including old photos that may or may not be in albums. (The photos of course need identification if they're to have meaning. I think we all know the frustration of looking through an old family album lacking identification.)It takes a lot of energy and time to go through shelves and drawers, photos and folders of papers. If you're like me with deceased parents who kept everything--you not only have your things to evaluate, but must read and double check theirs before recycling one scrap of paper. Why? Because, for example, my parents haven't been gone long enough for me to legally shred everything.My almost 98-year-old mil, Sr. Advisor R, on the other hand, (recently recovered from her broken hip), is conscientiously tossing or giving \"stuff\" weekly. Her energy hasn't returned completely, but she is disciplined as I've written previously.Says she doesn't want us to be stuck with it.When aging parents aren't mentally capable, it's another story. But when they can do, if we didn't know how to help before, why not reread paragraphs 7, 8, and 9? Hopefully we can adapt the concepts, help our aging parents, help ourselves, and perhaps evenourchildren.",

        "content": "When parents need us, we are there--if we can possibly manage it and are committed to helping them age well. And so it is today, that a dear friend, Edie, was laid to rest in NY. She was almost 101 years old and she did age well.My day has slipped away from me and I will post on this blog tomorrow also. But tonight I want to take a few minutes to write a bit about Edie--a fine, can-do, petite woman I knew through the Woman's Club--who I grew to love and admire over the years. Then, using Edie's example, I want to add a bit about how family contributions help old/older people age well.You may have met Edie in previous posts: quoted for her wisdom about old peoples' driving and cited for her always-in-order, stylish appearance among other things. She was intelligent and well read, and her good eyesight enabled her to read, as well as write a note on a January letter to me (dictated to her daughter, who then printed it out so Edie could add the note) in her very legible, somewhat shaky, handwriting.While Edie lived here in NY all the time I knew her (with a daughter who has health issues and her daughter's husband), she was close to both daughters. A year ago around Mother's Day, Edie's far-away-living Tennessee daughter came to NY to take Edie back to live the rest of her years with her and her husband--a mutually-agreed-to move, from what I can tell.The far-away Tennessee-living daughter is Edie's youngest. She came to NY periodically. On those trips she and Edie shopped for clothes at Talbots--one of Edie's favorite stores and obviously another option for clothes suitable for old women. She also went to Edie's hairdresser's and left money to continue Edie's weekly hair appointments.We know how important hair is in looking \"put together.\" While clearly looks aren't everything, they are a major part of a first impression. And Edie's first impression was yes old, but well-groomed and nicely dressed. Additionally, the weekly hair appointment got Edie out of the house and into real life at the hair salon with all the gossip and friendly chatter that involves.Another plus was the fact that after she stopped driving at 90 something, another family member or friend drove her to the beauty salon each week. More contact with others, more socialization, more stimulation--all of which as we know helps people age well.Once in Tennessee, Edie's younger daughter, a teacher, became caregiver during her nonscheduled working hours. She arranged for someone to be at home with Edie during the day while at school.I'm sure many of us are familiar with the routine. We put our life on hold until the end of a long day and then take care of our own responsibilities. Papers needing to be graded awaited Edie's daughter at night. So once the night was hers, she began another kind of work. But she wouldn't have changed that for anything, she says.I began writing about old people and change in the last post. While change is difficult for most old people, Edie seems to be an exception. The fact that it was a mutually-agreed-upon change, was no doubt a big factor. Edie also liked the gentler pace of Tennessee.While Edie lived with her NY daughter and husband for many years, we all knew about her yearly trips (in her 90's) to Tennessee as well as to Texas and California to see her grown grandchildren. Shortly after arriving in Tennessee last summer, Edie's daughter and husband drove her to Texas to visit one granddaughter and her family. More stimulation, more social contact. \"Can you imagine we're driving all the way to Texas?\" she wrote me.Edie's was a life well lived. She was a member of that remarkable generation--widowed relatively young with two daughters, always upholding her end while moving everyone forward in the most graceful, positive way. And her family happily gave back, which was almost unnecessary until she approached 100 and finally needed them. What goes around, comes around.",

        "content": "\"Old people don't adjust to change well,\" says an 85-year-old friend, talking about her long-time friend who completely recovered from a stroke, is once again living independently, but has changed from a woman of strength and determination to someone who acts relatively helpless...a woman whose \"piercing intellect\" has softened.\"Illness can change people,\" she continues, \"I think it's the prospect of a change in their life--the prospect of not living life as they would like to.Yes. But that's just a piece. According to our senior advisor, psychiatrist Dr. Bud, \"it's not just the 'prospect.' It is change. It's a loss....Body integrity is involved here and there's a need to make compromises due to the loss. The loss itself can be a profound change andthere may be fewer options to replace the loss (ie. can no longer do daily exercises, walk any distance, play golf).....Anticipating loss in ourselves or in others isn't something we normally think about.\"So Dr. Bud gives us another tool to help parents age well when we understand the profound effect of loss that can accompany change in older people. We gain an important awareness that can increase our sensitivity and our ability to reach out and offer support.For example, Dr. Bud says \"it may be helpful to confirm that somethingislost, but not everything.\" Recognizing this may help a person to change--to reassess him or herself and his or her capacity for involvement in other things--or in doing things another way.*               *                *              *Throughout our lives we have heard about the importance of being a good listener. Having someone to talk to, not necessarily to gain advice from, but having someone who actively listens in a caring way, provides its own feedback.When people of any age feel free to express uncertainties and feelings in a supportive, nonjudgmental, not-telling-you-what- you-should-or-shouldn't-do-environment, options often become evident, solutions can appear. Clearly familymembers and friends, who are good listeners, play an important role in helping older people surmount the bumps in life that require changes. And that has to help aging parents continue to age well.",

We've been friends for years. I knew she had been using a computer for years and assumed (Sr. Advisor 97-year-old R has said more times than I can remember \"don't assume\" and I guess that goes doubly for older people) she was quite computer literate.She began our luncheon conversation telling me how she was thrilled with the new iPad her children had given her--so light weight and fast and enlarging images on the screen is easy. But she didn't know how to get my blog on it. Said her son had showed her certain things, but not how to get to my blog. So I asked a few questions:1. How did she get to my blog on her old computer? Answer: \"I pushed the button, it was in my favorites.\"2. I knew she e-mailed and asked what else she did on her computer? Answer: \"I look at pictures my children and grandchildren send me and I print some out.\"3. \"Anything else?\" I asked. Answer: \"I used to look up information but I don't any more.\"4. \"Do you write letters other than e-mail for people who don't have e-mail?\" I asked. \"No, I don't know how to do that. And the other thing I don't know how to do is print anything out on my new iPad.\"This woman has a mathematical mind and in her day was an outstanding science student at one of the top colleges in the country. She also plays bridge and comes in first more times than I can count. So I'm wondering why her computer usage is so limited. I think I know the answer. None of her children live near. The closest lives a 4-hour drive away and he has responsibilities that make it difficult to get away.\" He purchased the iPad (as a Mother's Day gift from him and his siblings) and set it up and I believe showed his mother some basics. But then he had to go back home. If you read Marti Weston's experiences with her dad and the iPad she bought him, you realize it takes more than one trip (see last Saturday's post) to help an aging parent really understand.I went to the Apple Store today after the workmen left and will summarize my iPod inquiry in an additional post I tomorrow.

        "content": "I'm sneaking in an extra post today--it's something I feel passionate about.I was at a Woman's Club program yesterday. We had tea and desserts after the program, seated at tables for four.The attendees were, at least, in their 60's--many in their 70's and 80's; some older. Two of the women at my table were in their 80's, one was 90--all widows, bright, alert, and with-it.Why would they need a computer? Why should they have a computer?One of the 80 something-year-olds said she used a computer when she worked, but never bought one after she retired.The subject underway when I joined the table was Bin Laden's killing by the Navy Seals. One woman's brother was an Annapolis grad way back; her husband had been a veteran. Another woman's husband was in the Pacific in WWII. I asked if they knew anything about benefits for Veteran's and their widows. Both women were clueless; their adult children should \"check this out,\" they said, \"but would they know what to do\" if I wrote down my blog \"address\" for them?That triggered thinking about the necessity of aging parents having and using a computer. Even R, at 97, has said many times that if she'd known at age 80 that she was going to live this long, she would have gotten a computer and learned how to use it.That said, I have friends in their 60's and 70's who drive a car without hesitation but don't use a computer. Some have one in the house (their husband's old one?) and access e-mail--when they think about it. For anything else, they ask their husband, adult children or grandchildren to do it. Some smugly say they'd rather talk to a person on the phone; and/or they prefer to write a letter....\"not as impersonal\" they think.But isn't that unfair? Unfair to impose on family members, and unfair to themselves because they miss out on a lot. Some of my high school classmates have died. Most of us hear by email. Yet a close h.s. friend who moved away \"put her late husband's computer in a box\" when she moved and proudly says she hasn't taken it out and doesn't plan to. Friends can update her about news on the phone, she says. They forget. She's misses out.Studies confirm connections with others are an important factor in aging well. Think connections, stimulation, exchanging information. A computer makes it possible.This replaces myusual Saturday post. I want to spend Saturdayfinding the simplest technology for using the internet and e-mail. When older people have and use that technology, an important ingredient is added to their lives--an ingredient that helps them age well.",

        "content": "Barron's,\"The Dow Jones Business and Financial Weekly,\" features \"Reviews & Previews\"--a 2-page spread each week. The \"Reviews\" page features short business-oriented snip-its, so I wassurprised to readthe following, butnot surprised bythe followingin a short column titled \"The Numbers\" (probably included because Mother's Day is this Sunday). I share it with you.\"Senior Helpers, an in-home care provider, found that elderly moms prefer to live with their daughters over their sons.70%: share of mothers with both sexes of children who prefer to live with their daughters.94%: share of parents who want to live independently as they age68%: share of mothers who say daughters will take better care of them as they age80%: parents who say their children will care for them as well as they care for their parents.\"Do you find it surprising that elderly mothers would prefer to live with daughters rather than sons (who probably come with a wife aka \"daughter-in-law\")? I don't. However, I'm fortunate to be married to an only child. His mother, R, is like a mother and she treats me like a daughter.Yet--and this is not surprising either--98% of parents want to live independently as they age. And this is true of R, who still lives in her home of 60+ years--actually is back, living independently in her home without help, after breaking her hip in late September and making an impressive recovery. (Her recovery is the subject of a January 25, 2011 post.)The fact that 68% of mothers say their daughters will take better care of them is also not surprising. We typically think \"women\" when we think \"caregivers\" but many men--prefer (my dad insisted on) \"male\" when thinking \"caregivers\" for themselves. Whether or not those \"males\" would include their sons is anyone's guess--probably depends on several factors including the son's wife.Lastly, isn't the 80% of parents who say their children will care for them as well as they care for their parents ambiguous as to quality of care? Does that mean if they don't do a good job of caring for their parents, their children--likewise--won't do a good job of caring for them--or vice versa?It's a fact that parents are strong role models for their children. And parents who helptheiraging parents are modeling this behavior for their children who, in turn, have better odds that they will help their parents as they age. If we believe in role models, or if we believe \"what goes around, comes around,\" it's all the more reason to help parents age well.Check out my other site:  blog, more information and resources",

        "content": "When Aging Parents Move and We Try to Help--Telephones!Will Our Telephone # Move Too?Unlike our cell numbers,hard-wired telephone numbers don't necessarily follow to a new residence--even when it's not very far from the previous residence. For aging parents, telephone numbers need to followfrom the \"get-go.\"Obvious? Perhaps. Under stressful conditions--perhaps not.Unintended consequences, are just that. We don't think about them until we're left with the damage control. And if we're responsible as we try to help aging parents, it's easy to become angry with ourselves for creating an additional problem that disappoints parents and can unnecessarily involve siblings.BackgroundAn 85-year-old relative recently moved from her condo to assisted living--not a move she initiated. Several months of worsening mobility problems and a series of hospitalizations jeopardized living alone.The last several years she and her 3 grown children had discussed the wisdom of moving. Friends in her condo complex had died or moved. And there was an attractive independent-living place nearby, making it easy to maintain her routines.My relative is smart, organized, active, loved her condo of 40+ years and hung on to her independence--through many serious health events. But last month her doctors advised she needed assisted--not independent--living.She gave in and asked her children to arrange for themove while she recovered in a hospital.What's a telephone got to do with it?To reiterate from past posts, connections to others is one of the 3 most important factors in healthy aging. And telephones provide a major way of connecting with others. Indeed older people may have their friends' numbers on automatic dial as memories fade.My relative's caring, efficient children notified the phone company to close her account immediately. It was an easy thing to cross off a long list. But then they realized she was issued a new phone number at the assisted-living facility, which had another provider. Friends couldn't contact her.Think about new phone numbers being a problem for aging parents and grandparents who downsize (and for their aging/old friends). If they remain in the same area of their city/town and stay with the same phone company it's more likely that the phone number won't change. Simply tell the phone company that although the address is changing, your parents want to keep the same #.1. However, do not notify the phone company to stop an aging/old parent's existing phone servicebeforeasking if they can transfer the old telephone number to the new address.Otherwise the existing phone number can be given away.2. Check out--ahead-- the phone system/provider at the new place.When an institution has its own system or a different phone provider, it may be best to ask the person in charge to take care of having your parents' old phone number transferred immediately if it's doable. This eliminates having aging parents who just changed living situations feel even more isolated because friends can't phone them.My relative's children report it was a hassle to get the old phone number back--took 3 weeks to accomplish. \"We were just lucky,\" they added. (It may not be this difficult everywhere.)It was simpler back in the day, when \"Reach out and touch someone\"was a well-known saying; when accessing a live human being on the other end of a business's line was the norm. Never-the-less we can prevent unintended consequences and, in the case of telephones, maintain that connectedness so important for older people's aging well. It doesn't take too much effort...when we know how.Visit my new site:   Same blog, more information  ",

        "content": "Holiday Thoughtfulnessand Aging ParentsA small bunny peaks out from under a flowered hat at bottom left of this gift basket, made by my friend. Wouldn't it bring joy to an aging parent or to a senior in a care facility?2011  Passover: April 18th-26th   Easter: April 24thWe celebrate miracles: The emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt, and the Exodus when the Red Sea parted. The Resurrection of Christ after the Crucifixion. Older generations fondly recall traditions that brought family members together: Passover with Seders and children looking for the hidden matzo; Easter with church services, children's Easter egg hunts, and a special Easter meal.The timing of Passover and Easter are inextricably linked. The Last Supper was a Passover Sedar.Holidays evoke warmth of family, feelings of togetherness. Yet we know holidays can be depressing for older people living alone, without children to visit or invitations to partake in family celebrations. On the other hand, opportunities for bringing pleasure to old and/or lonely people during Easter and Passover are many:Attending Easter services together, then......dining at a place with beautiful surroundings that make the outing special...going to a restaurant in town where aging parents who don't get out much can take a short walk (walker? wheelchair?), window shop,enjoy seeing normal activity\u2026having a meal at home with family--togetherness, conversation, participation ...When the Easter meal is at home and elders want to help, accept the offer. We know how good it feels to contribute.Ditto for Passover. One of our Senior Advisors says proudly that she made: chopped liver, matzo balls, gefilte fish, and horseradish for the Seder. Not easy at 89. She says she was able \"to work it out so I could make everything ahead.\" And best of all perhaps for her, \"It was a good feeling because everyone wanted to take some home and there wasn't anything left.\"Passover Sedars follow a prescribed ritual-- usually at home with family and often invited guests. Yet there wereno children to look for the traditional hidden matzo at a Sedar on the West Coast last year. What to do?Creative thinking perpetuated the tradition.The oldest guests were sent on the hunt. And an excited 86-year-old found the matzo. While not traditional, life today with children andgrandchildren living near is not the same as in times past. Adapting is the name of the game for holidays (and so much else).And last but not least, what about the frail, isolated elderly who can't get out easily? A visit is welcome and bringing little gifts, while unnecessary, is always a pick-me-up. Suggestions:Bring... a little lunch or snack (\"nothing big,\" I'm told) to share while you talk (consider dietary restrictions if known)\u2026 a few holiday decorated cookies or cupcakes...an easy-care living plant--possibilities: (philodendron [sweetheart plant], fern [nephrolepis], spathiphyllum [peace lilly--wallisi variety] or kalanchoe)...a flowering plant for a sunny indoor spot or patio...flowers\u2026Allergies a problem, what about a basket like the one above?Easter and Passover celebrate miracles. While we can't make miracles, planning ahead and giving older people something to look forward to is an additional gift--a gift that contributes to helping parents and elders age well, especially during holidays.Visit my other site--   Much more information on tabs",

        "content": "I was invited to write a guest blog for EPOCH Senior Living (EPOCH offers levels of living and care for seniors); and while I write few guest blogs, I liked the idea of this one. It was interesting to relate the new guidelines--which make sense in theory--to practice (the experience of a few older people I know). What follows comes from my blog post forEPOCH's blog.AGS/BGS Guidelinesshould lessen falls among the elderly. Yet they wouldn\u2019t have helped my husband\u2019s \u201cwith-it,\u201d 97-year-old mother, R, (the subject of my January \"falling, broken hip, complete recovery\" posts).When R fell, her health was very good (no heart, high blood pressure, etc. problems). She ate healthy, took calcium citrate+D, exercised and walked daily on a non-electric 1960\u2019s treadmill, powered by her feet.Guideline\u2019s-recommended Tai chi--confirmed in countless reputable studies to improve balance and help prevent falls, and now offered at many senior centers--may have prevented R\u2019s fall.I attended a class at our local senior center several years ago. Coincidently, the abrupt twist that caused R\u2019s fall was one focus of that class--practicing a gentle turn of legs and body, as opposed to twisting part of the body, which disturbs balance. (Isn\u2019t that what we instinctively do, for instance, when a phone or doorbell rings unexpectedly?)That said, driving to regular exercise classes is impossible for non-driving seniors like R. Obviously many needy seniors without transportation miss out on tai chi and other exercise classes.Becausefaulty vision can cause falls, in addition to regular vision check-ups,at least one New York U. Medical School faculty doctor recommends that his elderly patients have a night--light in their bedroom, especially if they read/work in bed and throw those materials on the floor before going to sleep. \u201cI warn older patients they can easily slip and break a bone (as some have) if they get up in the middle of the night and don't see them.\u201dOne sensible Guideline--\u201cEvaluation for gait and balance\u201d by doctorafter one fall\u2014may be easier said than done. Falls are often kept secret. An 87-year-old had many falls before one caused a broken hip. Her doctors discovered an imbalance that a simple device in one shoe remedied. Had she not been so secretive, after the first fall, her broken hip could have been prevented. The new assessment \u201cexamination of feet and footwear\u201d didn\u2019t exist then. It might have prevented her falls in the first place.An alert pendant/bracelet, while not preventing falls, would have saved R additional pain, from pulling her body 30 yards over 3 hours to a phone. Her badly bruised knees healed more slowly than her hip. How many seniors have, but don\u2019t wear, those pendants? R never thought she\u2019d need one because she took such good care of herself. Doesn\u2019t it make sense for elderly people, living alone, to have one? (Click linkfor some researched options.)Denial, keeping falls secret, and transportation difficulties can undermine even the best fall prevention efforts. We have the Guidelines, we know some of the problems, now it would seem that the challenge is for seniors\u2019 doctors, rational older people and their children to embrace them.",

        "content": "...And What Children Can Do to Help Their Aging Parents From Day 1Senior Advisor, R, has been out of the rehab facility for a little over a month, but returns twice a week for out-patient physical therapy. I took the opportunity to interview M, Director of Nursing, at this \"A\"rated facility, wanting to pose questions that I thought would help others.Admission advice?1. Have at-the-ready: ID, Medicare card, Insurance card. If a POA is involved, the facility needs it asap (within a few days).2. If parents come in an ambulance from another facility, all possessions that were in their previous room are transported to the facility.3. Because they are going to be up and dressed every day, they will need appropriate clothing (shoes, sweater etc.), personal care items, and all meds from home (including vitamins). As M says: \"Every pill.\"Then what?1. A doctor, following Medicare guidelines, will do an evaluation within 72 hours. It should be sooner than that unless the parents come in on a weekend--then it's a wait until Monday.2. Emotions can run high at this point. People need to understand that the skilled nursing staffing ratio is not the same as in a hospital (where it's probably 1-5). More likely it will be around 1-16. So expectations can be unrealistically high at the beginning.3. The doctor (who is there each week, but not each day) may only see the patient, after he/she is stable, once a month. However, the skilled nursing staff is the \"eyes and ears\" and regularly conveys patient information though telephone conversations to the doctor.4. That said, according to M, \"patients have more contact with the staff than in a hospital.\" I'm thinking probably because their needs are different.What additional information helps aging parents if shared?1. Knowing about parents' individual needs and routines --do they use a night light, have sleep apnea, unusual sleeping patterns (a farmer accustomed to getting up at 4am, for example will want an earlier breakfast if possible), are they incontinent etc, etc?2. In answer to my questioning as to whether certain personality types fared better, M gave me surprising information. \"If they've had anesthesia, they may be like a different person. Anesthesia is probably the most crippling for this population. It has to wear off and usually hasn't when they come to us.\"* * *    *       *  My experience: while Senior Advisor R was in the rehab facility, we realized communicating with the staff, when appropriate, got things done in a timely fashion, whether we or R initiated the discussion.R's take: upon admission to a rehab facility one must make a complete adjustment. One must accept the way things are. \"It's not like a hospital--not like having someone at your beck and call when you ring the call-button, says R,\" adding \"It's not real nursing (except for those who must have it). Asking the hardworking staff for more than one's entitled to only incurs frustration for both patients and attendants. Realizing this early, helps. Indeed some people make themselves miserable wanting more than the staff can provide.\" As we try to help parents age well, if a rehab facility should enter the picture, draw upon R's wisdom regarding the saying she learned in rehab: \"We're not here to help you, we're here to help you go home.\" That's the important thing to focus on,\" she says.Visit my other site:  blog, additional resources ",

        "content": "\"What should 97-year-old people eat to stay healthy?\"Who better to ask this question of than Sr. Advisor, R, whose broken hip recovery has been followed in my blog this year. While the following has worked for R, it may not work for everyone. Nevertheless, R. shared the following in a quick phone call.First, she eats \"very simply.\" Breakfast consists of oat meal or cheerios, with fat-free milk, fresh fruit, and sometimes toast--raisin bread, whole wheat or milti-grain (\"never white bread\"). She has 2-3 helpings of fresh fruit daily--sometimes berries or banana with her cereal and/or orange juice with pulp. (Note: frozen fruits and vegetables are frozen at their peak of perfection and are said to have the same nutritional value as fresh--and even more than fresh, if the fresh have been sitting around for a while.) Living in her own home and cooking for herself, she buys frozen dinners--\"Eating Right\" (a Safeway product), and \"Healthy Choice,\" (available at most grocery stores). She especially likes the large variety of dinners \"Eating Right\" offers. Since the dinners can be expensive, she looks for the sales; sometimes it's less expensive to buy 3 at a time, she says. It's comforting to know she has a supply in her freezer.She makes a green salad nightly to accompany dinner and ends with dessert. \"Eating Right\" makes 100 calorie ice cream in new flavors--an alternative to yogurt with fruit.Now we know R reads labels for calorie count. She also checks grams (g and mg.) of fat, cholesterol, sugar, sodium and fiber. While she has no problems that necessitate reduced sugar or salt, she \"never overdoes.\" That said, she loves candy, \"always has some in the house, but eats it in moderation-- 1-2 pieces, depending on size\".The frozen dinners, she says, may have too much sodium for people on sodium-restricted diets. She has always watched her salt intake because she knows salt isn't good for you, not because a doctor has said she should. So, for example, she prefers low-fat cheese because it's less rich (but also has less sodium and \"you get used to the taste\"), and lite mayonnaise.She eats a lot of fish; avoids rich and fatty food. (The frozen dinners she selects are no problem in this regard.) Even if she initially loves the taste, she has learned to avoid food that \"gives her discomfort\" after a meal, and that's the rich and fatty food...although she loves a good hamburger now and then. But that's the point, she says, \"once or twice--now and then\"--not as a regular diet.R never drank coffee, likes hot tea in cold weather, and drinks a lot of water. We know older people don't get as thirsty as young people, but still need to drink a lot of water daily to remain healthy (and give medications the best chance to do their job). Check with doctor for daily recommended number of 8 oz. glasses.We should know our parents dietary restrictions. Making certain aging parents get the nutrition they need is another way we help parents age well. So we may need to schedule a time to take them to the grocery store on a regular basis.

He had done it all--from fatalities at car crashes to transporting the very young and the very old. He was a big man; obviously strong. He also had a big heart and had been--and still is-- caregiver for his elderly aunt.\"Can adult children do anything to help aging parents needing to be transported by ambulance?\" I asked. His reply \"Yes, they need to stay calm and help their parents stay calm.\" And then he went on to elaborate on how difficult this can be. I share what I learned.People being transported in an ambulance are always scared, and often in pain. Fear of the unknown is usually great, although possibly less when one is being taken from the known of a hospital, as was R, to a rehab center where there's a specific program aimed at returning to normal mobility.The attendant said he does his best to calm patients and their families--makes it much easier for the professionals to do what is necessary for the patient as quickly as possible. When a patient is agitated, everything is more difficult and when family members add to the stress, it's doubly difficult.That said, he reinforced how scary it is for the patient. He shared that he had been in an auto accident and had been put in the ambulance. No matter the knowledge and experience he had, he was hurting and scared--mostly scared, he said, that because he was so big he might be dropped. He said he knew how well-trained everyone was, \"but when you're in pain and you've lost all control you become scared.\"We can help aging parents in this situation; but it's not easy.Visit my other site:   Same blog, more resources ",

        "content": "4 Common Mistakes We Make When Trying to Help Parents Age WellSome \"courtesies\" today may be considered good manners, but in fact don't help older people age well. They chip away at independence and work against physical fitness, so necessary for successful aging.I've become conscious of this since my 97-year-old mother-in-law (and Senior Advisor to my blog, R) has made a full recovery from her broken hip and is again living alone (with an alert pendant) in her home of 60+ years.She still goes to physical therapy twice a week, where she's being trained to walk confidently on her own--without cane. Surprisingly I realize my instincts weren't helping this goal.After spending 4 months in a rehab center doing physical therapy to strengthen muscles and regain her ability to walk, herhandicapped parking stickeris readily available. But why use it to park up close (except in emergency situations) when walking is excellent exercise for her?Nor do Iopen the car doorfor her any more. She was taught how to open a car door and get in properly--cane and all. It took hard work on her part to accomplish this. Do I reinforce independence or contribute toher muscle strength by opening the car door? or closing it?\"It's nice to let people do for you,\" says R, \"but pretty soon you get used to it and you begin to lose independence. And that happens with too many people. I've been watching it. Pretty soon they can't do for themselves what they really are capable of doing--and they lose a lot of their life.\"When/if this happens it lose-lose for everyone, except perhaps for assisted living facilities and 24/7 caregivers. Adult children must \"step up\" and fill in. Don't we want to avoid this as long as possible--if not forever?Are we helpful, when wehelp old people out of a chair?Ifthey can get up by themselves they exercise leg and arm muscles. Older people get up--unaided--more easily from a chair with a sturdy seat and sturdy arms. Every older person's home should have one--as should their children's.Fact: countless older people can't get off of the toilet due to weak leg and arm muscles. (Worry not--they've found raised seats in the catalogs and surgical supply places, but why help parents get into that situation?)When parents use a walkerbut are seated, for example at a restaurant, it's common to see well-meaning children pull them up from their seat. This deprives the walker-user from exercising arm and leg muscles, plus elderly people have thin skin--bruising can occur. We should stand firm, reach out and let the walker-using person grab our hands and pull him/herself up.What else isnothelpful? Basically--even with the best of intentions-- doing anything for aging parents that they can do for themselves.Also view my other site:  blog, additional features",

And this is one area--in our efforts to help aging parents--where adult children can make a significant contribution.When we do thoughtful things we help parents age well. Some of these things have an added bonus. Such is the case when we help older women and men to look better.Some older men (especially when there's no woman in their life), seem to let themselves go appearance-wise. Some may just be lazy. Or they mayfind it difficult to shave well due to eyesight or dexterity limitations. Or they may live alone and have difficulty getting to laundry facilities in a basement or elsewhere. Or if they can access laundry facilities, they may be clueless as to how to operate the machinery.Many of these conditions are correctable once noticed so adult children can provide remedies--by helping them get to a doctor or barber shop, by arranging for the laundry to be done, by teaching a willing aging father how to use a washing machine and dryer or by gifting a new, easier-to-use razor, an article of clothingand/or an appointment with a good barber.(Is a professional shave a gift idea?When Dad was in his final months I remember his delight when the caregiver gave him a shave in the morning, complete with a warm, damp towel.)While thoughtful overtures definitely bring pleasure, helping an aging parent look better offers 2 more potential benefits: improving strangers' reactions to him--be it at the grocery store, a new doctor's office, wherever; and getting compliments from people who know him and notice the change. All enhance self-esteem.Grooming and clothing-- can make a big difference.A clean-shaven man makes a good first impression. Stubble and that unshaven look tend to be vagrant-looking on most old/older/elderly men... unless of course your dad or grandfather has the looks off a Brad Pitt, Justin Timberlake.Hair loss, an issue for men, leads to some strange/creative hairstyles which a goodbarber should be able to restyle more suitably. Dad solved this problem with a hat to protect his balding head and avoid more skin cancer.Here, at 91, he's at my oldest, best friend's beach house. We stayed overnight reminiscing, with the priceless warmth countless years of friendship provide.While older men don't need fashionista clothing, it needs to be neat, clean,color coordinated and appropriate for the occasion.This 72-year-old, recuperating from major illness, had just come from physical therapy and was waiting for his wife. \"She'd kill me,\" he said, \"if she thought I was having my picture taken looking like this.\" But he's clean-shaven, his hair looks fine on this windy summer day, and his clothes are in order.Many elderly fathers have favorite clothing combinations that they wear again and again--like a uniform. Before everything wears out, what about taking dad shopping? Visit stores or websites--or surprise him with a gift of clothing that enhances his wardrobe. Sounds like a plan.Father's Day is less than 4 months away...but who's counting when we can help aging fathers/grandfathers in more ways than one with a single gesture.  ",

Big advantage to aging parents and college football: the Fax machine!The Wall Street Journalreports in a short front-page article \"InCollegeFootballRecruiting, The Star Player Is the Fax Machine\" (2/2/11). Readers learn the first Wednesday in February is \"signing day,\" the date when high school football recruits can officially finalize their college choice with a signed letter. To expedite the process the \"often ignored\" fax machine becomes the focus of anxious coaches as the signed letters roll in.\"I've never seen a bunch of grown men so worried about a fax machine, said the University of South Carolina's recruiting coordinator,\" (according to theWSJ).Of course! Fax machines are more affordable and easier to use than the newer technology that scans and sends, so \"everyone\" has access to them. Yet the fax's attributes are often overlooked when thinking about helping aging parents and older people who don't use current technology.How is it helpful?1. Health Issues: We can fax the doctor's office to inform of a health issue, asking for a fax or phone call back if we're asking a question (ie. Mom wouldn't take her medication. Says it's making her nauseated. What to do?)2. \"Heads up\" for doctors: Within 24 hours of an appointment, fax with specifics of reasons dad is coming in. Saves some precious time when we're there.3. Clarifying problem mail:Attimes parents have confusing bills or written notices. Once faxed to adult children, they can usually help untangle things to the point where parents can take care of the problem themselves. If not, the problem is not a surprise and children are \"ahead of the game\" when they need to intervene.You'll no doubt think of other uses for that old fax machine. Or perhaps you'll buy an inexpensive new one. As we try to help older people age well, maintain independence and confidence, isn't it important that we try not to do for an aging parent what he/she can do for him or herself --even if we can do it faster and easier?

Asincere compliment...spoken--or why not written on a Valentine?Older people and the elderly, in the three groups just mentioned, get relatively few compliments when compared with younger people. And isn't making people feel good what Valentine's Day is all about?Remember the Valentines with our names on them that were pulled out of the red decorated box in our grade/elementary school classrooms on February 14th? Of course the most popular kids got the most Valentines, but--possibly owing to a sensitive teacher--everyone in the class got at least one pretty Valentine with a nice message.I remember my 80-something-year-old grandmother would tell us--sometimes several times--about compliments she had received. And why not? It made her feel good, did something for her self-esteem and we kids would usually chime in in a way that confirmed the compliment and made her feel even better.Yesterday a lovely and sensitive friend, Carol, who I've known since college, sent me a note.In it she enclosed a note that my husband's mother (senior advisor, R) had recently written her from the rehab facility, thanking Carol for her Christmas card and wishes for a speedy recovery from her broken hip (described in my January posts).I phoned R, to read her Carol's note and the complimentary and fitting adjectives she used when writing about R. While R is truly an amazing woman (all my contemporaries say she's a role model), who gets many compliments at 97, I knew she was pleased when I read Carol's note over the phone. And then she said, \"And Carol sent me a Valentine....\" and I could hear how unexpected and pleased it made her feel.Almost all the really old (90+) people I sent Valentine's to over the past decade have died--the last one being Alberta, the wife of the WWII veteran (mentioned in my May posts about veteran's benefits), who died in her sleep last week. Edie--at 100--remains and I will e-mail her Valentine to her daughter's e-mail (she now lives with her daughter) in Tennessee.Sincere, not contrived, compliments make us all feel good. Perhaps the unexpected ones written on a Valentine make aging parents and the elderly feel especially goodas we strive to help parents age well.Visit my other site:  blog +",

        "content": "Rehab--Attitude and RealityA broken hip makes one helpless. Can't move, can't get up and do what you and I take for granted daily. Excellent doctor, successful surgery, excellent rehab facility. Yet as R lay flat on her back in a hospital bed after admission to the rehab center, we realized there would be \"down days\" and physically-challenging work ahead.The importance of attitudeloomed front and center. First concern--whether a proud, successfully independent 97-year-old woman would have the will to endure, and recover from, almost complete dependency accompanied by the pain remaining after surgery and accompanying the physical therapy.Control and Empowering:We couldn't control much, but wanted R to feel empowered, not like a helpless little old lady. She'd never considered herself that way, that would be so undermining. To this end, we immediately requested that the staff call her by her first name, never \"honey\" or \"sweety\" (or any other too familiar or what she might consider a diminishing pet name so commonly used in care facilities).Next, we asked R to give us orders--where to put things, what things she wanted us to bring her from home, what we could do to make the room more user friendly for her etc. etc. That gave her a smidge of control. Within a week, she also tried to control what little she could. \"Pick the dead leaves off that plant, she would instruct. \"I don't want to look at dead leaves,\" she'd emphasize.\" \"I don't want clutter in this room,\" she'd say. We complied with any \"orders\". Her mind worked well, we wouldn't interfere unless asked.Adjustment:The first week in an institutional setting is similar to a child's going to school for the first time: unfamiliar routines, new people, different food, expectations, surprising disappointments. When we don't feel good, we're weak, we lack energy and we're not mobile. We may not feel much like adjusting. We may be cranky or worse. Understandable, isn't it? Here's where focusing on the big picture helps.What's the goal?keeping the goal always in mind, helps dilute the disappointments, insults, temporary setbacks--equally applicable to help aging parentsandtheir children. The goal in R's case was to be able to walk again, have independence and not be confined to a wheelchair. But R had an intermediate goal because of her surgeon's instructions to the rehab center:\"no weight on the left leg for 90 days,\" then an X'ray to be certain the hip was healed, before regular walking could be added to her physical therapy routine.Patience:Unbeknownst to us, until she told us she had passed the half-way mark of 45 days, R was mentally crossing off the days until her return to the surgeon and X'ray--90 days.  ....to be continued",

        "content": "The Joy of Holiday LightsChristmas decorations make streets look festive and homes look welcoming. Especially at night, they can transform the ordinary into something uplifting and magical. In a world of unrest and uncertainty the colors and twinkling of the holiday lights on homes seem--in a way-- protective, signaling all is well within. And so it was comfortable for me to take a drive around my town last night to view the holiday lights.After a wonderful Christmas eve party that included many little ones, representing the 3rd and 4th generations of a 96-year-old and his 87-year-old wife, I decided to extend the festive feeling by taking a detour on the way home to see lighted Christmas decorations on streets I rarely travel.While the wonderful decorations are amateur, compared to the extravaganza we've seen in the Phoenix, Arizona area, they showcase the hard work and commitment of families to enhance their homes, yards, and neighborhood--a laudable goal under any circumstance.As I climbed out of my car into the black, frigid night to snap these pictures (wearing non-sensible shoes), I could glimpse party-goers within, hear dogs barking to signal a stranger approaching, and realize some home owners had turned in for the night but left their colored lights glowing warmly in the yard.Standing outside on the edge of their frozen property, I wondered if anyone realizedthe pleasure their displays provide. I wondered how many of us drive around to look at the lights; then wondered do we take our spouses and our children to enjoy the lights? Do we ever think of taking an aging parent, relative, or friend?I'm sharing some of last night's pictures here. (Click on photos to enlarge.)Perhaps you'll be inspired as I am--to take a senior out for a drive after dark--before the year ends and the decorations come down.After a certain age, many seniors don't drive at night. So here'a an opportunity to give them a change of scenery, to add interest to their lives--to contribute to helping parents, grandparents, and others age well.",

        "content": "The words and melody from the radio fill my car as I drive to the post office to mail the holiday cards. We have snow. It looks like a winter wonderland. And kids, amid shrieks of laughter and merriment, are sledding down our shared driveway on anything they can find that's large enough to sit on. Sun is shining, snow balls are flying, and I'm certain school vacation is adding to this happiest of times.Then my counseling background kicks in and I remember thatholidays aren't always the happiest of times for people. So I decide to check in with a few older people and see how they're doing.The consensusfrom my small sample--but there's nodisagreement: This is the haa, haa-py-est time of the year for children who have none of the responsibilitiesof adulthood, for newly marriedswho are lookingforward, and for young couples with children whostill believe in Santa.It's an especially happy time when older family members are geographically near enough to children and grandchildren so that they can gather together to celebrate and talk about shared past experiences. Meanwhile the excitement of the children in the family provides a background of energy and optimism.\"The holidays are a time when our mind drifts back to past Christmases that were happy times.It's a sentimental time,\"recalls one older widow.\"It's a wonderful time when families can get together, yet a lot of people are completely alone. As people get older, they have experienced losses. Especially for those who've lost their mates, other people's happiness can be a reminder of the losses we've incurred. We're just more vulnerable to that kind of thing when we get older.\"\"Unless there's a lot of family around and a lot going on, it's not the happiest time of the year. It's depressing,\" shares a 70-year-old man.There's agreement that it takes effort for older people to find this a happy time. \"It doesn't just happen,\" says one.\"It's what you make of it when you're older,\"says another.\"If you make the effort to be with people it's good, but it can be exhausting. We may continue to decorate and continue to write notes on the Christmas cards because we want our home to look festive and we like to get letters back after we write the notes. But we need to trim down and trim back so we aren't too tired to enjoy.\"So then I ask the question:How can younger people help?Canthey help?\"Stay in close contact with elders--aunts, uncles. Make sure they're not forgotten.\"\"A phone call even; it doesn't have to be a visit. I had a wonderful phone call from a far-away relative recently. You know older people dholidays,on't relate to an email as they do to a phone call.\"\"It's nice totake older people out to something, but take them to something that is rather quiet, that isn't too taxing an experience.\"OK, everyone. Why not pick up the phone and talk with at least one older person who lives alone or feels isolated. Brighten his or her day. Make these older people feel special, cared about...because they are. Raise their self-esteem. Add interest to their lives. Major studies confirm that connections are one of the most important factors in successful aging. It may not be the Haa, Haa-py-est time of the year for most older people, but we can make it better.",

A friend will drive her.\"It should be fun,\" I say.\"What's fun is to see my old friends,\" she replies. \"The hostess has been a good friend since grade school and she has this big party every year with friends, their children and grandchildren, who are now teenagers.Actually the younger generation plans most of it.\"\"What are you wearing?\" I ask.\"Don't know, will have to see what's in my closet,\" she replies.It's too late for her, but NorthStyle catalog(NorthStyle.com, 800-336-5666)has velvet drape-neck tops ((NA-133 in chocolate or black) with 3/4 length sleeves. For a woman who is physically able to put something with a wide-necked-opening over her hair without messing it up, they would look great over black slacks, pulled together with a jacket. Check out Copper Foil Jacket N4-707 (hand washable).Serengeti (SerengetiCatalog.com, 800-426-2852) is loaded with holiday and everyday wearable clothing...more than I can begin to name, so you need to check everything out! However, the silver-sequined zipper jacket & velour elasticized drawstring-waist pants set (W9-297) would be great for my former colleague to wear to the party tonight.Appleseeds (www.appleseeds.com800-767-6666) has the $79 black velvet jacket MQ1-61F (Misses) MQ1FP (Petite) that is a \"must-have\" for many--along with attractive pants, shirts, skirts, sweaters, jackets, coats, pant suits--you name it. Definitely check out Appleseeds. You may find something for yourself too!Lastly, aging/older/old dads. My dad liked to look \"sharp,\" he would say. But I could never figure out exactly what that meant or what to buy. His sister had cornered the pajama gift...at least one new pair a year.His favorite article of clothing in colder weather was awool knit, button-down-the-front sleeveless vest.When it was sunny, he wanted cotton long-sleeve shirts to protect his arms from skin cancer when outdoors. He also liked a nice zipper jacket (lightweight for summer, warm for winter), and slacks with an adjustable waistband.I found the latter (check out 130221 @ $99.50)in The Territory Ahead catalog, which is fairly pricey (territoryahead.com800-882-4323). Wool knit sleeveless cardigan vests were always fairly expensive but the ones in this catalog aren't the kind he liked. There is, however, a wide variety of zipper jackets. While marketed for much younger men, my dad in his 80's and 90's thought they were just fine--and on him, they were (in fact I still wear his gabardine one with jeans).Remembering parents' physical limitations and personal preferences (make certain flabby arms are covered), makes gifts of clothing more problematic. Yet if we subscribe to \"look good, feel better\" it can be worth it, especially for the holidays, as we try to help our parents age well.",

        "content": "Why Rational, Agreeable Aging Parents Can Turn Grumpy: 4 InsightsMy dad was extraordinarily independent. I knew that; but I didn't know how much he valued his independence until a respite weekend--just three nights and two days-- at \"the home\" was suggested.My brother (who lived with our father) wanted to go to the beach for the weekend. There was help during the days to cook lunch and dinner and clean up; my brother was there at night and it worked fine.Dad was a relatively healthy 90-something-year-old at the time who, every week, visited old friends at \"the home\" who lived in independent or assisted living. So you can imagine my brother's surprise when Dad vehemently rejected the idea, with so much emotion that my brother was taken aback.*              *               *                 *Currently R is living at the rehab center. No option initially. She needed to recover and move forward after surgery on her broken hip. This is her 47th day there; 97-year-old bones don't recover as fast as younger bones and she accepts this fact.Looking back over R's adjustment, I understand my Dad's emotional refusal and my mother-in-law's initial feelings. Thus I want to share insights that I believe are valid--for aging parents who value their independence and probably for most older people in general.Older people take pride in being independent. It sets them above the stereotype. It raises self-esteem and confirms capability.Older people don't welcome change; they're usually more comfortable and confident in known surroundings.When they must go to an institutional structure (unfamiliar routines and rules) they must adapt, which isn't always easy.Think: putting your child in kindergarten the first day. New people, new expectations, and to be successful adapting to the regimen and beginning to make new friends.The value of special support from adult children at these times certainly helps parents age well. Loss of control is scary. Normally pleasant people can become grumpy and demanding, if not depressed. Needing to navigate new turf with new ground rules can prove daunting, especially when older people feel helpless and are dependent. As they gain and feel more control (know the nurses, adapt to the routine, understand that it isn't going to be like home) things do improve.",

Squeezing things in and omitting and prioritizing take on new importance. This is my life at the moment.I flew out to be with senior advisor R, my 97-year-old mother-in law, who has just spent day 45 in rehab. \"They\" (whoever that is) say it takes 90 days before older people's hips have healed /mended or whatever enough to be able to put weight on the hip. That means 45 more days at the rehab center and R is crossing off each one.The physical therapy is excellent, which is the reason we selected this place. It is convenient to her home, several thousand miles from ours, but not from where we stay when we're here. However, we must drive over an hour daily--which is the reason I just came out again.

I realized that Mother, recovering from a stroke, was not conscientious about doing her physical therapy exercises at home. For one thing, she needed to walk more.Being a far-away living child, I wanted to make the most of my time with her. My suggestions only made her feel less adequate. I wanted to empower. What better than a short outing to Nordstroms? We'd have fun. She'dhave to walk.Underway and armed with handicapped tag (and walker just in case), I felt tension thinking about the availability of a handicapped parking space.

The primary purpose of this outing is for Mother to walk more...I'm trying to help an aging parent, not trying to park as close as I can which limits her walking.\"When parents can--and need to--walk more, doesn't it make sense to avoid the handicapped space? Of course we needn't park blocks away--but we know our parents, we can guage their capability (if uncertain check with doctor) and gradually increase it.Walking--as we know--is a best exercise and costs nothing (unless we do a lot of shopping).If parents need the stability of your arm, check out the dignified, preferred way of doing this in myAugust 21st post.And of course shopping carts at the big box stores, grocery stores etc. provide the stability to make walking easy for older parents.Bottom line: skip the handicapped spaces, unless there's a good reason to use them.

        "content": "Halloween comes just before the elections this year. And aging parents, whether blue, red, white, green, purple or whatever, no doubt have some pre-election angst like everyone else. So an unexpected, decorated pumpkin may lift the spirits, even when older parents are the bobbing-for-apples, trying-to-ride-a-broomstick type.Since it's almost Halloween, prices will be very low. Pumpkins need not have a perfect shape--in fact the larger pumpkin is quite lopsided. You only need a big skewer, a thiner turkey skewer (to poke holes for the tender stems), whatever you have in the garden, something to cut it with, and a glue gun. The entire process (minus pumpkin purchasing) takes about 15 minutes. If you find a creature on sale (pharmacies are no doubt the best bet now--probably near the candy section...at least that's where I found the little scarecrows today), glue-gun it on the top. Then use your creativity. I bought a plant at Trader Joe's with the larger of the chrysanthemums, then cut two blooms from the center for the larger pumpkin. The plant looks undisturbed--perfect on an end table in the house .After decorating the first pumpkin two years ago, I was told that the flowers actually lasted as long as some bouquets (because of the moisture trapped inside the pumpkin). It was so much easier than carving a pumpkin--at least for me--and the old couple I took it to (as well as their caregiver and daughter) still talk about it.I'm off to take them the larger pumpkin.

In answer to the secret of the 99-year's longevity, the role of genetics is discussed. (They play a part. According to one geneticist, centenarians are 20 times more likely than the average person to have a long-lived relative. But genetics is only about 20-30% according to a Swedish identical twin study. \"Lifestyle seems to be the more dominant factor.\")The 99-year-old thinks it's \"attitude\" and cites three critical elements: resolution, resourcefulness and resilience. She also gets regular exercise, eats carefully, and follows her doctor's advice. (See audio slide show online atnytimes.com/healthand click on each photo to hear interview.)My thoughts immediately shifted to senior advisor R, 97, now in rehab and making progress after her fall and resulting broken hip 3 weeks ago. These same qualities have guided her disciplined life. R has said many times she doesn't know why she has lived this long, but as long as she's alive she's going to do her best to make the best of it.Coincidently, last week our local paper featured a remarkable 99-year-old who spoke at a fundraiser--a former journalist who, in her younger days, interviewed Arctic explorers; arranged and escorted a secret mission that brought 1,000 Jewish war refugees to the US; covered the Nuremberg trials and was appointed a special assistant to Interior Secretary Harold Ickes during the Roosevelt Administration, among other accomplishments. Although she hobbled to the front of the room [to the podium], using a walker, \"her mind was sharp, her words perhaps a bit slow, but moving and clear,\" according to the reporter.As parents live longer, we try to help them age well. People who achieve \"extreme longevity,\" may have something intrinsic--resolution, resourcefulness, resilience, attitude, the discipline to exercise and eat carefully and follow doctors' advice\u2026.Perhaps the best we can do is remain caring, supportive, nonjudgmental sons and daughters, help when asked and be there for them as necessitated by health events. And make certain when we make suggestions about their life style, decisions, needs and values that these suggestions make it better for them, not easier for us.",

        "content": "Downsizing? Moving to assisted living or a nursing home?How to best accomplished this as we try to help parents age well.As we would expect, independent-living parents whodecide by themselvesto make a move, leads to the best outcome. They maintain control. They decide when and where and have full responsibility. This doesn't mean adult children play no part. They can can \"weigh in\"when asked, but don't run the show. Suggestions may be particularly helpful to--and welcomed by--aging parents who move to be nearer their children and grandchildren.\"Partnering\" is a popular concept. Whilepartnering with older parentsto make this kind of decision sounds fine, it's tricky. If children badger parents enough, chances are older parents lose the will to argue and give in to something they really don't want. Result: if parents are unhappy, children end up with additional problems and wonder why parents agreed to the move in the first place.This is undoubtedly why some unhappy, independent aging parents who may need a bit of help, have checked themselves out of assisted living, returned to living independently and figured out how to get the help they need.Keeping independent-type parents' homes unsold/unrenteduntil parents are comfortably and happily settled, prevents their being \"trapped\" in a possibly unhappy living situation. It's a good solution, when affordable. Check out mypost about Rodney's sobering--but true--story.Yetsome older people thrivein assisted living. They may have friends there. They may have felt isolated living alone and enjoy the socialization; or in the case of a friend's mother (whose husband dominated when alive), she loved the \"assisted part\"--prepared meals, amenities, the activities-- she was like a bird let out of a cage.The biggest challenge: older parents who resist moving, but need to move because their needs can not be met otherwise. Given the situation, their doctor may be in the best position to explain to why moving is necessary. Getting help from a geriatric social worker, who has helped families deal with this problem countless times, is another good option. Ifthere's a threat to life and limb, sometimes there's no choice: we do what's necessary in a caring way that won't leave us with unnecessary guilt.When we do our best to help aging parents, don't we ultimately help ourselves? As we deal with these issues, two thoughts are worth keeping in mind:1. IS IT BETTER FOR OUR PARENTS OR BETTER FOR US?and2. IS IT BETTER FOR OUR PARENTS TO DO \"X\" AND LIVE LONGER, UNHAPPILYORDO \"Y\" AND LIVE POSSIBLY LESS LONG, BUT HAPPIER?",

        "content": "When  there's a serious medical emergency it's probably safe to say few aging parents live near a hospital specializing in whatever caused the emergency.  Most of us--even those who live near and help aging parents--don't know the particular specialties at hospitals located nearby. A sudden emergency may leave little time to do the homework.Three no doubt common scenarios follow, involving different situations and actions taken.   All happened in my family; all caused great concern; all turned out well. All present strategies to help parents age well.#1--Mother's stroke experience: initially memorable for the emotional stress; equally memorable for the relief and sense of some control we felt, once we found out--and got her to a place-- where she could obtain appropriate treatment.It began with phone call. Parents in California for the winter. Mother's speech sounded \"funny.\"  Phoned my brother with concerns and a plea to fly to California immediately if possible (he was moving into a new home that day).  He got there quickly, phoned saying Mother was on her way to the hospital. I should fly out asap.When I arrived at Mother's bedside her speech was still garbled. Dinner was on a tray. She was eating the food with her hands. I've forgotten other details. A  terrific nurse updated me and said Mother's physician would be in early the next morning with test results. We learned they had limited the \"damage;\" there was nothing more they could do. Mother could go home later that day or the next with a caregiver, or go to a nursing home.  Dad would be unable to manage her care alone... a nursing home would be in inevitable at some point.I knew I needed time to think. Decided I wouldn't get a caregiver for that day. Knew Mother was safe spending another night in the hospital.  I called a NY friend knowledgeable about medicine.  After some research, he phoned back. He said to get her out of that hospital, which lacked neurology expertise, and to a neurologist at UCLA asap, and gave me a phone number.  With great difficulty I got an out-patient appointment for the next day.The next morning we picked Mother up at the hospital and drove to UCLA with films and reports. UCLA had newer technology. New films were taken. The extent of the damage was clearly pin-pointed and Mother was given different medications, a prescription for physical therapy, and an appointment to return in a month.There have been many advances in stroke treatment since.  I know Mother benefited from some because the neurologist said some were not widely used yet.  I also know: a month later the improvement was so dramatic most people wouldn't have known she'd had a stroke. Nor did she have any further strokes.*             *            *#2.  A family member, also living in the west, was diagnosed with colon cancer there... advanced: stage 3--maybe close to 4. Treatment was about to begin. \"Not there,\" said my husband, who wanted to check Sloan-Kettering and knew we could be supportive if the family member came back.  Indeed Sloan-Kettering had top colon cancer people. Convincing someone to come all the way to NY, however, isn't easy.  It's easier when offered as \"leaving no stone unturned\"--making the trip to get a second opinion. That works.While chronic health issues complicated things, Sloan-Kettering took charge: a top oncologist; an 8+ hour surgery performed by a top surgeon (who had done this countless times); a while to recuperate in NY.  Instructions for additional \"whatever\" were given to the doctors in the west. Routine check-up visits show the surgery was a success.....and we think insurance covered everything.*                 *                 *#3. Then there was Dad's \"heart event\" in California shortly after his 76th birthday.  At the movies he began feeling dizzy.  He went to the theater lobby and sat down on the floor.  One of the personnel came over to see if he was alright.  He wasn't; his blood pressure was low. Paramedics were called. He was taken to the hospital where his internist practiced.  While it wasn't the right hospital for my mother, it had a first-rate heart team whose surgeon did heart surgery on a former president a few years later. Dad had 5 bypasses on a Friday and went home the next Wednesday.  He aged well, lived to be 94, and his death was not heart-related.So how do we generalize? When helping aging parents is a part of our life and our parents live long enough, the odds of serious medical problems necessitating hospitalization are great. Getting parents to a hospital with the appropriate highly experienced specialists, can up the odds for a successful result that helps parents continue to age well...and medical insurance may make it more affordable than one might think.

        "content": "Following up....Yes, male aides or caregivers--because of their physical strength,  do help aging parents--men especially--to feel more confident and secure, according to one currently hospitalized grandfather in his 70's.  His take: the nurturing and gentle nature that female nurses provide in a hospital setting is wonderful--\"kind of like a mother\" and very much appreciated after serious major surgery in his case. And he never gave a second thought to \"privacy\" issues when being bathed.On the other hand, this grandfather was quick to mention the very attractive blonde woman--a \"Fellow\" who was part of the surgeon's team that visited him each day--as well as the attractive and very able physical therapist.This reminded me of my father's emergency quintuple bypass surgery in southern California when he was 76.  The heart surgeon (who a few years later had among his patients a former president of the United States) had put together a highly experienced team of good looking men and very pretty women.  Prior to surgery, patients received a small booklet with photos--explaining each team member's background and hobbies.My unmarried brother's spirits picked up when he met a very beautiful team member and I remember saying to my brother something like: Dr. X's patients aren't going to die--the men are going to want to see the women team members again and the women are going to want to wake up and see the handsome men.No doubt it was the surgeon's skill, but the team had to be an asset.  It not only helped aging parents to feel better about the situation (Mom and Dad), but it gave us all something to talk about which diverted our minds from a serious situation. And Dad lived to be 94.       *              *                 *Today I also heard from an 86-year-old woman who said she needed to tell me that the lighted pocket  is the best for older people. She has vision problems and uses it daily--many times.  As stated in an earlier Mother's Day Gifts post, it truly helps parents age well and at $9.99 how can you go wrong?As we try to help aging parents, hearing your thoughts and being able to pass them on to others through this blog, helps us reach our goal--to help parent age well.

I devoted myself to their needs,\" says a 60-year-old married daughter who had three  teenagers and an important volunteer job at the time. \"For over a decade their  commitments and evening social engagements took precedence over plans my  husband and I had as well as my friends...In retrospect, I gave up a  lot.\"  This is the extreme, of course. Her parents remained  connected and engaged, aged well, lived long lives, and she was at their  \"beck and call\" until the end.\r\rBeing engaged and connecting with people is important--we know that . To that end we've spent untold hours providing opportunities for our children. Think: hours spent car pooling and driving back and forth to various activities and birthday parties when children needed a driver? We make these efforts to help children age well. Should we make the same effort to help parents age well? Some do.\r\rMost of us don't make such a sacrifice. The dedicated daughter's parents never had the chance to become couch potatoes.  But what about those who are at risk or have already slipped into that mode? It's frustrating...\r\r... But summer presents additional opportunities to jump-start aging parents, assuming they can walk--unaided or with walker or cane...and go for a ride. Even a wheel chair works in most instances. Usually this doesn't entail a huge commitment from adult children and most aging parents want to get out for something they will enjoy.  \r\rIf they don't, don't be disappointed. It happens. Just plant the idea and let it \"gel.\"  Then try again later. It may make them feel good just knowing that you care enough to try and try again. \rTo begin: Set aside enough time so this isn't a \"rush job.\"  Time is in such short supply for us, but often hangs heavy on older people plus, they move slower. If they're going to feel this is an imposition--older people have pride and many won't want to impose--forget it.Plan with them (including them shows respect and gives them something new to think about) or give them options to choose from.  For those who don't get out much (except to go to doctors), \"short and sweet\" may be best.  You can judge that based on your comfort level and theirs.

Time, your parent's strength, the activity, and your tolerance are the keys to success.  And, if successful, planning for the next time gives aging parents something to look forward to.  Senior advisor, R, calls that a \"carrot.\"  And, according to her, \"carrots\" are extremely important to older people and definitely help parents age well.\r  \r\r\r\r",

It just was impractical.  In addition--\rMother was alive for all but 4 Father's Days so my parents and brother celebrated the day together, often with relatives on my father's side of the family.\rAfter Mother died, my father spent Father's Day with my brother.  They had a ritual of going out to breakfast together at the Hilton Hotel many Sunday mornings; Father's Day was no exception--except that they also went to an older cousin's for dinner.  She considered my father like a father, not an uncle. Her father died when she was young and my dad stepped in where he was needed to help his sister and her two daughters (one being this cousin).    It never occurred to me to check whether or not this was convenient for my brother--he never complained; I thought he enjoyed it.  Nevertheless having heard Francine Russo, author of the recently-published They're Your Parents Too!, discuss her book at a gathering two weeks ago, I found myself having questions--questions about how my brother felt about being the child who was there and my being so far away, even though I assumed major responsibility for orchestrating my parents' care with them as they grew old. So I telephoned today to check out the Father's Day \"obligation\" and was glad to find my perception was correct.\r\rFortunately my counseling training kicked in well over a decade before my parents had health issues.  In my head I had loosely carved out a plan of action for when the time came.  Why?

He told me the best place to have an evaluation and said, just like someone needing a hip replacement, I'd know when the time was right. So I had the evaluation recently--two years later.\" M, age 80+\r*              *             *\r\rHelp Parents Age Well offers something special. An advisory panel of stellar seniors with \"smarts\" and good, common sense that have served them well as they do their best to age well. They live in several parts of the United States, have at least one adult child (many of whom have spouses), and they'll share thoughts with you and participate in answering your questions in the weeks ahead.\r\rAll senior advisors are at least 80 years old; possess a good understanding of themselves, and were selected because of their sensitivity to the challenges of aging, their ability to meet those challenges and their ability to express themselves.\r\rA weekly check with my advisors reviews ideas for the weekly posts. When I first contacted M about hearing loss, she informed me she just got a hearing aid. She knows first hand; it's all fresh in her mind. So I introduce her today, and will continue to introduce at least one advisor each month.\r\rKNOWLEDGE COMES, BUT WISDOM LINGERS\rInscription over a gate on the campus of Scripps College, Claremont California* * *\rMeet M. She has been widowed 11 years and had two sons. One son died unexpectedly after finishing college and becoming engaged--two years before the death of her husband. She has one married son, who lives less than an hour away.\rM was a stay-at-home mom, helped her mother (who died at 108) to age well, and had a responsible office position at a company's headquarters while her boys were in college. Since her husband died, she has been involved in volunteer work, was president of a club of 300+ women and today handles rentals for the historic building that houses that club.\rM's hearing aid experience \rNot good! \"Initially the hearing aids were so uncomfortable I pulled them out while driving--after leaving the audiologist's...and managed to drop one of the tiny batteries on the floor. They aren't that easy to see and find! I was so discouraged and thought what a waste of thousands of dollars.\rI probably would have gone home like so many people do--and put them in a drawer and never looked at them again, except for the fact that they gave me an appointment for two weeks later. (It was included in the price.) But I left them in a drawer until two days before the scheduled appointment and decided I'd better try them. They didn't seem to fit well--felt lose, were uncomfortable, and my ears itched.\"\rPerseverance! \"I might not have persevered if the audiologist hadn't been persistent and encouraging, making an adjustment, and giving me some pointers along with another appointment (again included in the price). I felt I would have to give an accounting of myself in two weeks so I wore them but still wasn't convinced. I learned I wasn't putting the batteries in correctly at the next appointment, and then--\"\rAmazing! \"I left the audiologist's after the third appointment to attend a meeting when I realized I was hearing everything! I didn't have to pretend laughing when people laughed at something I couldn't hear; I didn't have to be embarrassed to ask someone to repeat something. I was used to piecing a conversation together as well as I could and maybe missed 10-15%. Now I hear it all.\"\rEnd Result: \"I no longer must turn the TV volume up so loud that I worry about my neighbors complaining. It took three additional appointments, but I'm used to the hearing aids and I'm no longer aware of what I call 'exaggerated sounds' that I heard in the beginning--things that sounded weird-- like the rustle of tissue paper or water running. I'm very pleased at this point and I give credit to the encouragement of the audiologist.\"\rTHE BIG QUESTION: Why do people resist hearing aids?\r\"Certainly because they take time to get used to and they must be cleaned and batteries must be put in correctly and replaced when necessary.But also hearing aids--unlike glasses--are a symbol of old age--like a cane. And many older people's vanity gets in the way.\rYou know it takes wisdom to start using a cane, and it takes wisdom to know when you should start using a hearing aid.\"\rM reminds adult children:--\"Old people can become very stubborn about certain things.\" Translated: if you've mentioned a hearing aid to a parent once, continued suggestions probably won't help (unless it's a suggestion from a doctor).\r--\"If you're asked to repeat something, repeat slowly--not louder.\"--\"The tone of voice that accompanies talking loud, can be easily mistaken for impatience.\"--\"Try not to convey impatience to your parents.\"\rPS. M also mentioned the fact that men may be more resistant to hearing aids because they usually don't have hair, like women, that hides  their ears and thus, their hearing aid.\r\r\r\r\r\r  \r\r\r\r\r\r",

        "content": "\"What did you say?\"  \"I just told you.......\"   Does this snip-it of conversation with an aging parent sound familiar?  And if it does, is there anything wrong with it?We know that hearing loss may be a normal part of aging; but not all older people suffer (and I do mean suffer) from it.  Mother could hear a pin drop right up until she died less than two weeks short of her 89th birthday. My dad, on the other hand, wore his hearing aid when he felt like it. Yet as both were--I guess you could say literally on their deathbeds (that sounds rather awful, doesn't it)--I was told \"hearing is the last to go.\" Thus, we were all careful about what was said in their presence.Currently my 18+ year-old cat, who sees probably  better than I, has almost total hearing loss. It seemed to come about quite suddenly.  I wonder how it mirrors the human experience.  She, a stray, no longer hears nor comes running when called; she loved being outdoors but not any longer unless someone is out there with her; and she's often scared when we apparently sneak up on her. So we have great patience with her; perhaps because she never asks \"What did you say?\" and we never need to repeat.As we try to help parents age well, we try not to diminish or demean by saying something--or saying something in a way--that makes them feel bad. Obviously!   And yet--An 80-year old mother pointed out that her perfectly wonderful daughter had a habit of responding to the ubiquitious \"What did you say?\"  with a bit of impatience in her voice (which made her mother feel bad) as she repeated whatever it was she initially said. So, for starters, when repetition is requested it may make sense to think carefully about how we respond.  Who knows--that old saying \"it's not what you say, it's how you say it\" might possibly be applicable.Tuesday's post will make use of my counselor training with suggestions for responding to an aging parent who isn't hearing well or isn't using an already-purchased hearing aid; followed by tips for helping parents age well by doing what's necessary to confront and combat hearing loss.",

I guess a goat, given in mom's honor as a Mother's Day gift, isn't as popular as I thought it would be...But I was heartened by one email reinforcing the value and popularity of supporting Heifer International's work throughout the world. I also like the idea that there's a colorful gift card that's downloadable after making a donation.  Thus, a last-minute donation to honor someone, doesn't necessitate scrambling for an appropriate card. But I don't know how many clicked on the link to learn that.Next I went grocery shopping. Trader Joe's featured a \"bouquet in a box\" --roses, lillies, gerber daisies, small pom pom mums, and two stems of  daisy-type flowers in a complimentary-color, plaid, box-shaped, waterproof bag for $12.99.  Really pretty!  You felt good just looking at it.  Bought one; took it  home with the groceries; then inspected it and took it apart to get leaves out of the water as they disintegrate and make the water bad.  So I cut off leaves, recut stems, put in fresh water, then decided to take it to 99-year-old Edie, who's fragile, but \"with it.\"She's the \"Edie\" featured in my book and her words of wisdom are in past posts. I heard she had fallen a while back.  Went to her daughter's home to find out I'd missed her by 15 minutes. She was on her way to the airport with her other daughter, who lives in the south.  And she will be living with that daughter from now on.I have her phone number, I will phone tomorrow. I will--no doubt--never see her again.  Am I feeling a bit dismal? No.  I have a very pretty bouquet in a box that I will enjoy on Mother's Day and beyond. And I will speak with Edie tomorrow and wish her a happy Mother's Day.  And I will ask if she'd like a goat--or a share of a goat--donated in her honor to help raise a family out of poverty.  I think she will.",

Later that day, looking at my schedule for the following week, I was reminded that D's birthday was Wednesday.....A  chance to check out reactions to this gift idea that I think can add quality to life--and thus our efforts to help parents and older friends age well.We went to lunch and D opened the small package before the menus came.  I knew she had vision problems; what I didn't know was that it was her 88th birthday.  She phoned me later to say \"thank you\" and followed the phone call with a written note the next day. It provides some insights and says in part:\"Good friends become more and more important as years go on--I didn't think I needed anything--but you found the perfect present.\"D used the magnifier to read the main menu and dessert menu.  A waiter  came to take dessert orders and I asked if he needed a Mother's Day gift idea for a mother or grandmother.  He told us his mother was in her 80's, had vision issues, he knew that a Container Store was located near his home, and he was going there after work. Another waiter joined the conversation.  Same reaction.A few days later another Mother's Day gift suggestion came from a friend: A traditional picture frame with a picture of the entire family/families--all the children (and spouses if any) and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  It's nice to have the whole family inside one frame, it seems.  This caused me to ask about the new frames enabled by technology.  One former stock broker in her mid-late 60's said her children gave her one that \"has never been out of the box.\" A capable computer-user, she just didn't want to be bothered downloading.Which brings up the point that at a certain age, many people just don't want to be bothered with gifts involving unfamiliar technology.....even when they've used a computer at work for the better part of their life. So it would make sense to check it out with parents beforehand. If they're comfortable, go for It. If not, hopefully ideas from the last three posts are helpful.As we try to help parents age well, check out the lighted pocket magnifying glass and-- if there's still time get every family member together-- you could arrange to have a family photo taken to put in a nice traditional frame.**********I'm interested to know which gift ideas you like best.

        "content": ".....Dilemma or Delight?May 9th is Mother's Day this year, so timely suggestions as we try to help parents age well make sense. Yet thinking about how to celebrate the day with older mothers can prove challenging; or perhaps not.Proximity of mothers and mothers-in-law is a factor.When both live within driving distance--One of my senior advisers, M,  says she lives more than an hour away from her son's wife's mother. \"Standing on their heads like a contortionist to be with both of us on Mother's Day doesn't make sense,\" she says. She suggests alternating years when adult children in this situation take their mothers out on Mother's Day. \"A nice card and plans for another time we can be  together (even the Saturday before) is fine.\" But in her case, she says, \"they shouldn't worry about it.\"D remembers well that she didn't have the dilemma, but her brother did. Both his mother and his wife's mother wanted their adult children with them on Mother's Day. While the mothers were within driving distance--they lacked a cozy relationship...didn't want to be together. So D's brother and wife had to make two long drives together in order to see both mothers.There really was no other choice, I'm told. Needless to say, D's brother and his wife were weary by the time they saw his mother. Never-the-less, each mother got her wish.  Children often sacrifice for the sake of a parent!Then, of course, mothers often have more than one child.  So if each child celebrates on a different day, the mother gets double rewards.  In fact, D suggests Saturday can be preferable because places aren't as crowded and staff can pay more attention to making the outing special.Adult children with siblings who live near mothers can work out plans that benefit everyone if people are flexible.  Indeed, D even suggests--perhaps in jest--\"Mother's Weekend\" instead of \"Mother's Day.\" And thinking about today's blended and extended families, there may be some wisdom in this idea.My husband and I are far-away living children, so the preceding never affected us.  I have a sibling (who lived near my parents); my husband has none. Up until last year R, my mother-in law (now 96), flew East to spend Mother's Day with us.  It coincided, more or less, with the Spring Flower Show at our local Woman's Club, which has a membership tending towards \"older\" women--primarily 55+, with a fair number in their 80's and 90's, so R and some of the women enjoyed a commonality.We sent R a ticket, she stayed with us, and the flower show was a highlight--along with our being together for a week. We had a solution for the proximity problem and gift dilemma--which lasted over three decades.Mother's Day gifts are the subject of this coming Saturday's post.Reminder:  to contact me use the gmail address at the right, not the \"Comments\" box below.",

        "content": "We change the focus a bit today--old grandparents, instead of aging parents.  But the situation is, I think, generic and applicable to either generation as we try to help them to age well.I was with a former colleague this week.  We began with the usual \"how are you\" to which he replied: \"I'm really tired.  I had such a hard night last night--couldn't sleep.  My grandmother's in the hospital.\"   (My first thought was that she was dying...but no. In all probability she was going home the next day.)Our conversation continued. I learned he and his mother had visited his 92-year-old grandmother the night before.  She asked for a glass of water with ice, which his mother left the room to get.  When she returned, she gave the glass to her mother who complained there was too much ice and too much water.Wanting to be helpful, her grandson (my former colleague), tossed some of the ice in the waste basket and took some gulps of water to reduce the water level, whereupon his grandmother criticized him saying something like \"I don't want a glass you've put your lips to.\"My former colleague said he was puzzled, hurt (to say the least). Then elaborated:  \"I'm her favorite grandchild, I'm the oldest. Since I was four years old we've always done things together, always been in touch. I said to her 'Look we're the same family--what kind of germs do you think you're going to get from me?'\"A bit of a defensive remark to be sure; but probably the way most of us would respond to an unappreciative, critical comment from a cared-about aging parent, grandparent, relative or older friend. And we most likely don't feel good about it afterward.But we can understand--and have sympathy for--the 92-year-old grandmother's response. Let's get picky and examine the circumstances since these kinds of situations happen often--only the specifics will differ.When we're accustomed to feeling we have control (and this is a feeling--and a reality--that keeps aging parents and others engaged in life), don't we fight to keep it? Being in a hospital, at least for me at a much younger age, greatly reduced feelings of having control. In fact depending on the circumstance we may feel helpless, definitely frustrated, and these feelings are probably intensified for an older person for reasons I think we can all understand.Thus, to gain some feeling of control (in this case over the way she wants her water), the grandmother sets standards and asserts herself, at the expense of her grandson. Although it came across that way, it wasn't really criticism of her grandson. It was the expression of a greater need she had for control.On a similar note I remember when my 93-year-old father gave up driving and was riding with me.  On routes that we had taken a million times together, he would tell me--timing it perfectly--\"turn right\" or \"turn left.\"  He no longer drove, was no longer in control, but the need to have some control getting us to our destination was still there.We are sensitive adult children or we wouldn't be doing what we're doing and caring the way we care. And our emotions will take bruising--if not battering--at times.  (Note: I remember a list of things counselors should NOT do that my professor stressed many years ago. It included taking things personally, whereupon he said basically \"If it's a family member forget it.  Your immediate reaction will be emotional.\") My former colleague's reaction--so normal.Understanding the motivation of aging  parents, grandparents and others when we feel criticized, lectured to,  unnecessarily \"helped\" and unappreciated is important--not only to help parents age well,  but to help ourselves.",

        "content": "...to Keep Older Parents Engaged and Help Them Age WellThis is a time when we celebrate miracles.  The emancipation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt, when the Red Sea parted.  The Resurrection of Christ  after the Crucifixion. Older generations fondly recall Seders, when family members gathered together and children looked for the hidden matzo; or Easter services, and the children's Easter egg hunt, and the family brunch or dinner.As with all major holidays there is joy for so many; but for those who are old and feel isolated and lonely there are no miracles.Since Easter is here, not surprisingly my senior advisers tell me that Easter can be very lonely for older people living alone, without children to visit or take them out.  On the other hand, suggestions for doing things that will bring pleasure are many.The more obvious: taking aging parents out for brunch after church or for dinner later. This suggestion is embellished with:... the suggestion of eating at a place with a  lovely view or beautiful gardens to make the outing more special....a restaurant where aging parents who don't get out much can take a short walk (use a wheel chair or walker if necessary) so they can enjoy looking in shop windows, see normal activity....anything that includes grandchildren.When the Easter meal is at a family member's home and older parents want to bring a special dish, by all means accept the offer.  It feels good to participate.Then there are older people who are alone and find it difficult to go out. A visit is welcome with or without a little gift. However, below are some gift suggestions:...bring a little lunch or snack (\"nothing big,\" I'm told) to share while you talk...be sensitive to sugar and/or salt restrictions...bring a living plant that isn't fussy. Check at a nursery or flower shop--suggestions: (philodendron [sweetheart plant], fern [nephrolepis], spathiphyllum [peace lilly--wallisi variety] or kalanchoe)....bring flowers. They brighten up a room....bring a blooming  plant for those who still like to gardenAlthough Passover is almost over, one 89-year-old adviser proudly tells me she made: chopped liver, matzo balls, gefilte fish, and horse radish for the Seder.  Not easy at 89, but she says she was able \"to work it out so I could make everything ahead.\" And best of all perhaps for her, \"It was a good feeling because everyone wanted to take some home and there wasn't enough left.\"This final story comes from the West Coast. There were no children to look for the traditional hidden matzo at the Passover Seder this year, so the oldest guests were sent on the hunt.  An 86-year-old male guest found the hidden matzo.  While not traditional, life today with children and grandchildren living near is not as prevalent as in times past. So it would seem that adaptation, flexibility, inclusion and thoughtful creativity go a long way towards helping parents and others age well, especially during the holidays.",

        "content": "Keeping up With the Time: Changing Clocks and Gadgets Palm Sunday.  I visited an independent, involved, highly respected widow in her early 80's, M.  She is a smart, welcoming, comfortable-to-be-with, common-sense person.   Conversations with her have substance.  You can count on her balanced way of looking at life for good, sound advice.Her married son lives half an hour away and has a demanding job, as does his wife.  They are supportive and don't interfere; although they are more than willing to offer help and do-- as appropriate.  Yet M tries not to impose.  She likes to handle things herself.  I have invited her to be one of my blog advisors.Sitting in her living room on a sofa facing a clock on a far-away wall, I realized that I had stayed longer than planned.   But our discussion was substantive and time just whizzed by.   When I mentioned the wall clock showed it was time for me to go, she informed me the clock didn't have the correct time.  Indeed the time hadn't been right \"for ages\" and she'd planned to get it fixed but didn't get around to it.I'd noticed the second hand going around and the time advancing, mentioned what I'd seen, and asked if she'd like me to take a close look at the clock.   I'm no clock repair-person, and she warned me the clock was high up and might be heavy.   So, not wanting to take over, I jokingly acknowledged my lack of repair expertise, but offered to take down the clock and have a look if she'd like.  She agreed and stood by my side to help.Turns out the clock was light, easy to handle, was plugged into a wall outlet; and it was easy to reset.   I think the time was incorrect due to daylight savings time and power outages over the years, because I checked today; it's keeping time.  M tells me not having an incorrect clock constantly reminding her it needed attention makes her feel better.   A little thing.  Then something else occurred to me.Aging parents or any old people on ladders is problematical.  So who changes clocks that may be above a kitchen sink or in other hard-to-get-to places?  And what about the--for me--tricky thermostat clock (which I left for my husband to change when we went on daylight savings time)?   Can older parents change the clock on the coffee maker, microwave, car, and latest gadgets--some of which may be gifts from us?   When we go on and off daylight savings time in the spring and fall, might it be helpful to older parents and friends if we offer to reset their clocks? Could it be another of those little things that mean a lot and help to make life easier?  Could it be one more ingredient to help parents age well?",

        "content": "You know those little things that are irritating because we should take care of them--or have them taken care of--but haven't?--like the button from a favorite coat or sweater that we meant to sew (or have someone sew) on;--the shoe that's been needing a repair that we couldn't wear the other day when we wanted to;--the knife we've been meaning to sharpen or get sharpened that made a mess of cutting that tomato;--or some battery-using device whose battery has died and not been replaced?We adult children know we are self-sufficient and can take care of these problems at will, albeit when time in our over-busy schedule permits. We know too how good we feel when these  annoyances have been taken care of.But what about aging parents?  If they don't drive, they are dependent on others to take things for repair or replacement.  If they're old, technological malfunctions that may be a second-nature fix for younger people and grandchildren are frustrating, causing insecurity and necessitating a dependency on others.Are we aware how often others--service people, for instance--disappoint, even if their intentions are good? And as our parents age, the people they have counted on  to provide services--be they doctors, painters, tailors, plumbers---you name it--retire, move away or die.In the olden days, families members more often than not lived in the same town and would gather once a week for a meal after church or regularly for dinner one night a week.  I am told this regularly planned family get-together offered a continuity of support to older family members, giving them an opportunity to mention things that needed attention in their homes, after which one family member would volunteer to take care of the situation.\"The stress (of things that are in disrepair or not taken care of) begins to build up,\" confides a widowed aging parent.  \"It's hard not knowing if or when, for example, my clogged drain will be fixed.\"One of my senior advisors says that kind of stress could simply be alleviated if an adult child or another caring younger person could be counted on to come over once a week on a regular basis--for an hour even--to help take care of the simple things (and bring a container of Draino).  \"Just knowing that you can depend on that once-a-week visit would alleviate the stress that begins to build up,\" she says.So take note: It sounds like just an hour a week of our time--to help take care of whatever our parents might need us to do--is another way of helping older parents (as well as other older people who are special to us) age well.",

        "content": "Airports--and Answering MachinesAn octogenarian tells me that I neglected to  mention answering machine messages in Tuesday's post that discusses imperfect hearing and the problems aging parents can have understanding unseen voices that convey important information. How thoughtless of me.   How astute of her!Haven't we all--young or old--received  messages on answering machines and voice mail where important  information (a call-back number, a meeting time, even the name of the  caller) is said so quickly or softly it's unintelligible, even when  replayed at a higher volume?Evidently one smart  80-something-year-old woman with hearing problems has put the following instructive message on her answering machine: \"please speak slowly and clearly and loud enough when  leaving your message.\"  Adult children can and should mention this  message idea to older parents, especially those hampered by hearing loss. It makes sense for so many reasons. And  asking if parents want to put the message on by themselves or have help  doing it shouldn't seem like an intrusion. It's so sensible and scores another  plus in our efforts to help  our parents age well.*       *      *Now airport  strategies: While I clearly oppose the concept of becoming parents to  our parents (unless our parents are mentally incapable), there are two  potentially helpful strategies for getting around in airport terminals that can alleviate worries for older people while contributing to their adult children's peace of mind.The first concerns a provision that allows parents to accompany  unaccompanied minors to the gate, which of course necessitates  identification etc. etc. and can vary from airline to airline. But it has a flip side that enables adult children to accompany their aging parents to the gate in the same way parents arrange to  accompany their young children to the gate.  Simply the thought of having a responsible family member there is supportive and can reduce worry for aging parents. It can make the getting-to-the-gate-and-on-the-plane aspect--which is stressful at best these days--relatively stress-free.Some  of my friends were critical of the fact that I \"let\" my father  travel  alone on airplanes when he was in his early 90's; my  mother-in-law  travels alone at age 96.  It seems logical that once up in the air flight  attendants are  better trained than we (unless we've had special  training) to handle problems that occur. Initially I got the special  pass to accompany my father and my mother-in-law to the gate, because  they both  liked to--and could--walk.  Assuming a responsible, punctual  person can be at the other end to meet aging--and elderly-- parents, is  there any reason why people in their 80's and 90's shouldn't fly alone?The  second strategy involves the wheel-chair. As terminals grow, walking  distances increase, and at a certain point, both my father and my  mother-in-law ended up ordering wheel chairs to get them efficiently to  the boarding area.  It's reassuring to know that attendants not only  push wheel chairs and see that passengers get on the correct plane  easily, but provide another set of eyes and ears and they're usually  pleasant companions. In addition, a wheel chair can make a  carry-on-bag--often  too heavy for older people--easy to bring along. (When my dad learned about the carry-on luggage option, he gave up walking and enjoyed wheel chair rides for the last 2 years of his life.)Travel  is invigorating; we all know that.  It adds knowledge, fosters relationships, can provide  some exercise and usually provides fun. All are a plus for aging well.",

        "content": "When Speaking Clearly Can Make a Big DifferenceHave you ever wondered how well someone with imperfect (or sometimes even perfect) hearing can understand what an unseen voice is saying?Think aging or elderly parents--or even yourself--calling an office where the person answering the phone rattles off the name of the business so quickly it's unclear whether the intended party has been reached. Usually there's a chance to confirm with a human being that you have reached the intended phone number.  But what if the voice delivers important messages over a loudspeaker?I was at the airport yesterday, waiting to board a flight.  The gate was in the back corner of the very crowded terminal. Thus two gates were at right angles as were their lines to board two flights--which happened to be leaving for different destinations at the same time.  Announcements for many departing flights were continually blaring over the loudspeaker--some in understandable English, some in heavily accented English, and some in very good English that was spoken so quickly you couldn't catch all of it.A lady and a man were trying to help an elderly woman who hadn't heard all of the first boarding announcement for her flight: the announcement welcoming people needing extra time etc. to board first. The helpful lady and man were standing in separate, big lines so close together I assumed they were husband and wife.  In actuality they were strangers, but they were the kind of people you hoped would be near your aging parent if he or she ever needed help.The elderly, nicely dressed woman was, I observed, legitimately flustered because she knew she missed part of the announcement. She questioned the helpful lady who confirmed that the elderly woman could be boarding at that moment. Yet there was a crush of people making it impossible for her to move to the front of the line.  That's where the helpful man got involved.  He overheard the conversation as did I, got out of his place in line and--as if on a football team but gentler--blocked for the elderly woman and eased her way to the ticket taker so she could comfortably board the plane before the crowd.The helpful man returned to his place in the line, spoke with the initially-helpful lady, I interjected my observation that they were both very thoughtful, and we talked about how difficult it was to hear the boarding announcements during a busy time in a crowded airport.  Are the people responsible for giving important information--be it on the telephone or in public places like airports--aware of the necessity of speaking clearly?As we try to support--not reduce--older parents' quality of life, it makes sense to think about common situations, such as hearing loss, that can impact outcomes and cause anxiety. While airports can be a challenge waiting to happen for older people, two solutions that don't rely on the kindness of others, will be the subject of Saturday's post. Helping an aging parent to feel comfortable flying alone affords opportunities to travel, visit family. It's empowering. It enriches life. And each time we can support our aging parents' quality of life, we are helping them to age well.",

I learned that a monthly pamphlet, about city affairs, accompanies the water bill and this month announced a small scale experiment aimed at improving the transportation situation. (I understand there was also a short article in the newspaper, but of course not all older people read the newspaper.) The notice is copied below:*              *             *City offers seniors reduced taxi faresConcerned about the heavy demand for the city's Dial-A-Ride service, Phoenix Public Transit has initiated a pilot program that allows seniors to ride taxis at reduced rates.Funded jointly by the city and the federal government, the Senior Cab voucher program is seen as alternative public transportation for persons 65 and older.About 400 seniors are being signed up to take part in the pilot program that is expected to last about 19 months, after which the city will decide if it should be made a permanent addition to its transportation offerings.Senior cab was developed at the request of the City Council, which asked the Transit Department to explore alternative modes of transporting seniors because Dial-A-Ride has increased demand for Americans with Disabilities Act-certified users, making it increasing unavailable to seniors.Participants each month can buy up to four $10-voucher books for $3 each, which is 30 percent of their value.  The vouchers can be used for an entire trip, combined with cash fares to travel further or banked over several months for a longer trip.  Riders are responsible for their own gratuity.For more information call (number given, I've omitted it).*            *             *While only an experiment, it's a creative idea that I'm thinking some readers might want to share with their town or city officials.

        "content": "When our goal is to help aging parents regain an interest in life, assuming they once had it (if they never did, a behavior change is unlikely), it makes sense to keep two issues in mind: our parents' flexibility as well as our own. These issues will impact the ease and satisfaction of reaching our goal--be it to have our parents leave their home or apartment to go anywhere but the doctor or to once again become engaged in life.Young people who are basically healthy (physically and emotionally) are usually fairly elastic--physically more flexible and emotionally more able to rebound unscathed from emotional upsets.  (Think teenagers, who are in despair  one day and on top of the world the next.)  But at a certain point in the aging process this elasticity or flexibility begins to decrease. If this weren't the case, why are there countless exercise programs and where did that old saying \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\" come from?The analogy, that speaks to the mental part of this equation, conveys the idea that old dogs are set in their ways--inflexible; not  a flattering analogy to an aging parent to be sure.  And yet most adult children  of aging, old and very old parents have probably experienced the inflexibility--sometimes puzzling-- that comes with age.Do older people seem inflexible because hanging onto certain ways of doing things that have worked for them in the past gives a sense of security that they don't want to put at risk? And how elastic are we, in understanding the insecurities and reasons that seem to frustrate our attempts when we try to help?We ponder these questions and how they impact vacationing with aging parents and providing other opportunities to help them regain or increase their interest in life; and we realize one size doesn't fit all.  But if we keep flexibility in mind, as well as the importance of empowering, and if we think about using the \"I need your help\" phrase when appropriate, we can hopefully find at least some of these strategies useful as we try to help our parents age well.",

        "content": "Four Words That Can  Change Resistance to Compliance\"I need your help.\"  These four words are  powerful.  They can do more to help aging parents do what's best and  what's right than any other phrase I know.  I learned the value of this  phrase from a counseling colleague and have used it successfully in my  counseling with temporarily irrational parents, difficult kids, and  seemingly inflexible teachers and administrators.And I've used  it with strangers--to untangle airline reservations, to speak with a  supervisor when all else was failing, and with family and friends-- when  appropriate. I use this phrase  only when I do need help. It has never  disappointed.\"Why?\" you ask. \"And where does helping aging  parents fit in?Let's elaborate.  When you say to someone \"I need your help,\" the  implied message is that the person you're speaking to is capable and that's flattering. People rarely turn  down that simple request. (Contrast that with \"can you help me?\"   Notice how it allows for refusal?)\"I need your help\" also psychologically pulls the  other person into your space giving him or her a vested interest in helping to resolve the  problem. You've appealed to his or her ego (self-esteem) by admitting you  need his or her help.  This makes aging parents feel good and clearly not  threatened, providing a nice way to begin a potentially difficult conversation. You and they become partners in solving the problem.I don't believe we are our parents' parents...not until our  parents ask us to take over or we know from a doctor that they are no  longer capable of decision-making.   So when adult children say \"I need  your help\"  to an aging parent, the mere statement is respectful and affirming.\"I need your help\" is as applicable to the big issues, like driving or changing living arrangements, as it is to the smaller ones; but if we overuse it, it loses its effect--as we undoubtedly know.   Parents don't like being talked down to, lectured  to, or being  told--point blank--what to do. \"I need your help\" is a good way to begin a thorny conversation.  And I stress \"begin.\"  When you begin any other way, it dilutes what you're trying to accomplish.So try the \"I need your help\" statement especially in a situation that you think parents may initially reject or resist, even though it's for their own good.  When adult children can help their aging parents to buy into a solution, it's better for everyone--and sometimes generates worthwhile ideas no one thought of before.  And when an adult child, who's trying to help aging parents, begins by admitting he or she needs their help, shouldn't the collaboration have a better chance for success?PS.  When life and limb are involved and parents are resistant, a parent's physician is often in the best position to makes suggestion, if \"I need you help\" should fail.",

        "content": "Aging and Appearance: A Personal Shopper for Aging Parents?  Who? You?Z at age three in North Carolina already has favorite clothes...and favorite colors: pink and red. Ideas about what we wear seem to begin early. Yet not everyone is clothes conscious with a priority of looking good. Our Prada parents are, but aging parents in the Dumpy group probably aren't.Some aging parents would dress to improve their appearance if:--they could easily get to a store (addressed in last post),--they thought they had the money to buy new clothes,--trying on clothes in fitting rooms didn't take so much effort,--they had confidence in their taste in clothing.So what's a child to do when he or she wants to ensure that aging parents look good, are less apt to be treated as \"old\" by strangers and have healthy self-esteem?  Take on the role of a personal shopper of course. Thankless? Perhaps. Professional personal shoppers get paid for their time on the job, have benefits if they're employed by a store, and develop a loyal following if they do a good job. Adult children will forgo all of these rewards. Never-the-less, having parents who feel good about themselves pays other dividends such as contributing to their adult children's peace of mind.Older people may think a dated, perhaps ill-fitting, comfortable wardrobe is adequate.  Those of us who hate to part with worn, comfortable shoes can understand this.  So a key thought is to get parents to buy into the idea of your shopping to add whatever they'd like to their wardrobe.  One 80-something-year-old widow said I would love it if my son said, \"Mother, I'd like to buy you a new blue sweater...unless you'd prefer another color.\" She liked the idea of a new sweater, she said, and blue was her favorite color.  But being given a choice appealed to her. That, of course, is a small start.  But don't many things begin with a small start?The more information we have about color, size, and style the more successful we can be. We also benefit from knowing about any physical conditions that affect aging parents' clothing choice. For example, I remember a designer two-piece outfit on sale that became a real bargain when the coupon I had further reduced the price. It was Mother's favorite color, her size. I bought it and had it sent to her, never realizing she had become self-conscious about her arms. To this day I don't know if it was because they had become thin, wrinkled, flabby or what.  And I was unaware she had stopped wearing clothes with short sleeves until she told me. Lesson learned.  Ask your parents not only about preferences but also about things to avoid. Then make certain to know about a store's policy on \"returns.\"Since we want to avoid taking over anything while our parents are mentally capable (unless we want to create dependency), collaborating (a popular  concept today) with parents makes sense.  Initially it takes more time. Eventually we see what works and what doesn't and develop the instincts of a professional personal shopper.Who knows?  We may decide to give up our day job! What we do know is that we can help aging parents to look good. And that never goes out of style.",

We find ourselves talking about our aging parents, like we used to talk about our children.  \u201cMy mother is 90, stylish, has a Prada handbag,\u201d says one adult daughter.\r\r    Think back. We recall that not all parents could honestly brag about their children, just as not all adult children can brag about their aging parents.  Some parents will age gracefully and well and their adult children will be proud; others won\u2019t and this often causes problems. Then there\u2019s always a large group in the middle.  That group is the focus of today's post and several to follow.\r\rIf our relatively independent  aging parents fall into that middle group when it comes to dress/style,  let\u2019s consider how we can ensure--without sounding critical--that  they always look well-put-together. By doing this we accomplish two goals:\r\r--One, people are more apt to react positively to aging parents  who looks \"in order\" than to a  frumpy, dumpy looking aging individual, because people react initially to what they see. This in turn can enhance parental self-esteem and even confidence as opposed to diminishing it.\r\r--Two, when we look better, we feel  better and when we feel better, we look better. I think this is true for most--if not all--of us.  So if we want to help parents age well, there's a lot to be gained if they look well-put together. \r\r     It's pretty easy for young people to look relatively good.  But as people age, looking good takes more energy, more time, and more attention to detail than we might realize.  The older they get, \"the harder it gets\" according to my eighty and ninety-year-old advisors. Clothing styles need to be age appropriate or they look silly, or they may be dated. (Sometimes it's hard to part with old clothes.)  And clothes must fit properly to avoid the saggy, baggy, poorly-proportioned look that we often see. Sweat pants, which usually look fine on younger people, may feel good but can be unflattering to aging figures.\rWhen we know it's in their best interest, yet we don't want to seem controlling or critical, how do we encourage aging parents to take pride in their appearance?\r--We can go shopping with them and make it a fun occasion.--We can become their personal shopper, with their permission, and bring them a selection of clothing to choose from (then return what's not wanted).\r--We can have a dress maker or tailor fit their current clothing to their changing/changed figure (taking in, letting out, shortening etc.).--We can gift them with clothing on special occasions: three that come quickly to mind are birthdays, Mother's and Father's Days, and Christmas or Chanukah.\rGive thought to these ideas.  Saturday's post will elaborate.\r\r\r\r   \r\r\r\r\r         ",

However, I  begin--thinking about what hearing from former students could mean to an  aging teacher.  Could that, at the very least, be a psychological jump  start?Today I learned that Mr. W, my high school chemistry teacher who was so important to me that he was the subject of my college application essays, has cancer.  An email arrived this afternoon from a high school classmate, one of my closest friends during those teenage years. Although separated by 3,000 miles, he updates me about important situations.The thought is that Mr. W would no doubt enjoy hearing from people in our class. Mr. W is probably in his 80's now, possibly an aging parent. I tried but couldn\u2019t remember whether or not he and his wife have children.The idea of giving back in some small way to people who mean or have meant a lot to us, clearly has merit.  If they mean/meant so much, we are probably special to them.  So although this post was initially intended for adult children of aging parents, I realize the idea of a jump-start is equally relevant for all adult children and applicable to all aging people important in our lives.When we stop and think about it, can\u2019t human beings of all ages use a jump start now and then?  No doubt there have been days when we\u2019ve all felt lackluster; when our spirits needed lifting; when we would rather stay in bed than get up and have to perform whatever\u2019s expected of us.  But we usually can\u2019t languish (unless we\u2019re seriously depressed), because of family demands, expectations of friends and colleagues, and because our circle of contacts and our ongoing involvements coax us mentally to get up and get going.Most aging parents in the chronologically younger group, no doubt have many people and activities in their lives; thus many possibilities to trigger the jump-start mechanism exist.  As people become chronologically older, however, the outside influences in their lives lessen, their support group dwindles and a needed jump-start may be harder to come by.A jump-start takes many forms; but in all cases it makes people feel better and can be empowering--the unexpected phone call, anticipation of something to look forward to (like a grandchild\u2019s visit), a spontaneous invitation, a surprise visit, invited participation in some endeavor.  Far-away living adult children often find the simple fact that they\u2019ve come to visit provides a jump-start for their aging parents. The possibilities are only limited by our imagination.",

        "content": "Are We Controlling?  Do We Have a Hidden Agenda?Our wig-shopping spree over, my husband\u2019s mother, R, said she could use a little \u201crest.\u201d I\u2019ve never researched aging parents\u2019 idea of a \u201crest.\u201d  Her idea at 96: sitting and talking with her son, my husband, for almost two hours.  (I took a nap.)  Then we all went to R\u2019s best friend N\u2019s home for a Swedish dinner.If we needed proof that aging parents can organize and cook to perfection for company, we had it! N, at 86, is an awesome (and I don\u2019t use that word lightly) cook. Even more awesome when you consider her age and the food she prepared. Our meal\u2014green salad with just-picked grape tomatoes, fresh salmon with dill, the best small potatoes imaginable, creamy spinach, home-baked limpa bread and a Tosca cake for dessert\u2014was equal to that of the finest New York restaurant.The fifth guest was N\u2019s child, a daughter in her fifties, who runs a demanding, time-consuming business, yet brought the tomatoes and dill from her garden. The relationship between N and her daughter is respectful, mutually supportive and obviously loving.  Many daughters\u2019 instinct would be to come in and take over when an 86-year-old mother undertakes a \u201ccompany dinner.\u201d We can only imagine how much energy goes into preparing such a dinner\u2014at any age\u2026but at 86?! This very able daughter did it right.  She quietly helped as needed; but it was clearly her mother\u2019s dinner party.I began to think about adult children who insist on taking over major responsibility for holiday family dinners once older mothers reach a certain age.  Reason: They\u2019ve decided (rightly or wrongly) it\u2019s too much work for an aging parent.  Some older parents give in.  Others question the motive, especially that of far-away-living daughters.  These mothers are skeptical. \u201cThey say it makes it easier for us, but I think it makes it easier for them. It saves them the trouble of bringing the kids (our grandchildren) to us,\u201d says one grandmother, who\u2019s not yet ready to give up the tradition.Think back to raising children. Remember how often the experts say that it\u2019s important to let a child perhaps struggle a bit but do for him or herself, as opposed to jumping in to help because we can do it better or easier.  This reinforces confidence and self- esteem.  The same reasoning holds true for aging parents, doesn\u2019t it?  Don\u2019t we want our aging parents to continue to feel competent and proud of the fact that we think they are, when indeed that is true?This brings us to one of our key thoughts:  Assuming there\u2019s no threat to life and limb, should we intervene and/or offer suggestions to make it better or easier for ourselves or focus on what makes it better for our parents?",

        "content": "What happens when you put a new wig on an aging parent\u2019s head?  Surprise! At least for me.Neither my husband\u2019s mother nor I (I think I can speak for her, she\u2019s often more attuned to these kind of things than I) realized that the majority of ready-made, out of the box, and thus less expensive, synthetic wigs are geared for the faces of relatively younger women.  It\u2019s not necessarily a problem of hair color; rather it\u2019s a problem of style.And when you think about it, it makes sense.  While companies are beginning to act on the realization that people are living well longer, it seems these wig manufacturers are still catering to women who are newly-minted senior citizens and younger.That said, it is possible to purchase synthetic wigs that compliment an older face. The skill of the people working in the wig boutique/shop is what makes the difference.  For that reason, going on line to purchase a wig (unless you know the style # and have worn that wig previously) is not recommended; neither is using the Yellow Pages to make the initial phone call unless it\u2019s to check whether or not the shop has someone who is experienced at thinning down and styling a ready-made wig.  Reason: these wigs are manufactured using a basic, simplistic, universal, oval face as the model and the commercially styled hair is thicker/fuller than the hair of most older people, whose hair often thins due to age. (This certainly would include many of our parents or we wouldn\u2019t be thinking about wigs.)Aging parents probably want a more conservative hairstyle.  If making the phone call, ask about more conservative hairstyles for older people.  Yes, I know, the styles are for \u201canyone\u201d but frame an old face with a cool new style and there\u2019s a major disconnect.  This doesn\u2019t mean a 70-something-year-old, with a young face, can\u2019t wear a new style.  The wig may need to be thinned a bit, but it works.  For a 70-something-year-old with a lined or older looking face, however, forget it and go for the more conservative style. I was curious about men who lose their hair and, as expected, learned women far outnumber men when it comes to purchasing a wig.  Then I was told about a man who came into a wig shop catering to men and women.  He was wearing a hat over his obviously balding head and wanted to purchase a \u201chairpiece.\u201d (I am told the word \u201ctoupee\u201d is pass\u00e9.)  It would have been trimmed and blended into his own hair.  However, he tried on a wig; it looked \u201cawesome.\u201d  It was trimmed to compliment his face and \u201coff he went into the sunset without his hat\u2014a happy camper.\u201d Michelle, at Wigs Amor and Forever Young in Arizona, says at both shops people come in thinking they know what they want but \u201cmore often than not, you like something you weren\u2019t expecting.\u201d  It may take a while to decide on the right wig for the right natural look.  And older people may not make decisions as quickly as younger ones, possibly because they take less risks and/or want more time to digest things. So plan on taking some time if you have aging parents who want or need a wig. One thing I can vouch for: it\u2019s not only helpful and supportive to shop for wigs with a mother or mother-in-law; it\u2019s fun. And a lot of laughs!",

Hair is one of the first things we notice when we look at someone. Hair, age-appropriately styled and in order (as opposed to messy and unkempt), is as important for the young as it is for aging parents who don\u2019t want to look like dumpy old men or little old women\u2014for aging parents who care about appearance.  And now that I think of it, it\u2019s also important for adult children to have a vested interest in their parents\u2019 appearance.  Why?  If we want to empower and lessen the possibility of strangers categorizing them as old and responding to them in ways that diminish self-esteem, aging parents need to look in order.

Many guests had known each other since high school. And when you think back to people you knew well in high school, you realize in most cases you also knew a lot about their families, even their pets.Last night brought a story from someone who was not part of the high school group. But many can relate to the story she shared.Her mother had come west to live with this adult daughter (the story teller) and her husband. The mother, relatively healthy but having minor memory problems, said she wanted to get a driver\u2019s license so she\u2019d have an official ID now that she was living in another state. Her adult daughter\u2019s husband was not in favor. Did not want to encourage his mother-in-law\u2019s driving at her advanced age.As often happens, the adult child felt caught in the middle. She didn\u2019t want to deprive her mother, on the one hand. And on the other, her husband had a point. But since her mother hadn\u2019t shown herself to be a dangerous driver, the daughter gave in and accompanied her mother to the Motor Vehicle Department.Her mother passed the vision test\u2014no problem. Then advanced from one station to the next\u2014passing without problems. Then she had her picture taken. The last part of the procedure was to sign the official form, which was handed to her to sign. For whatever reason, she was confused about where to sign or how to sign.The Motor Vehicle Department official seemed puzzled and looked at the adult daughter. Her eyes met his (and perhaps she discretely shook her head). Whatever. He got the message. He explained to the mother that he couldn\u2019t give her a driver\u2019s license, but he could give her an identification card with her picture on it. That wasn\u2019t a problem, she said. All she wanted in the first place was an ID with her picture on it.",

        "content": "Thanks to those of you who told me how gratifying it was to make contact with older friends during the last week. It's a win-win for everyone, isn't it?Thanks also to those who questioned the solution of the \"opinionated\" grandmother who kept family peace by basically saying everything the younger generation did was \"fine.\" The questioning is valid and the grandmother's solution is appropriate and understandable if we go back, reread and digest the November 7th, \"What's the Goal?\" post.In that post I related something helpful from my counseling experience: suggesting that parents ask themselves \"What's the Goal?\" when dealing with their children's difficult behavior. It's simple, easy-to-follow guidance that's equally applicable here. Keeping the goal first and foremost in mind, when facing potentially heated situations, is just plain smart. It prevents getting sidetracked, prevents exacerbating a situation, and avoids a lot of unpleasantness.If the goal of the self-described \"opinionated\" grandmother is to maintain good relations and peace in the family, she has made a decision that works well for her. And this highlights another, perhaps more difficult, aspect: the importance of knowing ourselves and the impact we have on others. Understanding this is not always easy and sometimes it takes counseling to gain this awareness. In any event, having this understanding serves us well as we deal with many challenging situations.I want to note here that there may be a time when we need to change goals mid-stream so to speak. And that would be a time when discussion discloses that there's a threat to life and limb. While that doesn't happen often, the possibility someone could hurt him or herself or others is serious and would probably necessitate a quick change in goals.Lastly remembering to keep \"What's the Goal?\" in mind is as important for the older generation interacting with the younger generation as it is for the younger generation interacting with their aging parents.",

        "content": "Many traditions disappeared with the last century yet New Year's Resolutions continue. One teenager thinks today's resolutions are more self-serving (exercising regularly, losing weight) than focusing on others. Perhaps. An octogenarian recalls her teenage resolutions like giving up candy didn't last very long. But she says that her resolution to be nicer to and spend more time with her widowed grandmother who lived with her family sticks in her mind as lasting.When talking about resolutions that involve family as opposed to self, my small sample of older people (from Arizona, Delaware, New York, and Oregon) care deeply about their children and grandchldren and are making--or have made--resolutions to further cement the relationship.For example, resolutions to \"let go\"--or at the least not pressure--when family situations and values upset an older generation prevail:               \"I will try to accept what my grandchildren and children do. (I must learn to     accept it 'cause there's nothing I can do about it.)\"               \"I'm going to try and figure out how to take a \"stand\" that would work and not destroy family relations.\"               \"I speak for myself and other friends--we've just been discussing values. I'm making a resolution not to get upset by the fact that adult children may be wonderful; but they don't value the same material things we do...old family heirloom things: furniture, a cup collection from my grandmother, my great-grandmother's Christmas tree ornament etc.\" Other resolutions involve family in a different way:               \"I'm going to tidy up this year. If I die I'd hate for my kids to come in and have to clean up all the stuff I've accumulated over the years.\"       \"I'm going to make it a point to listen more, to find out more about my far-away-living grandchildren and what they're doing. I visited at Christmas, listened to their music with them, discussed the lyrics, learned who Taylor Swift is and what's important in their lives. I even learned about hockey and watched a game. My grandchild is a star hockey player. Now we have a commonality to email about and discuss.\"          \"I am going to accept the fact that my far-away living son and family are very busy with their own lives. While they're at the top of my priority list, I know my husband and I are not at the top of theirs even though we all get along very well. So if we want to be with them more often than twice a year, we have to make the accommodations.\"               \"I want to maintain my health (I'm 92) so I can be around to see my great-grandchildren develop; and I want to keep working at my business.\"One admittedly \"very opinionated\" grandmother says \"This is a big stretch for me, it's so unlike me not to say anything, but I made a resolution years ago--I have many children and grandchildren--and it has worked to keep our family together. It goes like this:Whatever they do is fine.Whatever they say is fine.Whatever they want is fine.\"It seems adult children and grandchildren, whether living near or far, live large in their parents' and grandparents' minds, perhaps even beyond what we might expect. A 92-year-old puts keeping herself in good health because she wants to watch her great-grandchildren \"develop,\" ahead of continuing to run her business. That says a lot. Is a New Year's resolution by adult children and grandchildren to make an effort to regularly communicate with and include the older generation in order? Perhaps it already exists.",

And we are left with the emotional residue--wonderful or not so wonderful, depending.When it's something we've been dreading, it's no doubt an emotional relief to have it over. When it's something we've looked forward to, and it meets or exceeds our expectations, we may be filled with happiness and wish it could last. But since it can't, we may feel sad, or it's a \"let down.\"The day after Christmas signals such an ending is coming and it's not uncommon for people who enjoy the festivities to have an emotional response. When aging parents have a busy life the holidays don't necessarily fill a void, rather they are a welcome addition to an already busy schedule. When parents live alone, however, and don't have a busy life, the void left at the end of the holidays can intensify feelings of emptiness, and of being alone. And the fact that winter weather sets in and it gets dark earlier isn't helpful in certain parts of the US.Can adult children inflate that let down feeling? Yes. First, refer to this past Tuesday's post and reread the three suggestions. Next, use your 2010 calendar to ensure the three suggestions aren't forgotten.I am remembering the advice given to me by a priest interviewed for my divorce book years ago. He talked about the importance of touching base on a regular basis with people we care about when they face challenges or need us in their lives. To this end, he said, he wrote on his calendar at regular intervals--daily, twice weekly, weekly, monthly etc. etc.--\"phone so-and-so,\" putting their telephone numbers next to their names. He said it was the only way he could be certain of regularly continuing the connection. That advice turned out to be helpful for me at certain times with my counselees and their parents. It's rarely lack of interest that prevents us from doing something additional on a regular basis. More likely we just get busy and forget.So once again I guess we need to be thinking about picking up the phone--after we take out our 2010 calendar or whatever date-book technology we use and write in a few names and numbers of our older, living alone friends and possibly even our parents.",

And kids, amid shrieks of laughter and merriment, are sledding down our shared driveway on anything they can find that's large enough to sit on. Sun is shining, snow balls are flying, and I'm certain school vacation is adding to this happiest of times.Then my counseling background kicks in and I remember that holidays aren't always the happiest of times for people. So I decide to check in with a few older people and see how they're doing. (I'm a counselor, trained to ask objective questions.) My findings:The consensus, from my small sample--but there's no disagreement: This is the haa, haa-py-est time of the year for children who have none of the responsibilities of adulthood, for newly marrieds who are looking forward, and for young couples with children who still believe in Santa. It's an especially happy time when older family members are geographically near enough to children and grandchildren so that they can gather together to celebrate and talk about shared past experiences. Meanwhile the excitement of the children in the family provides a background of energy and optimism.\"The holidays are a time when our mind drifts back to past Christmases that were happy times. It's a sentimental time,\" recalls one older widow. \"It's a wonderful time when families can get together, yet a lot of people are completely alone. As people get older, they have experienced losses. Especially for those who've lost their mates, other people's happiness can be a reminder of the losses we've incurred. We're just more vulnerable to that kind of thing when we get older.\" \"Unless there's a lot of family around and a lot going on, it's not the happiest time of the year. It's depressing,\" shares a 70-year-old man.There's agreement that it takes effort for older people to find this a happy time. \"It doesn't just happen,\" says one. \"It's what you make of it when you're older,\" says another. \"If you make the effort to be with people it's good, but it can be exhausting. We may continue to decorate and continue to write notes on the Christmas cards because we want our home to look festive and we like to get letters back after we write the notes. But we need to trim down and trim back so we aren't too tired to enjoy.\"So then I ask the question: How can younger people help? Can they help?The answers:1. Keep in close contact with elders--aunts, uncles. Make sure they're not forgotten.2. A phone call even; it doesn't have to be a visit. I had a wonderful phone call from a far-away relative recently. You know older people don't relate to an email as they do to a phone call.3. It's nice to take older people out to something, but take them to something that is rather quiet, that isn't too taxing an experience.* * * * *OK, everyone. Why not pick up the phone and talk with at least one older person who lives alone or feels isolated. Brighten his or her day. Make these older people feel special, cared about...because they are. Raise their self-esteem. Add interest to their lives. Major studies confirm that connections are one of the most important factors in successful aging. It may not be the Haa, Haa-py-est time of the year for most older people, but we can make it better.",

        "content": "This situation may not be all that uncommon, although I hope I'm wrong. It involves a retired, respected professional in the health care field and his independence; and his capable, caring adult daughter with an extraordinarily busy life. And stuff that can happen, but shouldn't.Rodney, divorced, and in his early 80's, was living happily by himself in a condo in a very nice southern California suburb. Because of his profession he had many friends who valued his wisdom and kind ways. But he was increasingly seeming \"spacey,\"-- \"dementia-like\" to those who knew him well. He appeared unsteady on his feet at times. Close friends obviously noticed this and may have attributed it to his age. (We've discussed how people hesitate to \"rock the boat\" in a previous post.) So the reasons for no one questioning this physical and mental change could be many.One day Rodney took a bad fall in his apartment. A neighbor heard his call for help and phoned 911. At the local hospital where supposedly they did a full evaluation to determine the cause of his fall, his daughter was told he needed assisted living. She quickly and efficiently made arrangements for assisted living, but it was soon evident that Rodney needed even more help so a private aide was hired to be with him. More falls, more trips in and out of the hospital. No one understood the cause, only the effect as Rodney became more and more frustrated and, at times, unruly.Assisted living could not provide the care Rodney required. So his daughter located a group home with adequate staff to watch him and prevent more falls. The superviser of the home, a thorough person, had a hunch... that medication could be causing Rodney's problems. It then surfaced that Rodney (who could legally write prescriptions), had prescribed a medication commonly used to aid sleep for himself. Rodney had no primary care doctor (unrelated specialists treated him). And evidently prior to the \"hunch\" no one was aware Rodney was taking this medication and that it could produce the side effects Rodney was experiencing.The good news: the group home's superviser put Rodney on a new medication. He's himself again; he's much steadier on his feet. The bad news: he has nothing in common with the residents at this group home. He doesn't like living there. But during these many months his efficient daughter quickly sold his condo because, she was told, he could no longer live alone and because funds were--and would be--needed for his care. Rodney has no condo to return to.Initially his daughter was glad to see him cared for, didn't wanted another upheaval, and thought she would have peace of mind. But with new medication, Rodney made it clear he had no reason to stay in the group home.A bad start, lack of information, incomplete knowledge, inaccurate assumptions, and a busy, caring daughter's well-meaning quick fixes. Upon rereading this story, it makes sense that people, who have--or have given--power of attorney and/or health care proxy responsibility, reread and share the \"Key Thoughts\" (see sidebar at right). In addition: 1. It would make sense for adult children to have a current list of parents' medications.2. Getting help from an experienced geriatric social worker would most likely have reduced stress on the busy daughter and led to well-thought-out changes with a quicker, better outcome.* * * * * Oh yes, Rodney did move from the group home, but much time had passed and other problems arose, so he moved to an assisted living facility.",

But I want to take a minute to talk about the fact that so many adult children feel there is too much to do and too little time to do it in. A friend has aptly named this phenomena \"compressed time.\" I don't think I speak only for myself and my friend when I say many of us are slaves to this phenomena.This may be one of the reasons younger people can seem rude to older people, whose metabolisms probably run at a slower pace. In this coming Saturday's blog I am going to discuss a sad, but true story, reported by someone I've known for decades. It may have been driven by caring adult children's feeling of \"compressed time.\" You can judge for yourself. In any event, it's an instructive story that will be a gift to two generations if it saves any other caring adult children and their adult parents from such a situation.I could not find a place for the story in my book. But it needs to be publicized. The consequences of not knowing this story are too great, in my opinion.

Every nook and cranny greeted me with colorful holiday decorations, creating such a spirited atmosphere that I almost forgot where I was. The theme was Christmas (with a smidge of Chanukah). Clearly much time, thought, and energy went into decorating this nursing home. I thought about how uplifting it was to be surrounded by a holiday atmosphere and how much I loved it as a child.It reinforced the reason, throughout my growing up years and even now, with no children present in the house, we decorate for holidays. Why? Tradition no doubt, but I think it goes deeper. Going through the ritual lets us indulge ourselves as we think about times past; and with the tradition and creativity that go into transforming our homes for the holidays comes a special feeling of warmth and joy.Eloise and Earl, who died in their 90\u2019s, had to be the masters of this art. (You haven\u2019t met them yet but they figure prominently in my book.) Their tree decorations were unique, and chronicled their life and their friends. No surprise that their tree was featured in House Beautiful and provided a photo op and text for a NY Times article some years later. Its ornaments-- a nut cup from their wedding, an eyelash curler from some still-secret event in their lives--along with hundreds of items from friends and from their travels to almost every place in the world, conjured up countless memories. These older people had inordinate energy; and while I think many older people would love to have this kind of energy and decorate every year, most don\u2019t.Yet well into their 80's, Eloise and Earl made a decision. Climbing to the highest step on the ladder and stretching out over the staircase railing to put the honored piece on the top of the tree needed to be done by someone younger. The tree, over a story tall (and positioned in an area where the staircase curved up to the second floor) required stretching and reaching from the balcony to the branches for the finishing touches. My husband inherited this job, wobbling on the ladder, finally putting the ornament perfectly in place when Eloise would teasingly say \"Could you move it about half an inch to the right (or left).\"Back to the present I wondered: would offering to help with holiday decorations bring additional joy to aging parents as it did to Eloise and Earl? Does it make sense to renew everyone's curiosity in that old box of ornaments (it's probably stored somewhere) so we can share a special experience with parents or other older people in our lives? If the old box no longer exists, do we start our own tradition and purchase some decorative items? Older and younger people engaged in a project together is empowering and generates a sharing of ideas and memories we might otherwise never know about.My parents are no longer alive. But I'm thinking of someone to whom I may offer my help. I love to decorate. So my offer may turn out to be a more meaningful gift for my older friend than any I've listed in the previous two posts...except for the wide rubber band jar opener, that is!",

And Ruth\u2019s place card leaf took its new place as part of the centerpiece. (Nov. 21 post.)R at 96 and her best friend (86) were the oldest.  Three of the younger guests were new to our Thanksgiving tradition.  They included a new boyfriend, one of Ruth\u2019s granddaughters, and the youngest son of R\u2019s neighbors.  His mother was at R\u2019s birthday luncheon saying after her mother died, she turned to R for understanding and wisdom. (Oct. 13 post.)This Thanksgiving over 25% of our guests were newcomers, and while there were many connections, some had never met our family nucleus before.  Sixteen people, their ages ranging from 22-96, represented 8 decades.  And R, who seems to remember almost everything, says it\u2019s the best Thanksgiving she can remember.  Her back-up comment: \u201cNo one in the family even thought of turning on the TV.\u201dIt was like an intergenerational magnet .The wisdom of the older, the accomplishments and activities of the younger, and the energy, optimism, and moving forward spirit of the youngest pulled everyone together.*                                  *                                  *                                   *                               *Tuesday\u2019s post will feature holiday gift possibilities, given the season has begun.

        "content": "Thursday is Thanksgiving. My favorite holiday. For me it's a warm, inclusive, happy yet somewhat poignant celebration of our good fortune in this country and we remember also that many are not as fortunate as we. My husband has begun the meal, since we've had men and women fighting overseas, with a short prayer for their safe return, expressing our gratitude for their sacrifices.While I have always prepared the majority of the meal, I have made a special point of encouraging older people to participate in the preparations. My father, alternated with Harry (when both were in their 80's and early 90's), stringing a cranberry necklace for the turkey--something I'd seen on the now deceased Gourmet Magazine cover many years ago. If I couldn't cook the elaborate turkey, I could at least make--or have Dad or Harry make--it look elaborate.Mother, in her 80's, made her special pumpkin chiffon pie, but bought, instead of making, the dough as her fingers became more arthritic. And R., who celebrated her 96th birthday in September (see October post), fixed the stuffing and helped me make Harry's wife Mary's yams, after Mary died in her early 90's.And so traditions begin and are continued. For almost 20 years, since I saw part of an early morning Martha Stewart prepare-for-Thanksgiving show before going to work, I have made place cards on autumn leaves, guests' names written with a special white ink pen. During these years guests have brought boyfriends, girlfriends, and fiances; and have divorced, broken engagements and died. We have disposed of all but the latter's place card leaves, which are placed name side down, along with other autumn leaves, around the centerpiece.Ruth's leaf will be a new addition to the name side down group this year. I think she was 93 when she died. It wasn't easy for her daughter--and later grand-daughters--to pick her up from her assisted living apartment almost an hour away. But she looked forward to coming for Thanksgiving. And as long as she wanted to come, her grandchildren made the effort to bring her and take her home. And as she grew more frail each year and had sight only in one eye, she continued to create for me a Thanksgiving card of appreciation.When something means a lot to an older person, but entails going out of our way and even sustaining an underlying worry that some emergency type health issue could interrupt everything, our knee-jerk reaction may be that we don't want to make the effort (which is probably very little effort compared to the effort an old person must make). But when we do, and see the priceless joy we've made possible, how could we not make that extra effort.",

Before, during, and after her husband\u2019s death, her days were filled with activities; but from almost the moment he died she told everyone she \u201cdreaded\u201d eating alone and being alone at night.Preparing and eating healthy meals can be a big hurdle for people living alone. While older couples can enjoy each other\u2019s company at meal time, the thought of eating alone is painful for some older widowed people, and dreaded by others. Still others cook and eat alone, although transportation to grocery stores can be a problem.In such instances, adult children can schedule a time (or two) each week to take parents grocery shopping (or hire someone to do this). Also thoughtful still-driving neighbors can offer rides. Some older people make plans to share a taxi when they go shopping.One widowed mother, on a fixed income (as are many), goes to the market with someone twice a week. Never-the-less her daughter buys extra groceries on sale (3 for $2.00) to share with her mother who likes to cook.It enables her mother to have items she might not want to afford otherwise, while making reimbursement by a proud parent, who doesn\u2019t want to accept \"charity,\" insignificant or unnecessary.Dignity upheld.This same daughter not only brings groceries during her weekly visits, but cooks with her mother, when time allows. She and her mother enjoy doing something real together, making/baking then freezing some in small portions to ensure delicious food at another time. A famous writer said she wanted to participate in life-- didn't want to be a \"passenger in life.\" Doesn't cooking make one a participant?Question: How can adult children enhance parent's nutrition? Suggestions:Give a \"Fruit of the Month\" gift for special occasions (wwwHarry and David).Bring cheese and crackers and/or fruit, instead of candy and cookies, when visiting any older person.Bring sugar-free drinks and treats for those on sugar-restricted diets.Bring flavored bottled water which can incent even non-water drinkers to drink (especially important for older people who don't experience thirst as much and can easily become dehydrated).Nutritious snacks like peanut butter filled pretzels with or without salt are available at Trader Joe's, as are \"blister peanuts.\"Meals on Wheels supplies a complete, nutritious hot meal daily.

        "content": "The NY Yankees won the 2009 World Series last week. What a way to inaugurate the New Yankee Stadium! Jubilation reigned in the ballpark. But George Steinbrenner, the Yankees owner, did not attend the game. Millions watched as his son, Yankees' managing partner Hal Steinbrenner, accepted the magnificent World Series Trophy, crafted by Tiffany & Company.Mr. Steinbrenner, now 79, was home watching the game on TV, we are told. For over three decades he invested so much of himself--financially and emotionally--in his Yankee team. Since money is no problem and he must have had all the resources to make it easy for him to attend the game--limo, luxurious box, capable caregivers--we can only guess as to why he stayed home. But that's not the our primary concern. What was this victorious moment like for his sons, Hal and Hank? I thought about the importance we place on having our parents with us to celebrate important events.These thoughts followed: Why is it so important? Are our wishes for our parents always compatible with their wishes and needs? Do we want things for our parents that we assume will be good for them, not realizing it may have the opposite effect? I was discussing these questions with a friend, who shared the following true story with me. It was one of those eye-opening moments:The wife of a prominent community leader who was in the middle stages of Alzheimer's, wanted him to accompany her to an important social event. She thought that it would be good for him to get out, he would have many friends at the event, and she wanted him to participate in life. You can imagine her surprise when she found him sitting in the bedroom crying. \"Why?\" you ask. Because he was having a lucid enough moment to realize that he wouldn't recognize people he should recognize and he didn't want to embarrass himself and end up feeling foolish.My friend said she could relate to this situation because of her mother, who has macular degeneration. A still bright and intelligent woman in her early 90's, she stopped going out socially because of the difficulty she had recognizing people she knew. And it was hard to see food on a plate or in a bowl so she no longer wanted to eat out. While she had pride, she greatly appreciated it when friends came up and said something like \"Hello A. It's me--Sally,\" saving her from embarrassing moments. But that didn't happen often enough even though her friends knew about her vision problem.Which brings us back to the reality that there are important occasions our parents just can't be there to share with us, even though they'd like to and we'd like them to. And while we may feel bad, it doesn't change anything, so probably everyone feels better if we find ways to make the best of it. I think the Steinbrenners--young and old-- set a good example. ",

I\u2019ve found it\u2019s equally helpful with parents. (Indeed, to be honest, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s helpful in dealing with almost any situation.)\u201cEmpowering Parents\u201d and \u2018Keeping Them Safe\u201d (preventing threat to life and limb) are goals and as such are repetitive themes in this blog. As I was reading Tuesday\u2019s post, it was perfectly clear that parents have pride, fear losing independence, and resent being lectured to. It was also clear that adult children may live with a constantly unsettled feeling that can rise to \u201ccrazed\u201d unless we have the tools to give us confidence.So this brings us to our goals for ourselves. And this is where the advice given on the airplane (\u201cFirst place the [oxygen] mask over your nose and mouth and then assist others) comes in. Many have said we become \u201cparents to our parents.\u201d That clearly isn\u2019t empowering. Indeed it puts additional responsibilities on us and creates additional stress for us, assuming parents are still competent. If they\u2019re not, of course, we must step in and that is the time we, legitimately in my opinion, may become parents our parents.Until then, towards our goal of empowering, we have opportunities to uphold and support parents\u2019 pride\u2026in their ability to handle things, in their wisdom, in their appearance, in their accomplishments. We can no doubt add to the list. When parents get old and especially when they live alone, pride may be one of the few things they have left. Indeed the compliments that are so much a part of normal every day life may be hard to come by. Supporting parental pride when legitimate, (they\u2019ll know if we\u2019re faking!), contributes to self-esteem and makes people feel good. Obviously when parents feel good about themselves, we, as caring children, feel good and isn\u2019t that a good goal for ourselves! ",

        "content": "It's hard to know when our parents' emergency events will occur.  One thing I do know--on a few hours notice I was able to fly from Milan, Italy to the West Coast in the same day.I knew my mother was having medical issues as I left for a vacation in Italy. Indeed I had reservations about going so far away.  On the other hand, when we have older parents we never know when an event will happen and rationally I knew it didn't make sense to put life on hold awaiting such an event. So we followed through with our plans to go to Italy with friends.Some years earlier I had attended a program about aging parents.  It included a clip from a film or TV show featuring an adult child whose life literally revolved around her parents and her concerns about their health issues.  She was so consumed with apprehension every time the phone rang, that it seemed plausible that she would make herself sick and that her husband would book a one-way flight to a far-away place!  While the film clip seemed exaggerated and somewhat ridiculous, I didn't forget it. For this trip I planned ahead, leaving my itinerary and contact information along with instructions about doctors and doctors' appointments for everyone who might need them.Night #1--Milan:  the phone call came. Everyone but Mother had gone out for a birthday dinner.  Mother had recently come out of the hospital and remained home with a caregiver; but she needed oxygen.  Her doctor wouldn't order oxygen and simply put, the caregiver (who couldn't reach the family) worried Mother would die, and decided to phone me in Italy. Needless to say, I made immediate plans to return to the US.Fortunately I had a Plan A--someone to meet me at the airport should I ever need to make the quick trip back.  And that part of the plan went like clockwork. I should say, as a far-away-living daughter, many years before I had spoken with my brother about his flexibility should I need to fly back on the spur of the moment.  I also discussed this possibility with a very good friend so I'd have a back-up if my brother wasn't available.When I got to the house my limp, semi-asleep mother could barely keep her eyes open, and was in no condition to appreciate the new sweater I managed to buy in Italy or anything for that matter.  But I knew she was glad I was there. With a list of Mother's doctors and an updated list of her medications always in my wallet, I was ready to communicate intelligently with her doctors.  Turned out medication-- too much and some unnecessary--caused the problem.  So simple, yet so emotionally and physically draining for everyone involved.What did I learn?  Planning ahead for emergency situations makes so much sense.  When stress is high it's comforting to know we don't have to worry about certain things and we do have some control over others. When coming a distance, having someone who cares and shares our concerns meet us at an airport is welcoming and supportive.  And keeping essential information in a wallet makes communication with professionals more effective. I also learned we have good friends who we had to suddenly abandon in Italy  They survived and so has our friendship.      ",

I haven\u2019t met the bride or her family so I have no idea of the generations that will be represented on her side. One thing I do know, weddings are almost always intergenerational events, giving old and young the opportunity to interact easily, sharing a common, celebratory feeling during that brief period of time.I\u2019m reminded once again of Katy\u2019s mother, who we met in the last post. But this time she had a diminishing experience, that even Katy couldn\u2019t have predicted, when she attended a bridal shower for her granddaughter several years ago. Katy\u2019s mother was 86 at the time, without wheel chair and a bit younger than she was in the last post. After the shower as they were driving home she reported to Katy (who sat no where near her mother at the shower) that a \u201cyoung girl\u201d (actually an adult in her early twenties) came over, introduced herself, sat down, and they had \u201ca really nice conversation\u201d until the end when the \u201cgirl\u201d was getting ready to leave and said: \u201cI really enjoyed talking with you, Gran.\u201dKaty\u2019s mother was incensed at being called \u201cGran\u201d (a name even her grandchildren didn\u2019t use). No amount of explaining or rationalizing that this was probably the endearing term the \u201cgirl\u201d used with her own grandmother, could erase the negative effect of a young woman\u2019s well-intentioned conversation with the bride-to-be\u2019s grandmother, who considered herself a capable, normal woman--not an old lady.It\u2019s hard to get into the head of older people, but older people have shared with me so that a wider audience can understand certain ways of thinking. For most, the importance of being respected and not considered \"old\" top of the list (along with independence, decent health and good friends).",

        "content": "A good friend's mother died last year at 104. A proud, strong woman with pride and standards, she became less easy to get along with and more set in her ways as she aged. She was fiercely loyal and I loved her. However, there was a fine line that no one should cross if they wanted a relationship with-- and/or cooperation from--her. That was the line that diminished dignity. She remained independent in her own apartment with part-time help, until she was 102 and her unsteadiness led to falls. So it was a choice: caregivers in her apartment or a care facility of some kind. While she chose caregivers, she balked at having them. They, of course, didn't dare call her honey or sweetie or dear, but then they couldn't call her \"chief or boss\" either (POST 1). So they addressed her by her formal name: they called her Mrs. Miller. That suited her just fine.Her trips to emergency increased with her age and age-related issues. Her son was at-the-ready, leaving instructions at nursing stations and the like saying \"She wants to be called Mrs. Miller,\" after he informed appropriate people individually. If there was to be cooperation, Mrs Miller needed to be treated with--and know she had--respect.I think about the many alert, mentally capable elderly people whose lives are untentionally diminished by people who assume if you're old, you can't be treated like a normal functioning human being. It's not ill-spirited. Is it thoughtless or a response to a stereotyped idea of older people? We could say it's not politically correct. But most likely many would not listen because old people won't have a loud enough political lobbying voice to be heard on this subject until baby boomers age a bit more. Yet calling older people well-meaning, but diminishing, names is just one example. I think about Katy's mother who, in her late-80's, needed a wheel chair when there was a lot of walking involved. She was a smart and with-it woman, but Katy noticed that if they were going shopping, for example, the sales associate or clerk would address remarks to Katy, even though Katy's mother had initiated the conversation. This can happen in doctors' offices, at hospital registration sites, you name it. On the other hand, if we go shopping with our smart, with-it teenager (who's in a wheel chair for some not-observable reason) and he/she initiates a question, our teenager is answered. Check it out!If we are sensitive and find ourselves involved in an experience like Katy's with her mother, Katy's response, \"You know, Mother asked the question,\" is a good model. In a nice, but straight-forward way, it redirects the conversation to her mother so that the sales person or whoever is aware of his/her unfounded assumption. (And even if he/she doesn't \"get it\" completely, our parent isn't excluded from the conversation.) We are so often on fast-forward that these diminishing experiences are easily ignored. But older parents, who usually have less going on in their lives and therefore may attach greater significance to things we hardly notice, say:\"It chips away a little at a time.\" If your parent is not as strong as Mrs. Miller and empowering is a goal, these kinds of slights may be well worth recognizing.* * *If you have older parents and wish to share other examples for a future post, e-mail me (address at right sidebar).",

An e-mail from a reliable friend (after reading the driving posts), informed me of that fact because that man, who had a very distinguished career by the way, was her friend\u2019s father.And we worry about our aging parents driving cars.We learn about increasing numbers of amazing old people all the time it seems. Is it because of medical advances and health information causing people to live better longer and/or because of technological advances and instant communication? In any event I'm going to tell you about a woman people call \"remarkable\" who never drove a car, much less rode a motorcycle. Today, October 13, she is 96 years and one month old.Facts: R. was widowed at 51. Her only child, my husband, lives far away. She flies unaccompanied to see us. She doesn\u2019t use a cane. Everyone comments that she still has style, always looks well put together. The 40 birthday cards and phone calls she received a month ago are testimony to the love and admiration she has earned over the years. She is the wise octogenarian in my yet-to-be-published book.R says she had to be independent from an early age. Independence is now a highest priority; she doesn't want to be taken care of. So she exercises (still uses the tread mill she bought right after her husband died) and \"I don't abuse myself.\u201d Translated: she eats right, rations her energy for what\u2019s important and she makes the effort to be with people she cares about. She uses taxis and handles all of her affairs, and reads widely so she knows what\u2019s going on.Living in the same home since the 1940\u2019s, R has welcomed many young families and babies to the neighborhood--always with a small gift for the babies. The babies have graduated high school and college and new families have filled homes that the others have left. She\u2019s a surrogate grandmother, mother and wise friend to young and old. Who else would have a turkey sent to a neighbor\u2019s son at college to share with friends who couldn\u2019t be home for Thanksgiving?R didn't want a celebration for her 95th birthday. This year was different. A neighbor in her 40\u2019s was giving R a birthday luncheon. The 11 guests\u2019 ages were 13-96. The hostess\u2019s 13-year-old daughter wanted to be there as did her 25-year-old sister (recuperating from an ankle fracture).No gifts; only memories shared around a large dining room table. One guest expressed how fortunate she felt to live across the street, saying after her mother died, she turned to R for understanding and wisdom. Another shared a time her husband and son were having difficulties and R suggested writing a note of explanation, instead of arguing while emotions heated up. It works! The 13-year-old said R was responsible for her New York trip with her class last spring, when her parents were uncertain about financing it. R explained to her mother why it would be a worthwhile experience (and gave the child a bit of spending money for the trip). R was as dear to these younger and older women as they were to her.R has lived a long time, making the effort (it gets harder every year, she says) to remain involved, always thoughtful with words and deeds. Is that what enables her to so successfully span generations? Is it her genuine interest in others or the fact that you hear wisdom and feel a solid connection to what matters when she talks with you? Is it because she\u2019s an inspiration and remarkable? Well, everyone and every birthday card says she is. * * *Do you have or know a remarkable, older parent? E-mail and tell me why. I'll try to use it in a post (with or without her/his first name).",

I got to thinking about end-of-life issues\u2014about my Dad and I discussing what I needed to know because I was his healthcare proxy (also called healthcare representative).  I thought about problems that developed among siblings I know after parents died and the will was read.  I wondered if there is a way to reduce that potential for conflict among family members, assuming the family members get along well to begin with.I spoke with an attorney, a friend who has practiced trust and estate law for many decades and has excellent instincts about family relations.  He says it\u2019s better if adult children know certain things ahead of time: for example, who will be trustee or have power of attorney. That prevents second-guessing the rationale after the will is read. He advises parents to bring adult children into the process (assuming they are responsible in the ordinary sense) so they are not \"left in the dark.\"  At the minimum, he suggests that adult children know:1. who the key advisors are (accountant, banker, casualty and life insurance agent, doctor, lawyer, and stock broker)2. where the important documents are located.If this isn't possible or desirable, adult children should at least know whom to contact.  And lastly, ideally adult children should also know if there is a living will and in general what the will provides.He continued with this idea which I really like: Parents who don\u2019t want to discuss anything with their children ahead of time can write a letter, separate from any formal estate documents, explaining his or her thinking when the will or estate planning was done.  It should be kept with other important documents with instructions \u201cNot to be Opened Until My Death.\u201d To go a step further, I know of instances among my friends, where the mother dies and the father remarries. I imagine you do too.  Then the father dies, leaving his adult children's relationship with the second wife in shambles.  The reason: wills that seem (and perhaps are) unfair to the father's biological children.  Could a letter, assuming a direct conversation before his death was too uncomfortable, be helpful?We talked about second marriages.  \"Situation that include children from other spouses literally cry out for careful thought and planning, to be carried out by expertly-prepared life and estate-planning documents,\" he counseled.If our parents haven't discussed anything with us yet, do we have the kind of relationship where we can initiate something?  Can we use this post as a springboard for discussion?Perhaps the above thoughts and information can help avoid some of the pitfalls.If you have ideas, thoughts, insights, or questions, e-mail me at the gmail address (right sidebar) and I\u2019ll get back to you before the next post.

While it focuses on children, the next-to-the-last paragraph mentions an Alzheimer\u2019s patient\u2019s recognition of her beloved dog.If we\u2019ve had a pet, we know the inexplicable bond.

A 2002 study found that older people who had pets experienced better overall physical and mental health than those who didn\u2019t.Halise Diamond, DVM at the Animal Referral and Emergency Center in Mesa, Arizona, reminds us that pets add so much to people\u2019s lives, but they\u2019re also a responsibility. She emphasizes that their care should be in keeping with an older person\u2019s strength and mental ability. For example, a forgetful pet owner who doesn\u2019t feed or overfeeds a pet, neglects its medications or overmedicates, can cause a pet serious problems, even death. If older parents have a pet and are becoming forgetful, Dr. Diamond recommends a calendar on which a pet\u2019s needed medications are written and then crossed off once given.If we contemplate giving a pet--to anyone actually--we need to consider:Does the person want a pet? (Dr. Diamond emphasizes this is true no matter the age of the intended recipient.)If an older person is on a fixed income, consider the cost of medical care\u2014even routine check ups can be expensive.If mobility is a problem, a dog that needs a lot of exercise is a problem.Puppies require a lot of training and older people aren\u2019t as forgiving as younger people when their possessions are chewed and scratched.Rescue cats and dogs are older and more mellow.The staff at a good shelter knows why pets have been relinquished and should be able to select pets that are appropriate for older people.Some birds live a long time and may outlive an elderly owner. Hmmmm. Do I want a bird?",

        "content": "I\u2019ve forgotten whether Dad\u2019s driver\u2019s license came up for renewal the year before or the year after his 90th birthday. What I do remember is the fact that it was renewed for 8 or 10 years!Also surprising: Dad went to the DMV bureau in a smaller town (he lived in a city) 20 minutes away. It was easy to park there; they were nice. He had a habit of keeping his driver\u2019s license and all credit cards, but one, hidden in the trunk of his car. As he began the renewal process he realized he didn\u2019t have his soon-to-expire license and told the DMV person that it was in the trunk of his car; he\u2019d get it. No problem--the computer could access data. He only needed proof of who he was. The only \u201cdocument\u201d that had his name: a Safeway Grocery Store club membership card in his pocket. Proof of ID accepted. Renewal granted.Fact: Some older drivers (and others) drive under \u201cify\u201d circumstances.Fact: When it\u2019s threatening to life and limb, prevention is key.Fact: Parents resent being forced to do something, just as we would resent our children forcing us to do something.Fact: The entities and agencies, you would expect help from, may be of little or no help.We all agree that we must stop parents who drive dangerously, but how do we do it without straining family relationships? If you're an only child, it's your burden. If there are siblings and the majority or all agree, great! If you don't agree, see information in #4.#1. What seems like a major problem, may be easily solved (could be medications or a case like Kim\u2019s mother). Remind mentally able parents of this. By pulling then into the situation and saying the problem may be easily solved, it's respectful, empowering, and helps them buy into whatever may come. To rule out serious problems, with your parents agreeing and perhaps making the call, first consult the primary care doctor, which may lead to additional testing (eg. vision, neurological).#2. If it\u2019s not correctable, the doctor is in the best position to deliver the message. This is a huge loss, a chunk of life is being removed. Doctors have practice in delivering bad news and hopefully do it in a kind, objective manner.#3. Many adult children have phoned police, insurance companies, DMV etc., in efforts to curtail parents\u2019 driving, and the results vary. It\u2019s sneaky, which is disrespectful and undermines self-esteem among other things. Understandably children usually don\u2019t feel good about it. Only as a last resort, it may have merit.#4. If we must deliver the no-more-driving message, how can we give facts, affirm our parents\u2019 ability to participate in the decision-making and arrive at a no-more-driving result? If we're uncomfortable with that responsibility, a social worker experienced with the elderly can be a big help. Contact a local family counseling agency or an agency whose social workers specialize in geriatrics. It definitely won't be the first time they've helped adult children with this problem.",

        "content": "Most of us think driving is necessary for our quality of life. No wonder we dread having the not-driving talk with our parents! If we can have this talk before driving is an issue we\u2019re a step ahead. If we\u2019re in crisis mode, it\u2019s so much harder.What follows are strategies and some information that I knew, wish I\u2019d known or tried successfully with my parents.I put older drivers in three groups: Those in the first group know themselves, are honest with themselves and quit driving when they should. They have pride and don't appreciate being told what to do. Denial characterizes the second group\u2019s members, who don\u2019t realize they\u2019re bad drivers. Drivers in the third group are the most difficult. They\u2019re not only bad drivers, but you can\u2019t discuss anything with them. Today we focus on groups 1 and 2.If your parent is in the first group like my father was, you\u2019re lucky. Dad took the \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d movie to heart; we had the driving discussion early. As a far-away-living adult child who believes in empowering, I found excuses to visit him every 4-6 weeks after Mother died. Once Dad turned 90 friends constantly pressured me to make him quit driving. (Age, you know.) I couldn\u2019t see making my father do anything if there was no threat to life and limb. I did check his car for scratches, dents, or newly painted areas during each visit.(I would have done that regularly, even if I lived in the same town.) If we were going some place together, I always asked him whether he wanted to drive. He volunteered at least once each visit.He stuck to the speed limit. Not over, not under. His depth perception was better than mine. He no longer had the radio on. \u201cA distraction,\u201d he said. Writing about it now I wonder if he surmised he was taking a driver\u2019s exam with me. He was in control.The second group is in denial. Denial exists without our even realizing it. It\u2019s a psychological mechanism that keeps us from facing a reality we\u2019re not yet ready to deal with. How do we speed up parents\u2019 readiness to face reality? We can only try. An often successful start begins by saying \u201cI need your help,\u201d which pulls them in as a partner to the solution. We could explain that older drivers should know about resources that extend people\u2019s ability to drive and offer information from the last post\u2019s websites, or possibly an objective observation we\u2019ve made of their driving or something connected to their driving; then see if anything resonates.For example, my mother had a stroke. She recovered well, but her balance was shaky. She worried about falling. She still planned to drive. My kneejerk reaction was to tell her all of my reservations. Instead I said objectively that she could drive (true), and she could have lessons to boost her confidence or go with me to a large empty parking lot if she wanted to try that first. I also explained that she would have to be able to get in and out of the car by herself and maneuver her walker alone (reality). At first she said she wanted to try, but then decided there was too much effort involved. Perhaps because Dad was still alive to drive her, she never drove again.\u201cDriving (or Not)\u201d concludes--honest!-- with the next post.",

        "content": "\u201cPerhaps the scariest road hazard is the one they don\u2019t make a sign for.\u201d The large bold type on the back cover of the August 10&17, 2009 New Yorker catches my eye: The silhouette of a girl, leaning forward, hands on the steering wheel, pony tail flying fills a drawing--a yellow and black, road-hazard-shaped sign, with a smaller sign just below saying TEENS. I save the back cover. I know I want to use it in my blog.When we think about scary drivers, don\u2019t we usually think \u201cold drivers?\u201d Mary\u2019s Florida father (last post) won\u2019t be driving for a while. That may be a relief. Admittedly many of us shudder when we think about older Florida/Arizona/California drivers. And some of us may wonder if drivers in their 80\u2019s should be on the road, period. If teenagers are \u201cperhaps the scariest road hazard,\u201d what about older drivers?Research shows that drivers age 55 and older are 25% of the driving population but have only 1% of the accidents. AARP tells us that older drivers usually drive fewer miles each year than younger drivers, so we must consider that. Also the number of accidents per mile rises sharply at age 75, which may be why some think older drivers are scary.The New Yorker back cover informs us that \u201cteens make up only 7% of America\u2019s drivers but account for 12% of all accidents,\u201d elaborating \u201cIN 2007 TEENS KILLED MORE THAN 3,000 PEOPLE IN OTHER VEHICLES.\u201d With the goal of supporting our parents\u2019 self-esteem and not taking away independence prematurely, how do children use the preceding facts and information when assessing and discussing older parents\u2019 driving?If we have aging parents and teenagers and we see signs of dangerous driving, how do we respond to each age group? Yes, I know, have sufficient insurance. But of course more is involved. Aren\u2019t we more likely to ground a teenager (whose whole life is ahead) but take the keys away permanently and change the life of an older person? Should one size fit all older drivers?\u201cMake Haste Slowly\u201d is good advice, unless there\u2019s a threat to life and limb. Taking time to get the information needed for informed decisions instead of knee-jerk reactions, is especially important when potentially life-changing consequences are at stake. As we gather information and review options, solutions for seemingly large problems are often clarified.Example: Kim\u2019s 76-year-old mother spends winters in the South with her adult son. Her mind is good and she\u2019s a good driver; but she gave her children a scare. She took a wrong turn going home from a party, got in a lane that put her onto a freeway, and ended up in a neighboring state. Ultimately she got home three hours later. While her son immediately wanted to take away the keys, her far-away-living daughter suggested their mother have thorough physical, neurological, and vision examinations-- taking away the keys only until the results were back. The results? She was fine. Then what? Creative thinking. Her adult children gifted her with a GPS programmed only for \u201chome.\u201d Three years later, a happy, confident, independent 79-year-old continues to drive without incident.",

        "content": "One night in August I came home to find a voice mail message from a woman who said an aunt had told her to contact me. She needed advice about home health aides. Her father was coming home from the hospital. When I phoned the Florida number I learned that Mary lives and works in New Jersey. Her healthy, Florida-living father (age 83) had his annual physical, was sent to a cardiologist, and thought it was no big deal. Although he told Mary, an only child, not to bother coming to Florida, she took a week off work and went. Father ended up with successful bypass surgery, but an infection followed, and he was now in an intermediate care/rehab facility about to be released.She needed reliable temporary help for her dad when he went home.I suggested the hospital social worker whom, it turns out, she had met with. She said she had \u201caround a hundred\u201d names of agencies etc. and didn\u2019t know where to begin. While medicine\u2019s not my competency, when there\u2019s a chance to empower a parent I grab it. After being told her father was very independent and mentally capable, I asked if her father preferred a male or female aide (hadn\u2019t entered Mary\u2019s mind, she said). I explained some men prefer men for obvious reasons or because they don\u2019t appreciate the nurturing nature (\u201cHoney,\u201d \u201cSweetie\u201d-- they want \u201cBoss\u201d). Having this kind of conversation with him is affirming and empowering. He would begin to feel some control, providing the potential for a better result.I also asked if there were family or close friends living near her dad. None. He and his girlfriend ended their relationship some months before and since she was in her early 90\u2019s, Mary didn\u2019t think she could be much help anyway.We discussed the importance of contacting an agency where the workers were bonded to ensure\u2014as much as possible\u2014that nothing would be stolen (a major problem and concern). Her response that her father had nothing of value in his condo made me think how violated and insecure we would feel if someone we depended on came into our home and took anything without asking and I mentioned this. I then added older people, like my dad, often balked at paying additional monies to an agency. Mary quipped \u201cAre your dad and my dad brothers?\u201d She had a plan.\"Empower\" is usually not one of the first words we think of when it comes to older people. More often we hear that we should \"preserve\" older people's independence, \"preserve\" their dignity. There is nothing wrong with that. Yet it's a static concept. \"Preserve\"--hold onto. Think about children. We try to empower, move them forward-- not \"preserve.\" Can we apply this to older people?Mary's father had no major issues until now. While we never know when our parents\u2019 first \u201caging event\u201d will occur, we do know that when we can find ways to empower, regardless of the situation, parents feel respect, feel some control, and everyone benefits.",
