        "content": "Recently a blog reader asked to enlist my help. He said his colleagues have been arguing in favor of building perfectly secure systems. He replied that you still need the capability to detect and respond to intrusions. The reader wanted to know my thoughts.I believe thatbuilding perfectly secure systems is impossible. No one has ever been able to do it, and no one ever will.Preventing intrusions is a laudable goal, but I think security is only as sound as one's ability to validate that the system is trustworthy. Trusted != trustworthy.Even if you only wanted to make sure your \"secure\" system remains trustworthy, you need to monitor it.Since history has shown everything can be compromised, your monitoring will likely reveal an intrusion.Therefore, you will need a detection and a response capability.If you reject the notion that your \"secure\" system will be compromised, and thereby reject the need for incident response, you still need a detection capability to validate trustworthiness.What do you think?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Recently I had a discussion with one of the CISOs in my company.  He asked a simple question: \"Can you tell me when something bad happens to any of my 100 servers?\"That's a very reasonable question.  Don't get hung up on the wording.  If it makes you feel better, replace \"something bad happens to\" with \"an intruder compromises,\" or any other wording that conveys the question in a way you like.It's a simple question, but the answer is surprisingly difficult.  Let's consider the factors that affect answering this question.  We need to identify the servers.We will almost certainly need IP addresses. How many IP addresses does each server have?What connectivity does each IP address provide?Are they IPv4, IPv6, both?Are they static or dynamic?  (Servers should be static, but that is unfortunately not universal.)We will probably need hostnames.How many hostnames does each server have?What DNS entries exist?Extrapolate from the IP questions above to derive related hostname questions.We will need to identify server users and owners to separate authorized activity from unauthorized activity, if possible.What is the function and posture of each server?Is the server Internet-exposed?  Internally exposed?  A combination?  Something different?How is the server used?  What sort of services does it provide, at what load?What is considered normal server activity?  Suspicious?  Malicious?What data can we collect and analyze to detect intrusion?Can we see network traffic?Do we have instrumentation in place to collect data for the servers in question?Can we see network traffic involving each server interface?Is some or all of the traffic encrypted?Does the server use obscure protocols?What volume of data do we need to analyze?What retention period do we have for this data?What laws, regulations, or other restrictions affect collecting and analyzing this data?Can we collect host and application logs?Do we have instrumentation in place to collect data for the servers in question?Are the logs standard?  Nonstandard?  Obscure?  Binary?Are the logs complete?  Useful?What volume of data do we need to analyze?What retention period do we have for this data?What laws, regulations, or other restrictions affect collecting and analyzing this data?Is the collection and analysis process sufficient to determine when an intrusion occurs?Is the data sufficiently helpful?Are our analysts sufficiently trained?Do our tools expose the data for analysis in an efficient and effective manner?Do analysts have a point of contact for each server knowledgeable in the server's operations, such that the analyst can determine if activity is normal, suspicious, or malicious?I'll stop there.  I'm not totally satisfied with what I wrote, but you should have a sense of the difficulty associated with answering this CISO's question.  Furthermore, at what number is this process likely to yield results in your organization, and at what number will it fail?  Can it be done for 1 server?  10?  100?  1,000?  10,000?  100,000?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Imagine you're a martial arts student.  One day you have a guest instructor, accompanied by some of his black belts.  They're experts in so-called \"pressure point fighting.\"  You've heard a little of this system, whereby practitioners can knock out adversaries with a series of precise strikes that lack the power of a brute-force approach.  Until today you've had no direct experience.  You may be skeptical, or maybe you believe such techniques are possible.  The seminar starts.  You watch the guest instructor explain his techniques.  He starts knocking out his black belts.  Maybe you believe what you see, or maybe you don't.  Then the instructor asks for volunteers, and several of your fellow students agree.  The instructor knocks them all out, including a student you really trust to not \"take a fall\" to make the guest \"look good.\"  You ask the student \"what happened?\" and he replies \"that dude knocked me out!\" Next the black belts fan out through the class to help teach pressure point techniques.  They ask you if you want to get knocked out with a three-strike technique, or if you just want to feel disoriented with a two-strike technique.  You decide you're a believer at this point, but you want to see what it feels like to receive a two-strike technique.  Sure enough, two rapid strikes later, you're wondering what happened but are still conscious.  That's all you need to believe; you're glad you're not lying on the floor, out cold!The class ends.  Several bystanders were watching through the studio's windows.  Some of them are laughing.  They think the whole class was fake, a joke, or stupid.  Some witnesses are curious.  They believe what they saw and want to know more.  A few ask questions.  Others mumble to themselves incoherently, probably intoxicated or mentally ill.One of the students decides to talk to a famous yet local news reporter about his experience.  This widely-read newspaper reports the story the next day, attracting a lot of attention.With a wider audience, an extended discussion takes place about this pressure-point fighting activity.  One company conducts a Webcast and a spokesperson says \"my mom used to knock me out with a frying pan when I was a kid!\"  He also says there's no difference between pressure-point fighting and getting punched in the face.Another company decides to register a domain name called \"pressurepointfighting.biz\" and starts talking about how it works, applying what they know from Western boxing.  This misses the mark but uninformed observers can't really tell the difference.A third company jumps on the pressure point fighting bandwagon, issuing supposedly original research, inventing its own analysis, and integrating the technique into its marketing material.  It turns out someone at the company had a confidential agreement with the original pressure point fighting instructor, but unilaterally decided to take a few pages out of his notebook and run to the market to make a fast buck.A fourth company knows a lot about pressure point fighting.  It writes original reporting based on its experience.  Critics claim this company is just offering marketing based on the new craze.Reaction to the news among those without direct experience is mixed, as might be expected.  Some readers are martial artists themselves.  They fear being irrelevant.  They are afraid their skills are not sufficient.  They decide to ridicule anyone who participated in the seminar, or who has knowledge.  Some readers distrust authority.  They think these techniques are just a government conspiracy to justify additional police powers.  The only reason anyone is talking about such affairs is their need to get greater budgets for their oppressive police powers, man!Some readers think the whole affair is \"fear, uncertainty, and doubt\" (FUD).  Who could knock out a person by hitting a few pressure points?  It's all a lie, or just the latest craze.  It must be fake.Some readers have been learning and practicing pressure point fighting for the last several years.  They know it isn't a joke, and it is real.  Also, some readers without experience realize they should learn more about pressure point fighting.  That knowledge could save their lives, or the lives of those close to them.  These like-minded people communicate privately, since the public arenas are now clogged with too many false discussions.Aside from the fact that advanced persistent threat is an adversary, and not a fighting technique, this story explains the last 6 weeks of APT activity in the security industry.  Not all factors are included, but enough to make my point.Incidentally, the pressure point class is true, at least as far as the class content is described.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "A blog reader emailed the following question.We recently had a CISO change, and in the process of doing an initial ops review and looking at organizational structure, one of the questions the new CISO has is about the viability of offshoring incident response... I would be very interested in your views on this matter, and would appreciate any feedback you can offer.As background, I've been involved in incident response in many different capacities: top-level military CERT, managed security services provider, fly-away consultant, government contractor, independent consultant, and top-level corporate CIRT.  In other words, I've worked in insourced and outsourced environments.  I strongly advocate insourced or internal, professional incident response teams.  Many technical people fixate on the technical aspects of security, as you might expect.  While technical expertise is critical, it is also critical to understand the client.  Depending on the size and complexity of the client, it can take an external team weeks or months to acquire the necessary understanding of the client to make a real difference.  Sure, an external team can probably perform great analysis if given the right details and context.  However, doing something about usually relies heavily on identifying and overcoming the various bureaucratic, cultural, financial, legal, and political challenges found in any suitable large organization.  Therefore, I believe internal CIRTs are necessary for all organizations larger than a few hundred employees.I believe it is appropriate and sometimes necessary to rely on outsourced incident response services when your organization meets one or more of these criteria during an incident.Your CIRT is nonexistent.Your CIRT is not staffed with enough people to meet the challenge at hand.Your CIRT is not technically equipped to meet the challenge at hand.Your CIRT needs help with a specific aspect of the challenge at hand.Your CIRT needs external assistance due to regulatory, compliance, or other legal issues.Furthermore, when I read the term \"offshoring\" I get the sense that the question may involve hiring contractors who work for the organization permanently but report to their home contracting organization.  In my experience any \"cost savings\" in such an arrangement are a figment of the accounting imagination.  I recommend full-time employees be CIRT members.Any thoughts from blog readers?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

For my part, I'm really interested in the following: characterizing network traffic.  In other words, develop tools and techniques to describe what is happening on the network.  (I'm sure a few commercial vendors think they are doing this already, but nothing approaches the level that we really need.)  Without understanding what is happening, we can't decide if the activity is normal, suspicious, or malicious.  Current approaches are far too primitive and limited.

        "content": "I'm wondering if this story resonates with anyone.Imagine a group of undersea divers.  They are swimming in the ocean doing some sort of productive activity, maybe retrieving treasure, or doing research, or something else.  The divers receive instructions from managers in a boat.Suddenly one of the divers is attacked by a shark.  It tears right through his diving suit.  There's blood in the water.  The managers see the blood but tell the divers to keep doing their work.  The injured diver attracts other sharks.  Now the other divers are being attacked.  The managers tell the divers to keep working.It's a disaster.  Divers are severely injured, and some are dying.  In the boat some generalist first responders see the blood, and recommend putting the divers in protective cages. They aren't sure exactly what is happening so they fall back on the standard operating procedures. A few of the divers seek shelter in the cages.  Now the managers are howling that the divers aren't doing their work.  They want the divers sent back out.  The generalist first responders don't know what to do.  They ask if anyone else in the boat can help.  Some specialist responders lower a camera into the water and see sharks eating divers.  They tell the managers to pull the divers out.  The managers concede that the sharks are a problem but they want some sort of customized response for each injury.  Can't we assess each diver, identify the damage, apply some bandages, and keep the work going?  This debate rages for hours, far too long in the opinion of everyone involved.  More and more divers are hurt, the sharks continue to swarm, and no one is happy.Let's explain this story.The divers are computers.The sharks are intruders, possibly even malware.Dying divers are computers whose data is being denied, degraded, or stolen by intruders.The managers are managers, or asset owners.The generalist first responders operate anti-malware software.The diving suit is anti-malware software in a default configuration.The cage is anti-malware software operated in a more aggressive configuration.Getting divers out of the water means isolating a compromised computer from the network.The specialist first responders are the incident response team.The camera lowered into the water is an investigation of the malware by the IR team.My question is: how should this scenario have played out?  I have a few recommendations:If you're going to swim in shark-infested waters, be resistant to shark attack, not ignorant of shark attack.  Realize sharks are everywhere and prepare your defenses appropriately.If you're attacked by sharks, and your defenses fail, your first priority is to try to save the first victim.The second priority is to protect the rest of the divers so they can continue their mission.The priority should not be to keep everyone performing their mission, because it ignores the risk of the first diver dying (data loss, etc.) and the risk of exposing the other divers to attack (propagation of the malware).The fastest way to accomplish both priorities is to have a pre-approved incident response plan, with provisions for getting divers out of the water.  This can involve an approval process where managers are told the situation and asked for approval to disconnect the victim.  The difference between this process and what happened in the story is that the debate centers on whether or not to implement containment, not what should be done in general.Managers have to realize that they can't put vulnerable divers in the water and expect no negative consequences when they are attacked.  Either spend resources up front to better protect the assets, or act quickly and decisively once trouble happens.  Trying to plough on whatever the situation descends into lengthy and costly chaos.I'm curious if anyone else has thoughts on this.  I am interested in cases where the threat is fairly common (i.e., not advanced threats), so there is little to be gained by trying to learn more by observing the adversary.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Every so often I receive questions from blog readers.  The latest centered on the following question:What level and extent should a security team and investigators be allowed to operate without having to ask for permission?This is an excellent question, and as with most issues of authority it depends on the organization, its history, culture, purpose, and people.  From the perspective of the security team, I tend to want as much access as is required to determine the security state of an asset.  That translates into being able to access or discover evidence as quickly and independently as possible, preferably in a way that involves no human intervention aside from the query by the security team.  When the security analyst can retrieve the information needed to make a decision without asking for human permission or assistance, I call that self-reliant security operations.  Anything short of that situation is suboptimal but not uncommon.Simultaneously, I want the least amount of access needed to do the work.  If the security team can get what it needs with a read-only mechanism, so much the better.  I actively avoid powerful or administrative accounts.  Possessing such accounts is usually an invitation to being blamed for a problem.Assume then that there is a situation where the security team believes it needs a certain elevated level of access in order to do its mission.  In my experience, it is rare to obtain that permission by making some sort of intellectual or process-oriented argument.  Rather, the security team should make a plan and justify the need for such access, but wait for an intrusion to occur that demonstrates why elevated access would improve the incident detection and response process. In many cases, management with authority to grant or expedite granting access lacks the focus or mental environment ready to think about making changes until an incident rocks their world.  Once management is ready to devote attention to a problem, they are often eager to hear of changes that would improve the situation.  At that point one should make a case for the new capability.  We see this pattern repeatedly in high-profile security cases; airline travel is the most obvious.Aside from waiting for a catastrophe, the next-best option is to collect some sort of metric that shows how the current suboptimal state of affairs should be unacceptable to management.  If you could show a substantial decrease in response time, an increase in capability, a decrease in cost, etc., you might be able to convince management to make a change without resorting to an incident scenario.  This second option is less likely to work than the disaster method, but at the very least it does lay useful groundwork prior to an incident.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Recently a group of managers at work asked me to explain why I blog.  This is a very good question, because the answer might not be intuitively obvious.  Perhaps by sharing my rationale here, I might encourage others to blog as well.Blogging organizes thoughts. Recently I nodded in agreement when I heard a prolific author explain why he writes.  He said the primary purpose for writing his latest book was to organize his thoughts on a certain topic.  Writing an entire book is too much for most of us, but consolidating your ideas into a coherent statement is usually sufficient.Blogging captures and shares thoughts. Once your thoughts are recorded in electronic form, you can refer to them and point others to them.  If I am asked for an opinion, I can often point to a previous blog post.  If the question is interesting enough, I might write a new post.  That satisfies this reason and the previous one.Blogging facilitates public self-expression. This is a positive aspect of the modern Web, if approached responsibly.  Many social networking sites contain information people would not want to preserve for all time, but a carefully nutured blog can establish a positive presence on the Web.  If you blog on certain topics that interest me, I am going to recognize you if you contact me.Blogging establishes communities. The vast majority of the blogs I read are professionally-oriented (i.e., digital security).  I follow blogs of people handling the same sorts of problems I do.  I often meet other bloggers at conferences and can easily speak with them, because I've followed their thoughts for months or years.  Book authors share a similar trait, although books are a much less fluid medium.Blogging can contribute original knowledge faster than any other medium. Blogging is just about the easiest way to contribute knowledge to the global community that I can imagine.  It costs nothing, requires only literacy, is easily searchable, and can encourage feedback when comments are supported.  Why do you blog?

        "content": "A blog reader sent me the following question, and prequalified me to post it anonymously.For reasons of security and compliance, more and more network connections are becoming encrypted. SSL and SSH traffic are on the rise inside our network. As we pat ourselves on the back for this, the elephant in the room stares at me...how are we going to monitor this traffic? It made me wonder if the future of security monitoring will shift to the host. It appears that the host, provided some centrally managed IDS is installed, would inspect the unencrypted traffic and report back to a HSM (host security monitoring) console. Of course, that requires software (ie an agent) on all of our hosts and jeopardizes the trust we have in our NSMs, because \"the network doesn't lie\".This is an excellent, common, and difficult question.  I believe the answer lies in defining trust boundaries.  I've been thinking about this in relation to virtualization.  As many of you have probably considered, really nothing about virtualization is new.  Once upon a time computers could only run one program at a time for one user.  Then programmers added the ability to run multiple programs at one time, fooling each application into thinking that it had individual use of the computer.  Soon we had the ability to log multiple users into one computer, fooling each user into thinking he or she had individual use.  Now with virtualization, we're convincing applications or even entire operating systems that they have the attention of the computer.What does this have to do with NSM?  This is where trust boundaries are important.  On a single user, multi-application computer, should each app trust the other?  On a multi-user, multi-app computer, should each user trust each other?  On a multi-OS computer, should each OS trust each other? If you answer no to these questions, you assume the need for protection mechanisms.  Since prevention eventually fails, you now need mechanisms to monitor for exploitation.  The decision where to apply trust boundaries dictates where you place those mechanisms.  Do you monitor system calls?  Inter-process communication?  Traffic between virtual machines on the same physical box?  What about traffic in a cluster of systems, or distributed computing in general?Coming back to the encryption question, you can consider those channels to be like those at any of the earlier levels.  If you draw your trust boundary tight enough, you do need a way to monitor encrypted traffic between internal hosts.  Your trust boundary has been drawn at the individual host level, perhaps.If you loosen your trust boundary, maybe you monitor at the perimeter.  If you permit encrypted traffic out of the perimeter, you need to man-in-the-middle the traffic with a SSL accelerator.  If you trust the endpoints outside the perimeter, you don't need to.  People who don't monitor anything implicitly trust everyone, and as a result get and stay owned.I do think it is important to instrument whatever you can, and that includes the host.  However, I don't think the host should be the final word on assessing its own integrity.  An outside check is required, and the network can be a place to do that.By the way, this is the best method to get an answer from me if you send a question by email.  I do not answer questions of a \"consulting\" nature privately -- I either post the answer here or not at all.  Thanks for the good question JS.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "I assume readers of this blog are familiar with the \"CIA\" triad of information security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  Having spent time with many companies in consulting and corporate roles, it occurred to me recently that two or even all three of these functions are no longer, or may never have been, the responsibility of the \"security\" team.  The diagram at left depicts this situation, so let's examine each item in turn.Availability is probably the defining aspect of IT.  If the resource isn't available, no one cares about much else.  Availability problems are almost exclusively the responsibility of IT, with \"uptime\" being their primary metric.One would expect confidentiality to be fairly central to any \"security\" team's role.  Exfiltration of data is partly a confidentiality problem.  However, the biggest headache in the confidentiality world has been disclosure of customer personally identifiable information (PII) via loss or theft of physical assets (laptops, backup tapes) or electronic exposure.  Companies now employ dedicated Privacy teams, usually staffed predominantly by lawyers, to specifically address the handling of customer PII.  One might have thought the \"Security\" team should have had responsibility for this subject.  Instead, a legal problem (\"Do we have to disclose the breach to customers and/or the public?\") is being addressed by lawyers.Integrity is the last of the three, and originally I thought it would be the core \"security\" task for the \"Security\" team.  Then I remembered Sarbanes-Oxley and Section 404.  I wondered if the Audit Staff's requirement to assess the \"integrity\" of records meant they had a more institutionalized role in this area than the \"Security\" team.So what does this mean for \"Security\" teams?  Looking at the problem in one way, you might think there is no need for a Security team.  CIA is covered by three groups, so Security is redundant.  This is a mistake for the following reasons.The IT staff is not equipped to resist attacks, especially advanced ones.  IT usually does a good job keeping resources functioning when equipment failure, provisioning woes, or misconfiguration causes downtime.  IT is usually ill-equipped to stop intelligent adversaries who are three steps ahead of overworking administrators.If an IT staff can't handle attackers, there's no way lawyers can.  Lawyers tasked with security responsibilities usually outsource everything to high-priced consultants.  Legal teams have the budgets for this, but it's not a sustainable situation.  Privacy teams focus on salvaging the company brand and market value after a breach; they are not positioned to resist or detect incidents.Auditors look for problems and effect change, but they do not implement change.  They look for weaknesses in processes and configurations, not intruders who have exploited those vulnerabilities.I believe this state of affairs leaves the Security team as the one group that has the proper mindset, subject matter expertise, and ability to implement defensive operations to preserve CIA.  This mission is not one the Security team accomplishes by itself, if that ever were possible.  Rather, Security will (if not already) need to pair itself with IT, Audit, and Privacy in order to be effective.  One could say the same for and Compliance groups, Governance officers, and/or Physical Security teams, although I'm less worried about those ties right now.It should be clear at this point that it doesn't make sense for the Security team to work for IT, given the role it must play.  A Security team working for IT is likely to be stuck supporting the Availability aspect of \"security\" at the expense of the other CIA elements.  Furthermore, it could be difficult for Security to build the necessary bonds with Audit and Privacy if those groups see the Security team as \"just part of IT,\" or \"technologists.\"  In this light, it makes sense for Security (CISO) to be next to IT (CTO) in the corporate hierarchy, both working for the CIO.  Ultimately the CIO is responsible for the company's information, so I don't see a way for [information] Security to be beyond the CIO's reach.How does this review compare to your own experience?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

We are fortunate that we have a reasonably interesting and attractive work environment, readily available financial resources, and a relatively manageable event load. We've been trying to hire a mid to senior level analyst position for at least a year now, and have been having absolutely no luck whatsoever. The job responsibilities mainly consist of  analyzing events from the SEM and NSM stacks, documenting and resolving incidents, and conducting regular vulnerability management operations. A majority of the applications we get seem to come from security \"architects\" who may have some product deployment experience, but little to no applicative analysis skills necessary to un-haystack the needles, or pursue an incident to closure. Very few of the interviewees can even get past the technical phone screen, which consists of the following three questions:You see an IDS/IPS event in your event console called \"some kind of IDS event name here\".What would you do to investigate the event, and how would you validate that the event was a real attack and not a false positive?How would you determine if this was a one-off event, or part of an overall pattern?What other kinds of information would you seek out to build a more complete picture of the context around this event?After having investigated the event, you have gathered enough positive indicators that the actual traffic consisted of a legitimate attack against a server you suspect may be vulnerable to an an attack of that kind.How do you determine what may have happened to the server? (This question is usually geared towards whatever platform the candidate might have actual technical experience with.)What would you do if you saw a subsequent event that indicated the target system had downloaded a file from the internet soon after the original IDS event?How could you recover the file? What would you do to analyze it? (This question usually evolves into some platform-specific live forensics, network forensics, and incident response.)You conduct a vulnerability scan that produces output that indicates that a server X (operating system Y) may be vulnerable to issue Z.What would you do to validate the finding?How would you validate the finding if the report indicated the issue was present on 100 machines? (This again is usually geared towards a platform that the candidate has the most experience with).What would you do to address the issue?These three topic areas seem to cut to the core of what raw analysis tasks an operations analyst must be able to perform well. The kinds of answers I expect are specific, detailed, and accurate given the scenarios supplied (i.e. application-level attack against a 3-tier windows-based web application merits one kind of response vs. a client-side buffer overflow attack against a web browser, etc.).  Maybe one or two of our candidates out of several dozen have even been able to answer them competently enough for a second round (and they eventually accepted more lucrative offers). I'd even be happy if the candidates could get two out of three. Am I setting the bar too high? Are there some magic keywords in the job req that I'm missing? Am I going to have hire juniors and train them up? Is there even such a thing as a senior operations analyst? My initial response is that the number of people who can independently and competently answer these questions is remarkably small.  Furthermore, the number of shops that are collecting the data necessary to answer these questions is also small.What do blog readers think?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Much of digital security focuses on pre-compromise activities.  Not as much attention is paid to what happens once your defenses fail.  My friend Bamm brought this problem to my attention when he discussed the problem of rating the severity of an incident.  He was having trouble explaining to his management the impact of an intrusion, so he asked if I had given any thought to the issue.What follows is my attempt to apply a framework to the problem.  If anyone wants to point me to existing work, please feel free.  This is not an attempt to put a flag in the ground.  We're trying to figure out how to talk about post-compromise activities in a world where scoring vulnerabilities receives far more attention.This is a list of factors which influence the severity of an incident.  It is written mainly from the intrusion standpoint.  In other words, an unauthorized party is somehow interacting with your asset.  I have ordered the options under each category such that the top items in each sub-list is considered worst, and the bottom is best.   Since this is a work in progress I put question marks in many of the sub-lists.Level of ControlDomain or network-wide SYSTEM/Administrator/rootLocal SYSTEM/Administrator/rootPrivileged user (but not SYSTEM/Administrator/rootUserNone?Level of InteractionShellAPIApplication commandsNone?Nature of ContactPersistent and continuousOn-demandRe-exploitation requiredMisconfiguration requiredNone?Reach of VictimEntire enterpriseSpecific zonesLocal segment onlyHost onlyNature of Victim DataExceptionally grave damage if destroyed/altered/disclosedGrave damage if destroyed/altered/disclosedSome damage if destroyed/altered/disclosedNo damage if destroyed/altered/disclosedDegree of Friendly External Control of VictimNone; host has free Internet access inbound and outboundSome external control of accessComprehensive external control of accessHost Vulnerability (for purposes of future re-exploitationNumerous severe vulnerabilitiesModerate vulnerabilityLittle to no vulnerabilityFriendly Visibility of VictimNo monitoring of network traffic or host logsOnly network or host logging (not both)Comprehensive network and host visibilityThreat AssessmentHighly skilled and motivated, or structured threatModerately skilled and motivated, or semi-structured threatLow skilled and motivated, or unstructured threatBusiness Impact (from continuity of operations plan)HighMediumLowOnsite SupportNoneFirst level technical support presentSkilled operator onsiteBased on this framework, I would be most worried about the following -- stated very bluntly so you see all eleven categories: I worry about an incident where the intruder has SYSTEM control, with a shell, that is persistent, on a host that can reach the entire enterprise, on a host with very valuable data, with unfettered Internet access, on a host with lots of serious holes, and I can't see the host's logs or traffic, and the intruder is a foreign intel service, and the host is a high biz impact system, and no one is on site to help me.What do you think?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Are you secure?  Prove it.  These five words form the core of my recent thinking on the digital security scene.  Let me expand \"secure\" to mean the definition I provided in my first book: Security is the process of maintaining an acceptable level of perceived risk.  I defined risk as the probability of suffering harm or loss.  You could expand my five word question into are you operating a process that maintains an acceptable level of perceived risk?Let's review some of the answers you might hear to this question.  I'll give an opinion regarding the utility of the answer as well.For the purpose of this exercise let's assume it is possible to answer \"yes\" to this question.  In other words, we just don't answer \"no.\"  We could all make arguments as to why it's impossible to be secure, but does that really mean there is no acceptable level of perceived risk in which you could operate?  I doubt it.So, are you secure?  Prove it.Yes. Then, crickets (i.e., silence for you non-imaginative folks.)  This is completely unacceptable.  The failure to provide any kind of proof is security by belief.  We want security by fact.Yes, we have product X, Y, Z, etc. deployed. This is better, but it's another expression of belief and not fact.  The only fact here is that technologies can be abused, subverted, and broken.  Technologies can be simultaneously effective against one attack model and completely worthless against another.Yes, we are compliant with regulation X. Regulatory compliance is usually a check-box paperwork exercise whose controls lag attack models of the day by one to five years, if not more.  A compliant enterprise is like feeling an ocean liner is secure because it left dry dock with life boats and jackets.  If regulatory compliance is more than a paperwork self-survey, we approach the realm of real of evidence.  However, I have not seen any compliance assessments which measure anything of operational relevance.Yes, we have logs indicating we prevented attacks X, Y, and Z. This is getting close to the right answer, but it's still inadequate.  For the first time we have some real evidence (logs) but these will probably not provide the whole picture.  Sure, logs indicate what was stopped, but what about activities that were allowed?  Were they all normal, or were some malicious but unrecognized by the preventative mechanism?Yes, we do not have any indications that our systems are acting outside their expected usage patterns. Some would call this rationale the definition of security.  Whether or not this answer is acceptable depends on the nature of the indications.  If you have no indications because you are not monitoring anything, then this excuse is hollow.  If you have no indications and you comprehensively track the state of an asset, then we are making real progress.  That leads to the penultimate answer, which is very close to ideal.Yes, we do not have any indications that our systems are acting outside their expected usage patterns, and we thoroughly collect, analyze, and escalate a variety of network-, host-, and memory-based evidence for signs of violations. This is really close to the correct answer.  The absence of indications of intrusion is only significant if you have some assurance that you've properly instrumented and understood the asset.  You must have trustworthy monitoring systems in order to trust that an asset is \"secure.\"  If this is really close, why isn't it correct?Yes, we do not have any indications that our systems are acting outside their expected usage patterns, and we thoroughly collect, analyze, and escalate a variety of network-, host-, and memory-based evidence for signs of violations.  We regularly test our detection and response people, processes, and tools against external adversary simulations that match or exceed the capabilities and intentions of the parties attacking our enterprise (i.e., the threat).  Here you see the reason why number 6 was insufficient.  If you assumed that number 6 was ok, you forgot to ensure that your operations were up to the task of detecting and responding to intrusions.  Periodically you must benchmark your perceived effectiveness against a neutral third party in an operational exercise (a \"red team\" event).  A final assumption inherent in all seven answers is that you know the assets you are trying to secure, which is no mean feat.Incidentally, this post explains why deploying a so-called IPS does nothing for ensuring \"security.\"  Of course, you can demonstrate that it blocked attacks X, Y, and Z.  But, how can you be sure it didn't miss something?  If you want to spend the least amount of money to take the biggest step towards Magnificent Number 7, you should implement Network Security Monitoring.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

These are a few I noticed this week.When visiting a jewelry store, I saw a sign say the following: \"Our insurance policy does not permit us to remove more than one item at a time from this display case.\"  This sign was attached to a case containing the store's most valuable jewelry.  This is an example of limiting exposure by restricting access to one asset at a time.  In a more generic sense, the digital version might involve following guidelines applied by an insurance company.  Perhaps they would require WPA2 for wireless networks, etc.I received a check from a client.  Underneath the signature line I read \"Two signatures required for amounts over $75,000.\"  This is an example of dual accountability.  It requires someone writing fraudulent checks to have an accomplice.  The digital version involves requiring two privileged users acting together to accomplish a particularly sensitive task.At many stores I saw video cameras directly above the cash register.  While these might be useful for recording thieves, it is probably in place to deter employees from stealing.  The digital version is comprehensive host- and network-centric monitoring.I think one of the fundamental problems of digital security is the inability to translate historically sound analog security practices into digital forms.  Traditional computer scientists are not security experts.  Traditional security experts are usually not computer scientists.  Addressing this gap would be beneficial to both communities.Can you think of other examples of security measures in the analog world that could be applied to the digital world?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

If you don't know what houses your data (item 1), how that data is transported (item 2), and what data you are trying to protect (item 3), you have little chance of success.  Once you know your environment, you should learn who is trying to exploit your vulnerabilities to steal, corrupt, or deny access to your data (item 4).

        "content": "I managed to get a SNMP v3 trap to work when sending the trap with Debian.  This is important because it confirms a bug was introduced into snmptrap somewhere in the 5.2.x line of Net-SNMP tools.  The version of snmptrap installed by Debian stable is 5.1.2.  Here is what I set up.The Debian host is macmini.  I created /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf with the following.createUser              doit MD5 doitpassword DES doitpasswordWhen I ran snmpd, I saw the user created along with the engine ID for this host.macmini:~# snmpd -f -Lo -DusmusmUser: created a new user doit at 80 00 07 E5 80 54 D7 15 E8 44 FA 12 65 Warning: no access control information configured.  It's unlikely this agent can serve any useful purpose in this state.  Run \"snmpconf -g basic_setup\" to help you configure the snmpd.conf file for this agent.NET-SNMP version 5.1.2This step also created /var/lib/snmp/snmpd.conf with the following:usmUser 1 3 0x800007e58054d715e844fa1265 0x646f697400 0x646f697400 NULL .1.3.6.1.6.3.10.1.1.2  0x7118d87274c4aa4e22c27c003bf92add .1.3.6.1.6.3.10.1.2.2 0x7118d87274c4aa4e22c27c003bf92add \"\"engineBoots 1oldEngineID 0x800007e58054d715e844fa12650x800007e58054d715e844fa1265 is my engine ID.

Everyone recommends using SNMP v3 but it's frustrating to figure it out when facing a bug in snmptrapd.  Net-SNMP tools are really powerful, though.The next challenge is figuring out the access control model in Net-SNMP 5.3.x.  Apparently it's different from 5.2.x.When 5.2.4 is released I plan to test out snmptrap on FreeBSD as well.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "I've spent some time beefing up my At the risk of being attacked for promoting stereotypes or hurting feelings, I decided to share a few thoughts on this subject.  What group describes you?Academics: This group consists of undergraduates, graduates, PhD candidates, and faculty.  They tend to frequent USENIX conferences where they will be talking about the latest security protocol.  They have ties to government organizations because that is the source of grant money.  They write papers, mostly speak in front of other academics, and take deep looks at improving security technologies in formal and peer-reviewed ways.  Academics obviously have formal training and they tend to have tinkered with security before joining this group.Policemen:  (Police women also fit here!)  Policemen enforce the law.  They like to talk about who they have \"busted.\"  They seem to often assume duties for which they are not prepared.  They are overwhelmed by the amount of work they face, even though they are one of the few groups who can eliminate threats.  Their organizations usually consider their work to be secondary to \"real law enforcement.\"  Sometimes their bosses don't even read email.  Policemen tend to struggle to understand technology because they usually come from traditional police backgrounds, and their workload ensures no free time to tinker.  Policemen often concentrate on host-based forensics, and they attend HTCIA and InfraGard conferences.Government civilians and contractors: Government civilians and contractors obsess over certifications.  They are most likely to be talking about CISSP, PMP, ISSAP, ISSEP, GIAC, and so on at ISSA meetings.  They often perform certification and accreditation and don't understand why those processes are broken.  Some of them are trying very hard to fix their agencies, but they struggle with political infighting and bureaucratic inertia.  This group likes SANS and CSI conferences.Warfighters: This is the uniform-wearing military.  This group is youngish and  skilled.  Many of them would fit into the \"hacker\" category (see below) but they are definitely on the white hat side.  They are sharp because their infrastructures are under constant assault.  Unfortunately the military personnel system generally offers no career path to develop their skills and interests.  This group tends to leave the military for the commercial or government worlds just when they are becoming real experts.  Warfighters attend their own closed conferences but they also try to learn from their opponents at offensive-minded conferences like Black Hat or CanSec.Hackers:  To some degree all of the groups here would want to consider themselves \"hackers,\" with the exception of policemen and some government civilians.  (Being a hacker is supposed to be cool, but some consider it to be bad.)  In reality, you know a hacker when you talk to him or her.  Hackers tend to have extremely deep technical knowledge in very specific areas.  A hacker might write his own compiler or debugger, but not practice sound system administration practices.  (For example, a hacker might think it's ok to put all system files in a single partition on a production server.)  Hackers are the source of real public innovation in attack methodologies and they are extremely creative and unpredictable.  Hackers are more likely to speak at conferences like Black Hat or CanSec, but they seem to be migrating to smaller or private gatherings.  Hackers are some of the youngest members of the security community, but as they build families and get older they migrate to another group.  When young they are either in high school or college.  Upon graduation (from either place), hackers usually work as consultants.  Sometimes they work directly for governments or the military.Consultants/Corporates:  This group includes those who work for security companies, and those who provide security services within non-security companies.  Consultants and corporates are a very diverse group, drawing upon most of the earlier categories.  Many corporates have general IT backgrounds and \"end up\" in security because they staff a one- or two-person IT shop.  If they are serious about providing good services, and their employers agree, they tend to specialize in one or two areas.  (Companies who expect consultants and corporates to be experts in everything should expect disaster.)  This group is second to the government civilians and contractors in pursuing certifications, because they think clients will value them or their employers will reward them.Developers: The last group creates security products, but I prefer to concentrate on those who participate in the design process. (Code monkeys who implement without consideration for underlying security principles aren't really security people.)  Security developers are usually former members of the other groups, since serving two roles is too tough.  Developers have decided they want to solve a problem encountered in their previous lives.  They are very skilled in their work area, with depth of knowledge rivalling the hackers.  Some developers are older hackers.Did I miss anyone?Keep in mind that some people may fit in one category while working in another category.  For example, I know many \"hackers\" who are government contractors during their day jobs.  Many consultants are like government civilians or contractors.  Also note I do not consider any of these people to be the adversary.  I will not be discussing threats.I wanted to record these thoughts, because you can probably imagine the diversity of opinion suggested by this list.  I have some ties to each of these groups, and they approach problems from very different angles.  I have no way of knowing the sorts of people who read my blog, but in some ways I'm guessing few hackers, developers, or policemen read it.  I could be wrong though.I would be interested in hearing your thoughts, especially if you can help refine/define these categories.  This is not some sort of formal taxonomy, just some ideas.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Cooper said the department has since fixed that problem.So DoS (heh, pun intended) disabled outbound HTTPS?  It sounds to me like the intruders used a HTTPS covert channel (not so covert, actually) to communicate with their victims.  I think we are getting to the point where encrypted outbound HTTP will have to terminate on a proxy server that permits inspection or at least logging of the HTTP action.  The proxy will then establish its own connection with the remote HTTPS server.  Yes, (1) this breaks end-to-end HTTPS; (2) users will probably have to accept an unexpected SSL certificate; (3) this will undermine any training they may have received to avoid connecting to the uber hacker at   However, to have any shot at identifying these connections in a timely manner, inspection of clear text at the network perimeter is a must.

He observed that small vendors tend to sell products designed for sophisticated users, because large companies tend to sell products for unsophisticated users.  Which market is bigger?  The unsophisticates vastly outnumber the sophisticates.  Therefore, start-ups usually chase a very small market and tend to be weak.Marcus said \"security ROI is dead\" and \"legislation has made security a cost.\"  He predicted \"we will be competing with legal for money (or working for them) in the next five to ten years.\"  To hammer the point Marcus then said \"there never was a security ROI.\"  For a way forward, Marcus offered two paths.  Path A sees multi-level security rising from the ashes.  Marcus claimed this is not likely, although papers like  (.pdf) might beg to differ.  Path B involves the death of general purpose computing.  Everyone will own appliances, perhaps even disposable ones like cell phones.  All data will be on a backend somewhere.  It's a return to mainframe computing that reverses what Marcus called the \"Satanic bargain\" of general purpose computing.  What's the bargain that was made in order to rid the world of mainframes?  \"Everyone becomes a system administrator.\"  Clearly that has not worked.  Marcus said \"distributed data equals distributed vulnerability,\" and the recent public laptop thefts make that clear.Marcus told his audience to watch for a day when they can no longer buy software.  Instead, people will rent and lease \"capabilities,\" not applications.

        "content": "One of the benefits of paying for this week's  was attending a briefing last week on the latest  conducted by the The NSA organizer, or \"white cell leader,\" is Bruce Rogers.  He explained that competitions can be conducted either as capture-the-flag style events or purely defensive affairs.  CDX is purely defensive.  When I asked Mr. Rogers if he had spoken to any organizers of other cyber competitions, like those of Def Con or ShmooCon, he said no.  Mr. Rogers has 20 white controllers overseeing the exercise, which includes 6 targets (the six defending teams -- USAFA, USNA, USMA, USMMA, AFIT, and NPS).  The attackers are split into two groups.  The first group consists of \"tainters\".  These are 13 NSA personnel, which included one high school-age intern and one college-age intern.  The tainters spent about 80 man-hours building and then misconfiguring, rootkitting, and otherwise tampering with virtual machines delivered to the CDX participants.  The participants had two weeks to analyze these VMs for vulnerabilities and exploitation, after which they had to activate and then defend them.  These compromised servers are supposed to be similar to \"host nation machines\" that military personnel might find themselves operating.I was initially shocked by this news.  Who in their right mind would trust host nation equipment for sensitive operations?  Wouldn't it be best to rip everything out and start fresh with clean, trusted media?  After some thought, I decided that this tainting phase was more realistic than I initially believed.  Unless one joins a very small company, no new security or IT employee is ever allowed to begin work at a new job by rebuilding all infrastructure.  When you join a new company, you're stuck with all of the garbage they give you.The second group of attackers are the traditional red team.  This group consists of real red teams from across the services, such as the USAF 92nd Information Warfare Aggressor Squadron.  The red team hammered the 6 target networks for 4 straight days.  The target networks were hosted on live network links at the respective schools and were connected back to NSA via VPN.  No simulated non-malicious traffic was carried to or from the target networks.  Everything on the wire was considered malicious since the red team was creating it.  This is highly unrealistic, but partially driven by the bandwidth available to some of the teams.  At least one hosted their target network on an ISDN line.Each of the military participants said a few words about their teams and experiences.  Three themes stood out.  First, the team size varied widely. USAFA's team had 9 people.  USMA's team had 35-40.  (USAFA won.)  Second, most of the teams admitted having little or no security training.  I was amazed.  Who signs up for a hack-fest without having security experience?  Third, the networks designed by each of the teams varied widely.  USAFA emphasized simplicity.  USNA concentrated upon prevention, and never regained control once their servers were compromised.  (\"Prevention eventually fails.\" -- Tao)  USMA's network was exceedingly complex, but they tried to watch outbound traffic for signs of compromise (e.g., extrusion detection).  No team was allowed to block traffic from malicious IPs.All of the target networks ended up being 0wn3d.  USAFA didn't notice a rogue Apache module that resulted in a Web site defacement.  USMA missed a default password on their router and lost control of it.  The red team said that the best team only found 15% of the vulnerabilities created by the \"tainters.\"  Wow.  By the way, the tainters did not tell the red team what they did to the VMs.  The tainters dropped some clues as the exercise progressed, but the red team mostly used standard penetration techniques.These were the lessons learned from the 2006 CDX.Top 9 Exploited VulnerabilitiesMicrosoft Windows LSASS Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityMicrosoft DCOMLM Hash versus NTLM Authentication ProtocolUse of Weak PasswordsUse of the same password on Multiple SystemsMicrosoft Windows Default Administrative SharesRich Text Format / HTML EmailAccess to System ExecutablesUse of Unnecessary Services / AccountsStudent Best PracticesKnow the Network and Keep it Simple: Each additional device is another avenue of attack.  The entire team must understand the network.  Troubleshooting is easier with a simple design.Deny by Default Policy: Only allow what is absolutely necessary.  It's easier than blocking known bads.Remove Unnecessary Services, Software, and User Accounts:  What is the role of the computer?  Remove unnecessary software completely.Plan for Contingencies: All networks will eventually have a problem.Finally, two of the panel members (I remember USAFA cadet Michael Tanner told this story) participated in CDX and the .

        "content": "Last month's , CISO of the .  Mr. Heretick seemed like a sincere, devoted government employee, so I hope no one interprets the following remarks as a personal attack.  Instead, I'd like to comment on the security mindset prevalent in the US government.  Mr. Heretick's talk sharpened my thoughts on this matter.Imagine a football (American-style) team that wants to measure their success during a particular season.  Team management decides to measure the height and weight of each player.  They time how fast the player runs the 40 yard dash.  They note the college from which each player graduated.  They collect many other statistics as well, then spend time debating which ones best indicate how successful the football team is.  Should the center weigh over 300 pounds?  Should the wide receivers have a shoe size of 11 or greater?  Should players from the north-west be on the starting line-up?  All of this seems perfectly rational to this team.An outsider looks at the situation and says: \"Check the scoreboard!  You're down 42-7 and you have a 1-6 record.  You guys are losers!\"In my opinion, this summarizes the mindset of US government information security managers.Here are some examples from Mr. Heretick's talk.  He showed a \"dashboard\" with various \"metrics\" that supposedly indicate improved DoJ security.  The dashboard listed items like:IRP Reporting: meaning Incident Response Plan reporting, i.e., does the DoJ unit have an incident response plan?  This says nothing about the quality of the IRP.IRP Exercised: has the DoJ unit exercised its IRP?  This says nothing about the effectiveness of the IRT in the exercise.CP Developed: meaning Contingency Plan developed, i.e, does the DoJ unit have a contingency plan should disaster strike?  This also says nothing about the quality of the CP.CP Exercised: has the DoJ unit exercised its CP?  Same story as the IRP.Imagine a dashboard, then, with all \"green\" for these items.  They say absolutely nothing about the \"score of the game.\"How should the score be measured then?  Here are a few ideas, which are neither mutually exclusive nor exceedingly well-thought-out:Days since last compromise of type X: This is similar to a manufacturing plant's \"days since an accident\" report or a highway's \"days since a fatality\" report.  For some sites this number may stay zero if the organization is always compromised.  The higher the number, the better.System-days compromised: This looks at the number of systems compromised, and for how many days, during a specified period.  The lower, the better.Time for a pen testing team of [low/high] skill with [internal/external] access to obtain unauthorized [unstealthy/stealthy] access to a specified asset using [public/custom] tools and [complete/zero] target knowledge: This is from my earlier  story.These are just a few ideas, but the common theme is they relate to the actual question management should care about: are we compromised, and how easy is it for us to be compromised?I explained my football analogy to Mr. Heretick and asked if he would adopt it.  He replied that my metrics would discourage DoJ units from reporting incidents, and that reporting incidents was more important to him than anything else.  This is ridiculous, and it indicates to me that organizations like this (and probably the whole government) need independent, Inspector General-style units that roam freely to assess networks and discover intruders.In short, the style of \"security\" advocated by government managers seems to be \"control-compliant.\"  I prefer \"field-assessed\" security, although I would be happy to replace that term with something more descriptive.  In the latest  (link will work shortly) Alan Paller used the term \"attack-based metrics,\" saying the following about the VA laptop fiasco: \"if the VA security policies are imprecise and untestable, if the VA doesn't monitor attack-based metrics, and if there are no repercussions for employees who ignore the important policies, then this move [giving authority to CISOs] will have no impact at all.\"PS: Mr. Heretick shared an interesting risk equation model.  He uses the following to measure risk.Vulnerability is measured by assessing exploitability (0-5), along with countermeasure effectiveness (0-2).  Total vulnerability is exploitability minus countermeasures.Threat is measured by assessing capability (1-2), history (1-2), gain (1-2),  attributability (1-2), and detectability (1-2).  Total threat is capability plus history plus gain minus attributability minus detectability.Significance (i.e., impact or cost) is measured by assessing loss of life (0 or 4), sensitivity (0 or 4), operational impact (0 or 2), and equipment loss (0 or 2).  Total significance is loss plus op impact plus sensitivity plus equipment loss.Total risk is vulnerability times threat times significance, with 75 very high.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I will teach a brand new, two day course called  (TWS) on 31 July and 1 August 2006.This will be a fun course.  Let me make your expectations perfectly clear, however: the primary purpose of this course is to teach TCP/IP and packet-level analysis.  The intended audience is junior and intermediate security personnel.  We will work our way up the TCP/IP stack over the two day course, using security tools at each layer to provide sample traffic for analysis.  If you walk up to me in class and say \"I know all of these tools.  This isn't cool,\" I will boot you from class!  This is not an \"uber-l33t-h@x0r-t00lz\" course.  Still, I am trying to add tools from off the beaten path to keep things interesting.I will probably create a FreeBSD VM with all or most of the tools I use in the slides.  Students will be free to try those tools, although I may omit the layer 2 attacks.  I do not wish to see MAC spoofing, flooding, and so forth disrupting the USENIX network.  I plan to provide all of the traces analyzed in class, however.  You will want to be sure your laptop is running Ethereal/Wireshark so you can follow along.Assuming the class goes well, I hope to offer it elsewhere -- including to private groups.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

When these machines detect the keyword, they do not actually prevent the packet containing the keyword from passing through the main router (this would be horribly complicated to achieve and still allow the router to run at the necessary speed). Instead, these subsiduary machines generate a series of TCP reset packets, which are sent to each end of the connection. When the resets arrive, the end-points assume they are genuine requests from the other end to close the connection \u2014 and obey.

This is the central argument:[C]omputer networks, particularly the Internet, can be thought of as having immune systems that are strengthened by certain attacks. Exploitation of security holes prompts users and vendors to close those holes, vendors to emphasize security in system development, and users to adopt improved security practices. This constant strengthening of security reduces the likelihood of a catastrophic attack -- one that would threaten national or even global security. In essence, certain cybercrime can create more benefits than costs, and cybercrime policy should take this concept into account.Apparently Harvard lawyers do not take economics classes.  If they did (or paid attention) they would know of .  The story demonstrates that crime, warfare, and other destructure behavior does not benefit society, since it shifts resources from productive behavior towards repair, recovery, and other defensive activities.  The HLR article continues:Cybercrime is also different from other crime because it is amenable to innovative law enforcement approaches that exploit its unique underlying psychology. The objective of a bank robbery is to obtain money. Terrorists usually wish to maximize damage. Cybercrime, however, often provides no financial gain; many cyberattacks seem to originate from a desire for fame and attention or fun and challenge. Hackers often cause little to no permanent damage to the systems they successfully penetrate. This is true even of many high-profile cyber-attacks, in which damage initially appears to be widespread.Wow, was this article published in 1996 or 2006?  \"No financial gain?\"  \"Little to no permanent damage?\"  Welcome to the modern world, HLR.  What would you consider permanent damage -- loss of life?  Everything else can be repaired, even blasts by 2,000 pound bombs.  Money spent on incident response and recovery, future lost revenue from decreased customer trust, insurance payments, spending on infrastructure -- all of this could be avoided in a world without \"beneficial cybercrime.\"Am I being too harsh?

        "content": "Dan Geer published an interesting article in the  issue of .  He questions the utility of converging physical and digital security \"within a common reporting structure.\"  In brief:This observer says convergence is a mirage. The reason is time.  Everything about digital security has time constants that are three orders of magnitude different from the time constants of physical security: break into my computer in 500 milliseconds but into my house in 5 to 10 minutes...That is true, but the value of compromising a system doesn't necessarily come from just getting a root shell.  This is especially true when organized crime, corporate espionage, and foreign intelligence activities are involved.  Achieving the goals of each of those groups usually takes more than a few minutes, with the first taking the least time and the last the most.  Nevertheless, Dan is probably still right.  What he says later is even more compelling:Human-scale time and rate constants underlie the law enforcement model of security. The crime happens and the wheels of detection, analysis, pursuit, apprehension, jurisprudence, and, perhaps, penal servitude... law enforcement generally has all the time in the world, and its opponent, the criminal, thus must commit the perfect crime to cleanly profit from that crime.In the digital world, crime must be prevented; once committed, it's likely never ameliorable -- data is never unexposed, for example. It's not the criminal who must commit the perfect crime but rather the defender who must commit the perfect defense.  Time is the reason.Consequently, the physical world strategies of law enforcement are of limited value in the digital sphere. Law enforcement officials (or the military) are not our natural allies or even mentors.At first I accepted this argument.  Then I thought more closely about it.  Time has nothing to do with this argument.  Preventing crime is the key.  The analog world example makes it sound acceptable that a crime has occurred.  The digital world example makes it sound unacceptable that a crime has occurred -- \"data is never unexposed, for example.\"  Well, death is never reversed if a murder is committed.  For horrible crimes like murder, as with the digital world, in the analog world \"crime must be prevented; once committed, it's likely never ameliorable.\"Geer doesn't see this, but he reaches a conclusion for the digital world that is already happening in the analog:[The] only answer is preemption. Preemption requires intelligence. Intelligence requires surveillance. If, as digital security people, we have any natural allies or even mentors, they're to be found in the intelligence model of security, not the law enforcement model where this talk of \"convergence\" has itself converged.And there we are -- :British authorities have sought to reassure the public that no effort will be spared to prevent further atrocities. For that promise to become a reality, however, London needs to move more from after-the-event analysis to before-the-event anticipation.Intelligence is one way to prevent risks from occurring, to the extent that intelligence can identify threats and direct counter-threat activities.  Removing vulnerabilities is another way to prevent risks from occurring, but that is far more difficult in most circumstances.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Please note that penetration testing is not currently a What do you feel is the most efficient way to determine the scope of a pen test that is appropriate for a given enterprise?  Prior to hiring any pen testers, an enterprise should conduct an asset assessment to identify, classify, and prioritize their information resources.  The (Time for a pen testing team of [low/high] skill with [internal/external] access to obtain unauthorized [unstealthy/stealthy] access to a specified asset using [public/custom] tools and [complete/zero] target knowledge.) one must decide the other variables before hiring a pen testing team.What do you feel is the most efficient way to determine which pen tester(s) to use? First, you must trust the team.  You must have confidence (and legal assurances) they will follow the rules you set for them, properly handle sensitive information they collect, and not use information they collect for non-professional purposes.  Second, you must select a team that can meet the objectives you set.  They should have the knowledge and tools necessary to mirror the threat you expect to face.  I will write more on this later.  Third, I would rely on referrals and check all references a team provides. Do you feel there is any significant value in having multiple third parties perform a pen test? This issue reminds me of the rules requiring changing of financial auditors on a periodic basis.  I believe it is a good idea to conduct annual pen tests, with one team in year one and a second team in year two.  At the very least you can have two experiences from which to draw upon when deciding who should return for year three.Have you had any significant positive/negative experiences with specific pen testers? I once monitored a client who hired a \"pen tester\" to assess the client's network. One weekend while monitoring this client, I saw someone using a cable modem run Nmap against my client.  The next Monday my client wanted to know why I hadn't reported seeing the \"pen test\".  I told my client I didn't consider a Nmap scan to be a \"pen test\".  I soon learned the client had paid something like $5000 for that scan.  Buyer beware!Do you have any additional recommendations as to how to choose a pen tester? Just today I came across what looks like the industry's \"first objective technical grading system for hackers and penetration testers\" -- at least according to  system this way: Participants are tasked to capture the flag in a series of exercises carefully designed to test the depth and the breadth of their skill in various diverse aspects of computer hacking.  Around 15 exercises are completed over the course of two days, after which each participant is awarded a grade reflecting their scores and relative skill levels in each of the areas tested. Each exercise is completely technical in nature.  This sounds very promising. Do you have any literature that you can recommend in regard to pentesting?  I have a few books nearby, namely  (not read yet) and  (liked it, but 4 years old).  The main  series discusses vulnerability assessment, which gets you halfway through a pen test.If I had the time and money I would consider attending , which looks very well organized and stratified.

I ended the day on a panel discussion with Russ Rogers, Marcus Ranum, and Johnny Long, moderated by Ron Gula.  My wife and daughter and I also shared lunch with Kevin Mandia and Julie Darmstadt, both of whom I worked with at Foundstone.This was my second  conference.  I want to record a few thoughts from this conference, especially after hearing Marcus speak yesterday and after joining today's panel discussion.Yesterday Marcus noted that the security industry is just like the diet industry.  People who want to lose weight know they should eat less, eat good food, and exercise regularly.  Instead, they constantly seek the latest dieting fad, pill, plan, or program -- and wonder why they don't get the results they want!Marcus spent some time discussing money spent on security.  He says we are \"spending rocket science dollars but getting faith healer results.\"  He quoted a March 2005 document by  (.pdf) analyzing the security vendor scene.  Kuper claims that the 700 companies estimated to exist in 2005 will compete for $16 billion in revenues in 2008.  That's an average of $22,857,143 per company -- not enough to sustain most players.  When the three \"big boys\" -- Symantec, Cisco, and McAfee -- are removed, that leaves only $11.5 billion for the remaining 697 companies, or only $16,499,283 per company; that's even worse.  Kuper and Marcus believe all security companies are going to end up being owned by Symantec, Cisco, McAfee, or Microsoft, or will go out of business.Finally, I've been following the .  I've discussed the risk equation both in this blog and in my books, so you may wonder why I even mention it if I feel that measuring risk is basically worthless?  The answer is simple.  The risk equation is like the OSI model.  In practical applications, both are worthless.  No one runs OSI protocols, but everyone talks about \"layer 3,\" \"layer 4,\" and so on.  So, the terms are helpful, but the implementation fails.  (By implementation, I mean no one runs  like CLNP.  IS-IS might be an exception, although exceptionally rare.)

        "content": "Donn Parker published an excellent article in the latest issue of  titled Making the Case for Replacing Risk-Based Security.  This article carried a curious disclaimer I had not seen in other articles:This article contains the opinions of the author, which are not necessarily the opinions of the ISSA or the ISSA Journal.I knew immediately I needed to read this article. It starts with a wonderful observation:What are we doing wrong?  Is the lack of support for adequate security linked to our risk-based approach to security? Why can't we make a successful case to management to increase the support for information security to meet the needs?  Part of the answer is that management deals with risk every day, and it is too easy for them to accept security risk rather than reducing it by increasing security that is inconvenient and interferes with business.I would argue that management decides to \"accept security risk\" because they cannot envisage the consequences of security incidents.  I've written However, Donn Parker's core argument is the following:CISOs have tried to justify spending resources on security by claiming that they can manage and reduce security risks by assessing, reporting, and controlling them. They try to measure the benefits of information security \"scientifically\" based on risk reduction.  This doesn't work... I propose that intangible risk management and risk-based security must be replaced with practical, doable security management with the new objectives of due diligence, compliance consistency, and enablement.I agree.  Here is a perfect example of the problem:One CISO told me [Parker] that he performs risk assessment backwards. He says that he already knows what he needs to do for the next five years to develop adequate security. So he creates some risk numbers that support his contention. Then he works backwards to create types of loss incidents, frequencies, and impacts that produce those numbers. He then refines the input and output to make it all seem plausible. I suggested that his efforts are unethical since his input data and calculations are all fake. He was offended and said that I didn't understand. The numbers are understood by top management to be a convenient way to express the CISO's expert opinion of security needs. This is my question: what makes these shenanigans possible?  Remember the risk equation (Risk = Threat X Vulnerability X Asset Value) and consider these assertions:Hardly anyone can assess threats.Few can identify vulnerabilities comprehensively.Some can measure asset value.As a result, there is an incredible amount of \"play\" in the variables of the risk equation.  Therefore, you can make the results anything you want -- just as the example CISO shows.  It is tough enough to assign values to threats and vulnerabilities, even if time froze.  In the real world, threats are constantly evolving and growing in number, while new vulnerabilities appear in both old and new software and assets on a daily basis.  A network that looked like it held a low risk of compromise on Monday could be completely prone to disaster on Tuesday when a major new vulnerability is found in a core application.Parker's alternative includes the following:Due diligence: We can show management the results of our threat and vulnerability analysis (using examples and scenarios) by giving examples of the existence of the ulnerabilities and solutions that others have employed (not including estimated intangible probabilities and impacts).  Then we can show them easily researched benchmark comparisons of the state of their security relative to other well-run enterprises and especially their competitors under similar circumstances. We then show them what would have to be done to adopt good practices and safeguards to assure that they are within the range of the other enterprises.Bottom line: be as good as the next guy.Compliance: We are finding that the growing body of security compliance legislation such as SOX, GLBA, and HIPAA and the associated personal and corporate liability of managers is rapidly becoming a strong and dominant security motivation...(The current legislation is poorly written and has a sledgehammer effect as written by unknowing legislative assistants but will probably improve with experience, as has computer crime legislation.)Bottom line: compliance has turned out to be the major incentive I've seen for security initiatives.  I am getting incident response consulting work because clients do not want to go to jail for failing to disclose breaches.Enablement: It is easily shown in products and services planning that security is required for obvious and competitive purposes and from case studies, such as the Microsoft experience of being forced by market and government pressures to build security into their products after the fact.Bottom line: this is the weakest argument of the three, and maybe why it is last.  Microsoft may be feeling the heat, but it took five years and the situation is still rough.  Oracle is now under fire, but how long will it take for them to take security seriously?  And so on.I think Donn Parker is making the right point here.  He is saying  and the legions of security firms providing \"risk assessments\" are not happy.  Of course they're not -- they can deliver a product that has bearing on reality and receive money for it!  That's consequence-free consulting.  Try doing that in an incident response scenario where failure to do your job means the intruder remains embedded in a client's infrastructure.As security professionals I agree we are trying to reduce risk, but trying to measure it is a waste of time.  I am sad to think organizations spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on pricey risk assessments and hardly any money on real inspection of network traffic for signs of intrusions.  The sorts of measurements I recommend are performance-based, as I learned in the military.  We determine how good we are by drilling and exercising capabilities, preferably against a simulated enemy.  We don't write formulas guestimating our defense posture.This is not the last I have to say on this issue, but I hope to be boarding a flight soon.  I commend The ISSA Journal for publishing an article that undermines a pillar of their approach to security.  I bet (ISC)2 will also love Donn's approach.  :)Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I like reading FCW because it gives me some insight into the madness found inside the Beltway.I enjoyed reading , which discussed DoD's plans for certifying IT staff.  I've Alan Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, said DOD should have no problem meeting its initial target of 80,000-plus employees trained and accredited in information assurance. But he doesn\u2019t think the baseline certification that DOD requires will produce a workforce capable of securing the military\u2019s systems.\u201cThe problem is that the bulk of the certifications don\u2019t teach people how to do security,\u201d Paller said. \u201cCertified people will be able to talk about security, but they won\u2019t know how to do it \u2014 to actually encrypt data and do the necessary work.\u201dInstead, DOD needs a way to evaluate actual information assurance work, Paller said. That requires hand-on training and scenario-based testing, he added.Alan is absolutely right.  A DoD certification program which accepts the CISSP as the top technical certification indicates the program designers are absolutely clueless.Speaking of clueless:Robert Lentz, DOD\u2019s director of information assurance, said he respects Paller\u2019s opinion but is not worried that the program is headed in the wrong direction. The important thing is to get baseline certifications awarded and then work from there, Lentz said.Assuming the reported depicted Mr. Lentz's words accurately, I am extremely disappointed by this opinion.  This attitude sounds to me like the following: \"Who cares if our program is wrong?  Let's just get it started.\"  That is a recipe for failure, especially considering this quote from the article:DOD\u2019s success with IA training and certification could have wider implications, said Jim Flyzik, president of the Flyzik Group, a consulting firm.

Since I don't run Windows servers in production environments, I can usually ignore such advice.

This was debated , actually.A lesson I learned from the excellent book  is that \"defense-in-depth\" is not a cost-free justification for security measures.  Every configuration and installation aspect of a system provides benefits as well as costs.

If that's not scary, I don't know whatis.Here's a scarier thought: that is standard practice.  Everyone does it.(Paller): The \"clearance first\" policies of many agencies has led them to make people who have never secured a system responsible for telling people how to secure systems. In other agencies, contractors with abominable delivery records are being kept on, over the objections of those who take security seriously, because the ineffective contractors have people with clearances.Another scary thought: these same clearance-holding contractors are exchanged between employers when the employee decides to switch jobs.Incidentally, I put security officer in quotes when I mentioned the term earlier.

They hold a lot of clearances but generally do not use the information in a productive manner.  These sorts of people can be in demand due to the clearances they hold, but they bring absolutely no expertise to technical problems.

A new philosophy of innovation and productivity is being born. Here\u2019s what CIOs need to do to usher in a new age of IT.Excuse me?  IT as a service is already dying?  I know plenty of shops who are only now jumping on the service bandwagon.  I guess magazines like CIO have an incentive to write about whatever they consider to be \"new,\" since people want to stay \"on the edge.\"  Let's see what advice this article provides.The Postmodern IT Department will be smaller, more distributed and dependent on a tightly integrated supply chain of vendors. It will be in desperate need of multitalented specialists who have in-depth technology knowledge but who can also create new products and capabilities that businesspeople might never have envisioned.Yuck.  \"Postmodern\" is a horrible name.  What comes next -- PostPostmodern?  Here's another buzzword -- \"multitalented specialists\".  Let's hear more about this in the sidebar, :While CIOs increasingly demand that their programmers understand the business, they\u2019re also asking for a deeper knowledge of new technologies.While everyone agrees that IT needs generalists today, a more accurate term might be multi-specialists. Programmers who remain solely programmers will have to be highly specialized and extremely skilled to survive against international competition. Meanwhile, other jobs in IT will require at least a solid grounding in programming, along with a strong specialization in other skills, such as project management and business process (probably both).Let me get this straight.  IT people are expected to be technical experts and business experts?  We're supposed to \"have in-depth technology knowledge\" and simultaneously \"create new products and capabilities\"?  This attitude really bugs me:\"You can\u2019t say, \u2018I can manage but I can\u2019t do,\u2019\" says Verizon CIO Shaygan Kheradpir.Is that true, Mr.  Kheradpir?  As a CIO you obviously manage.

You give up?  So sorry!I think the people who write these articles and the CIOs who feed these unrealistic expectations should remember  and his ideas of division of labor.  You cannot expect someone, especially in IT, to be an expert in everything.  \"Multitalented specialists\" is another term for \"someone who can do the job of two or more people, allowing me to further cut my IT staff.\"I spend almost all of my professional time staying current on issues involving network security monitoring, and I struggle like everyone else to make sense of the new threats, vulnerabilities, and assets which comprise the risk equation.

        "content": "If you've been following the last few days of posts, I've been thinking about security from a more general level.  I've been wondering how we can mitigate risks in a digital world where the following features are appearing in nearly every digital device.Think about digital devices in your possession and see if you agree with this characterization of their development.  Digital devices are increasingly:Autonomous:  This means they act on their own, often without user confirmation.  They are self-updating (downloading patches, firmware) and self-configuring (think zeroconf in IPv6).  Users could potentially alter this behavior, but probably not without breaking functionality.Powerful:  A cell phone is becoming as robust as a laptop.  Almost any platform will be able to offer a shell to those who can solicit it .  There is no way to prevent this development -- and would we really want to?Ubiquitous:  Embedded devices are everywhere.  You cannot buy a car without one.  I expect my next big home appliance to have network connectivity.  Users can't do much about some of these developments.Connected:  Everything will be assigned an IPv4 (or soon) an IPv6 address.  Distance is seldom a problem.  Every digital maniac is a few hops away. Complex:  I am scared by the thought of running  on my next phone.  Can I avoid it?  Probably not.  How many lines of code are running on that mini-PC -- I mean \"phone\" -- I'll be using?In my opinion, this digital world is increasingly resembling the analog one.  In fact, those five attributes could describe people as easily as complex machines!The key factor in this new world will not be static vulnerabilities, but dynamic threats.  The number of opportunities for threats to play havoc will vastly dwarf the chances for defenders to address vulnerabilities.Think about how we deal with security in a typical city.  I call it the \"local police model.\"Police can never prevent all crimes, although they can try.Police more often respond to crimes.  They proceed to track and jail criminals.By prosecuting criminals, the justice system removes threats.No one spends time or money putting bars on windows or replacing door locks in the average suburban neighborhood.Crime still happens, but society survives as long as the level of crime is acceptable.Why did a police model rise?  Back in the cave man days, we lived in tribes.  If you didn't belong to my tribe, I could beat you back with my club.  As societies evolved, communication and ties between tribes prevented this simple model from working.  More sophisticated threats with ingenious attacks (e.g., white collar crime) took advantage of these social ties.  Guess what -- this is where we are now in the digital world.  Once upon a time you might have been able to restrict access based on trusted IPs.  Then you had to shut down ports that couldn't be shared.  Now we do business with everyone, and I can't be sure that the Microsoft SMB/CIFS that I'm exchanging with a business partner is normal or malicious when I use a standard access control device.  A threat-centric approach to security has served the analog world well enough.  I think that is the only way to move forward as the digital world becomes as complex as the analog.One more thought: The number of assets continues to rise.  The number of vulnerabilities in those assets continues to rise.  The number of threats continues to rise.  The ability of security experts to apply countermeasures can not keep pace with this world.  Is it time for autonomous agents to work on behalf of \"the good guys?\"  I am beginning to agree with 's idea of nematodes that act on behalf of human agents.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for humans to even understand the digital environment.  The only real way to know exploitation is not possible is for exploitation to be tried and then found to fail.  Nematode agents may roam the network constantly testing intrusion scenarios and reporting their progress.  Perhaps next-generation detection devices will monitor nematode activity.  When they see another agent that is not a registered nematode exploit a target, that will be the sign that an intrusion has occurred.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "If you were to pass the dark alley in the image at left, I doubt you would want to enter it.  You could imagine all sorts of nasty encounters that might deprive you of property, limb, or life.  Yet, few people can imagine the sorts of danger they encounter when using a public PC terminal, or connecting to a wireless access point, or visiting a malicious Web site with a vulnerable browser.This is the problem with  that I discussed earlier this week.  Furthermore, security in the analog world is much threat-centric.  If I'm walking near or in a dark alley, and I see a shady character, I sense risk.  I don't walk down the street checking myself for vulnerabilities, ignoring the threats watching me.  (\"Exposed neck?  Could get hurt there.  Bare hands?  Might get burnt by acid.\"  Etc...)  It seems like the digital security model is like an unarmed combatant in a war zone.  Survivability is determined solely by vulnerability exposure, the attractiveness of one's assets to a threat, and any countermeasures that might disrupt threats.  In the analog world, one can employ a variety of tactics to improve survivability.  Avoiding risky areas is the easiest, but let's assume one has to enter dangerous locations.  A potential victim could arm himself, either using a weapon or martial arts.  He could travel in groups, hire a bodyguard, or enlist the police's aid.  The term \"hack-back\" crops up in the digital scenario.  This is really not a useful approach, because hacking the system attacking you does absolutely nothing to address the real threat -- the criminal at the keyboard.  In the analog world, consider the consequences for \"hacking back.\"  If you shoot an assailant, you'll have to explain yourself to the police or potentially a court of law.  You probably can't shoot someone for simply being on your property, but you can if they threaten or try to harm you.On a related note, we need some means to estimate threat level in a systematic, repeatable manner.  When I say \"threat\" I mean threat, not vulnerability.  Something like a system of distributed honeypots with distinct configurations might be helpful.  Time-to-exploit for a given patch set might be tracked.  I know the  periodically issues reports on how long it takes to 0wn a box, but it might be neat to see this in a regular, formal manner.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "So-called intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are all the rage.  Since the  declaring intrusion detection systems (IDS) dead, the IPS has been seen as the \"natural evolution\" of IDS technology.  If you can detect an attack, goes a popular line of reasoning, why can't (or shouldn't) you stop it?  Here are a few thoughts on this issue.People who make this argument assume that prevention is an activity with zero cost or down side.  The reality is that the prevention action might just as easily stop legitimate traffic.  Someone has to decide what level of interruption is acceptible.  For many enterprises -- especially those where interruption equals lost revenue -- IPS is a non-starter.  (Shoot, I've dealt with companies that tolerated known intrusions for years because they didn't want to \"impact\" the network!)If you're not allowed to interrupt traffic, what is the remaining course of action?  The answer is inspection, followed by manual analysis and response.  If a human decides the problem is severe enough to warrant interruption, then a preventative measure is deployed.In some places, prevention is too difficult or costly.  I would like to know how one could use a network-based control mechanism to stop a host A on switch X from exploiting host B on switch X.  Unless the switch itself enforces security controls, there is no way to prevent this activity.  However, a sensor on switch X's SPAN port could detect and report this malicious activity.Note that I think we will see this sort of access control move into switches.  It's another question whether anyone will activate these features.  I think traffic inspection is best used at boundaries between trusted systems.  Enforcement systems make sense at boundaries between trusted and untrusted systems.  Note that if you don't trust individual hosts inside your organization (for whatever reason), you should enforce control on a per-host basis within the access switch.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "As I continue through my list of security notes, I thought I would share a few ideas here.  I recorded these while seeing Ron Gula discuss vulnerability management at Many people recommend automated patching, at least for desktops.  In the enterprise, some people believe patches should be tested prior to rollout.  This sounds like automated patching must be disabled.  I'm wondering if anyoen has implemented delayed automated patching.  In other words, automatic updates are enabled, but with a two or three day delay.  Those two or three days give the enterprise security group time to test the patch.  If everything is ok, they let the automated patch proceed.  If the patch breaks something critical, they instruct the desktops to not install the patch until further orders.  I think this approach strikes a good balance since I would prefer to have automated patch installation be the default tactic, not manual installation.Determining which systems are vulnerable results in imagining a continuum of assessment tactics.  At the most unobtrusive level we have a \"paper review\" of an inventory of systems and their reported patch levels.Next comes passive assessment of traffic to and from clients and servers.Traditional vulnerability scanning, without logging in to the target, is the next least obtrusive way to assess hosts.Logging in to a host with credentials is another option.Installing an agent on the host is a medium-impact approach.Exploiting the host is the final way to definitively see if a host is vulnerable.On a related note, Ron mentioned that the costs of demonstrating compliance far exceed those of maintaining compliance.  This is sad.  Ron also noted he believes auditors should work for the CFO and not the CIO.  I agree.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

As I was reviewing my notes, I remembered one true case of ROSI: the film .  If you've never seen it, you're in for a treat.  It's amazing that this masterpiece is only separated by four years from Swayze's other classic, . (Best A member of an elite paramilitary organization: \"Eagle Scouts.\")In Road House, Swayze plays a \"cooler\" -- a bouncer who cleans up unruly bars.  He's hired to remove the riff raff from the \"Double Deuce,\" a bar so rough the band is protected by a chicken wire fence!  I personally would have hired Jackie Chan, but that's a story for another day.  Swayze's character indeed fights his way through a variety of local toughs, in the process allowing classier and richer patrons to frequent the Double Deuce.  The owner clearly sees a ROSI; the money he pays Swayze is certainly less than the amount he now receives from a more upscale establishment.  Is there a lesson to be drawn for the digital security world?  Notice the focus on threats.  The Double Deuce owner didn't hire Swayze to build higher walls or cover windows with iron bars.  Instead of addressing vulnerabilities, he sought threat removal.  This is not a process the average company can implement; usually law enforcement and intelligence agencies have this power.I have heard the term \"friendly force presence\" being used within certain military circles.  This seems to refer to keeping assessment teams on the lookout for indications of the adversary on our networks.  This certainly works in the physical world, but it may be difficult to translate into the virtual one.  One example: when I visited Ottawa recently, I stopped at a McDonald's to get a quick meal.  The place was teeming with teenagers, most of whom were just lounging around.  I considered leaving because the place was so full.  I saw a manager appear a few minutes after I arrived, and with him came a uniformed police officer.  The officer had a word with one or two of the larger teens and suddenly the restaurant started to empty.  Within five minutes hardly anyone was left, and no one under the age of 18.  It was amazing.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "The  issue of  features an article called .  It addresses the rise of electronic data discovery (eDiscovery in some quarters) tools.  For a management magazine, the article makes several useful points:Beware the Forensics LabelMany salespeople attach the label \"forensics\" to their security and compliance analysis tools, and that can be very misleading. In law enforcement circles, \"forensics\" means a well-defined set of discovery and investigative processes that hold up in court for civil or criminal proceedings. An enterprise that relies on these tools' records or analysis in, for example, a wrongful termination suit, is probably in for an unpleasant surprise. \"It may not hold up in court,\" says Schwalm, a former Secret Service agent. \"Very few vendors have an idea of what the requirements [are for proof, from a legal perspective]. They're really providing just a paper trail. You should challenge what the vendor means by \u2018forensics capability,'\" he adds.One gotcha of using EDD tools for legal purposes is proving the inviolability of the data. Tools that keep or aggregate event logs may not provide access control that lets the enterprise prove that the underlying data is unaltered and accurate.This issue is particularly critical because most vendors pitch their EDD tools as a way of detecting internal threats. Yet an insider is in the best position to access and alter data to cover his tracks or deflect blame to someone else, making truly secure access control and data management policies a must to even consider relying on EDD tools in a legal case. To thwart insider manipulations, critical functions such as setting up new vendors or changing payment destinations should require multiple levels of approval. \"One person shouldn't be minding the whole store,\" says 2Checkout's Denman.A related concern is being able to go back to the original raw data, since most EDD tools alter the original data to put it into a searchable database and to make formats from different types of monitoring appliances consistent. Such regularization is necessary to analyze the records, but to be legally effective, there must be a defensible way to show that it didn't distort the original data, says Gartner's Litan. (emphasis added)Amen.  Since we're talking about centralized logs, has anyone tried To hear a vendor's take on the important of electronic data discovery tools, John Patzakis from  wrote a good article called  (.pdf, In 2006, companies will spend $2 billion on eDiscovery services, and that figure is expected to climb to $3 billion in 2007... corporate information security can play a very key role in solving this critical problem by dramatically reducing costs and improving compliance... According to standard price lists from top eDiscovery providers, a company can expect to pay $11,000 to $15,000 for the processing of a single hard drive...A key reason for these high costs involves the traditional role of outside counsels who represent the company and typically oversee and manage the eDiscovery process on a per-case basis. These law firms habitually rely on their own consultants to handle the eDiscovery needs of the case at hand, and both the law firm and their consultants typically approach the issue as a case-specific litigation support project. Thus, the focus is on addressing the immediate case, and not on solving the end client\u2019s long-term problems by establishing a systematic methodology...When a company transitions from outsourced eDiscovery to establishing a largely in-house process, the cost savings are dramatic. Many major organizations are now saving tens of millions of dollars in \u201chard\u201d out-of-pocket costs annually when they turn to their internal resources and enterprise class computer investigation technology to collect, search and process computer data for eDiscovery.In other words, buy  in Lake Las Vegas, NV.

ChoicePoint has indicated that the Federal Trade Commission is \"conducting an inquiry into our compliance with federal laws governing consumer information security and related issues.\"In this It's created a media frenzy; this has been mislabeled a hack and a security breach.

        "content": "I ran across some thought-provoking articles in the .  The  summarizes a major problem with calculating IT spending:As sophisticated as the technology and its countless uses have become, all too often the benchmark used to determine the proper level of an enterprise\u2019s IT spending is alarmingly simplistic: the percentage of overall revenue for which IT accounts...Benchmarking IT spending as a percentage of revenue is a truly useless metric. Unfortunately, according to Koch [mentioned next], it remains the most popular way to evaluate IT spending, and also unfortunately (as most of you already know), it doesn\u2019t say anything about how effective or productive your spending is. Even more unfortunately, benchmarking by percentage of revenue casts IT in the role of a cost to be controlled, defining success simply as lowering the percentage over time.This is a really amazing insight.  How many of you see progress in security management through the eyes of reducing spending to zero?  The \"Koch\" mention refers to the article  by Christopher Koch.  As you might guess there is really no simplistic way to solve this problem.  Koch's article includes gems like the following, though:Joe Drouin... found that [his] company was spending less on IT as a percent of overall revenue than the industry average, which was about 1.5 to 2 percent.Not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, Drouin played the metric for everything it was worth, highlighting it in every PowerPoint presentation he could during his first year as CIO...At one point, the CEO, who believed that inexpensive IT was good IT, joked that he expected to see Drouin and his staff outfitted with T-shirts that had the percentage stamped across their chests in big, block numbers...In this zero sum game, success is defined simply as lowering the percentage over time. \"It's not clear how low it should go,\" says Drouin. \"Joking with the CEO, I said, 'In your mind it should be zero.' We had a good laugh, but at what point do we decide it's at the right level and you don't drive it down further?\"That CEO's attitude disgusts me.  Would you expect him to do the same for the human resources department?  They don't bring in any customer revenue.  How about finance and accounting?  Now that creative bookkeeping can put the CEO is jail, that isn't a place that brings in customer revenue either.  Yet, neither \"cost center\" is expected to reduce its percentage of overal revenue to zero.At least as far as security goes, the inability to see the value of security spending relates to management's inability to perceive the risk of being exposed and vulnerable.  I came across this insight in a recent issue of the  (subscription probably required):This acute sensitivity to losses is not the only bias behaviouralists have discovered. People also have great difficulty understanding risks. The weight a person gives to a scenario\u2014flood, fire, winning the lottery\u2014should depend on its likelihood. In fact, it depends on how easily it can be envisaged. People will pay more for air-travel insurance against \"terrorist acts\" than against death from \"all possible causes.\" Canny governments can work with the grain of this psychology. The grisly campaigns against smoking aim to put the dangers firmly in people's minds; to turn a statistical risk into a visceral image. They have been effective, perhaps too effective. There is some evidence that people now overestimate the risks of smoking. (emphasis added)In other words, management cannot imagine the destruction caused by security incidents.  It is impossible for them to envisage an incident causing their company losing market share, intellectual property, or its ability to provide services.  As a result, they base their decisions on laws, regulations, and what their peers are doing.  This explains the resources poured into worm defense a few years ago.  When management's own computers are affected, when they see worm reporting on CNN, when a worm is the discussion over lunch -- they start to take the problem seriously.  When a stealthy intruder has lodged himself inside a company, management has no clue how to handle the situation.  In fact, most management has no clue how to handle existing rogue employees now.  They turn to platitudes like \"we trust our employees\" because they can't fathom why someone would turn against their beloved company.  After all, management has been treated really well!I don't think spending-related metrics are of much use.  Performance-related metrics are the only ones which I think have some value.  Drilling network security operations teams (preventers, intrusion detectors, incident responders, etc.) to see if they stop, identify, and remove controlled threat simulators (vulnerability assessors, pen testers and red teams) is the best way to see if your money is being well spent.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I want to make note of those I found interesting.The March 2006 issue of  featured a cool article on .  I found the first section the most helpful, since it differentiates between multithreading and hyperthreading.  I remember when the FreeBSD development team was criticized for devoting so many resources to SMP.  Now it seems SMP will be everywhere.In the same issue Ed Nisley writes about .  I call out this article for this quote:Mechanical and civil engineers must consider how their projects can fail, right at the start of the design process, by calculating the stress applied to each component and the strength required to withstand it. Electrical engineers apply similar calculations to their circuits by considering voltage, current, and thermal ratings. In each case, engineers determine the project's expected behavior based on well-known properties of the bulk material and the finished components.Software design isn't engineering simply because it does not deal with physical materials that have known properties. Software components don't exhibit a graded response to increasing stress: A single, trivial, data-dependent error can cause complete, instantaneous failure with no prior warning. Programs simply don't have a well-defined safe operating area.If that's true, we're finished.  I'm afraid it may be, but also in the same DDJ issue we read these comments on  by Gregory V. Wilson:[W]hile Stepanek [Bejtlich: author of a book reviewed by Wilson] refers to many of the classic works in software engineering, he seems to have missed most of what's appeared in the primary literature in the last 10 years. New journals such as  have both reflected, and encouraged, new studies of what actually works and doesn't\u2014studies that are methodologically sounder than many of their predecessors\u2014and I think they ought to be required reading for anyone writing about software engineering today. I share Stepanek's sense of frustration, but think that software engineering isn't as special as it is often convenient for software engineers to believe.I agree with that statement.  I find too many people use the term \"art\" to make themselves feel special.  If they took the time to document their approaches (analysis, administration, coding, pen testing, reverse engineering, etc.) they would find their processes repeatable and far less \"special.\"  Science is boring; art is cool.  Science can also be automated, which could mean replacing humans.

I saw rootkits on Solaris eight years ago that are better than most everything that's published today.  Sites like rootkit.com have helped defenders because they give us a clue as to what the bad guys are already doing.  Rootkits expose the broken host protection model offered by vendors like McAfee.

I thought Tutorial was a great, concise (267 pages including index) MySQL overview. I hoped The Definitive Guide to MySQL 5, 3rd Ed (DG, 748 pages) would extend my understanding of MySQL beyond the coverage in the Tutorial. Unfortunately, I found the Tutorial did a better job addressing important information than the DG. While there is some good information in the DG, I recommend staying with books published by MySQL Press.I currently have 205 reviews at Amazon.com.  Eight of those are non-tech books.

First, she promotes VMware's  (VMDK) as an open alternative to Microsoft's  (VHD).  I would obviously like to see an open standard prevail against a closed one.Second, she argues discusses \"the question of whether virtualization should be tightly integrated into the operating system or instead a separate wholly independent layer.\"  As you might guess she wants separation: \"Tight integration comes at the unfortunate cost of giving up bias-free choice of operating system and thus software stack (i.e. OS and application program).\"This is the Web browser-in-the-OS argument all over again.  Microsoft said  that \"Microsoft will build virtualization capabilities into the Windows platform based on Windows hypervisor technology, planned for availability in the next product wave of the Windows operating system, code-named Windows 'Longhorn.' This integrated hypervisor technology in the Windows operating system will be designed to provide customers with a high-performance virtualization solution for Windows and heterogeneous environments.\"Everyone's doing it.  Check out 's initiatives, which include .  FreeBSD is also bringing Xen into its source tree, probably for FreeBSD 7.0 but maybe 6.2.  You might also consider virtualization to be like a TCP/IP stack.  I remember installing  on Windows 3.1 so I could dial-in to the Internet in the early 1990s.  Now every OS ships with a TCP/IP stack.With word that  is delayed until 2007, like Vista and Office 2007, the only question is Microsoft's ability to execute.  I consider VMware to be the leader in the virtualization space.  Will there come a day, however, when I'll just use the built-in virtualization technology on Windows instead of adding a third-party product?  Maybe.  Then again, I'm posting these ideas in Firefox -- not IE.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I'd like to record two notes about how I got this system running Debian with the 2.4 kernel.First, the Dell PowerEdge 2300 uses a Megaraid RAID system that is not supported by the 2.6 kernel that ships with Debian.  I couldn't get the 2.4 version of the installation process to recognize the RAID either, meaning Debian didn't see a hard drive on which to install itself.  I found sites like  and considered using custom .iso's for installation.  Luckily I found a much simpler solution.During the installation, after the hardware check failed to find my hard drive, I ran the following commands.cd /lib/modules/2.4.27-2-386/kernel/drivers/scsiinsmod megaraid.oThat allowed the Megaraid to be recognized, after which a hardware re-check found the RAID and permitted installing the OS.I had to re-run the install several times.  At one point I was getting coredumps during package installation.  I originally made progress using the 'expert' installation, which allowed me to select a SMP kernel.  At my last reboot I didn't select that option and instead used the standard 'linux' install.  That put a non-SMP kernel on my system.  I was able to apt-get my way to a SMP kernel, so that didn't cause much trouble.Second, as far as installing VMware Server Beta went, I used the newest 22874 version and followed my own Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

They're lucky the trains stopped running rather than keep running -- into each other.\"The network switch was not supposed to get overloaded,'' Johnson said. \"It is not supposed to crash. But we shouldn't have been working on (the computer system) while trains were running.\"Johnson described the technicians who caused the crash as conscientious workers who were frustrated by problems caused by the installation of new software on Monday and Tuesday. The software upgrade is intended to be more reliable and secure and to allow BART to limit problems instead of having them affect the entire system.\"We had some folks who have a long record of installing (software) components correctly and are proud of having very few problems,\" Johnson said. \"When they had two, they wanted to get them fixed as soon as possible.

        "content": "My friend John Ward So basically, all this does is open a Bitmap file, decode the stenography message, and pass the resulting message to the protocol class for handling. More sophisticated techniques can be employed, and steganography has grown as a field, so different graphics formats, MP3 files, or even specially encoded HTML headers can contain the message. This deviates from the traditional botnet where the client connects to an IRC channel or some other central media to receive commands in real time. In this method, the attacker loses real-time response and gains stealth. With a reasonable interval of time set for the clients, the attacker can have their nefarious commands executed in a short amount of time. By combining this code with some disguised distribution method, lets say an image thumb-nail browser for an online graphics catalog, the program can be distributed widely, and its online image grabbing behavior would never be suspect until the mass traffic adding to a DDOS attack came from the client machine. And even if it were, your normal Net-Sec analyst would only see an image file and have no clue that the image file contained a steganography-encoded message.Neat idea John -- is anyone seeing this in the wild?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Tom Gallagher, author of the forthcoming , sent the following in reply to my  post:Hello Richard.  Last weekend I read your blog about Microsoft BlueHat and our security books and thought you might be interested in some more information about these topics.I joined the company almost 7 years ago.  In that time, I've seen some major changes happen around how the company views security.  As you are aware, the company didn't focus much on security back then.  I was one of the few people at the company who did fulltime penetration testing.  I worked on a small product team within Microsoft Office and was responsible for testing only it.  Today things are very different.  In Office's vision document for the release, the first tenet is about the importance of security.  Unlike when I started, security is now the responsibility of everyone creating the software - not just the person writing the code, but also the people who design, test, and document it.  Other products across the company do similar things.  We're certainly not perfect, but are working harder and harder to get better.As you noticed, we proactively try to learn about security issues from external researchers and bring them to Redmond to present to the product teams.  The cool thing about this is it allows many people to get direct exposure to the information.  For example, I can't justify sending everyone on my team to a security conference twice a year, but I can send them to BlueHat that often.  We continue to send people to external conferences too.  Since security is everyone's responsibility, people who don't work on security fulltime also attend BlueHat.  It is unlikely that those people would attend external security conferences often.I'm one of the authors of an upcoming MSPress title ().  This book allows feature testers to understand how to find security bugs in their product.   is for developers to understand how to create secure software; the testing book teaches testers how to ensure that carefully probing for vulnerabilities.  Both books cover a wide variety of topics.  And of course testers aren't limited to the people who work on the team creating the software.If you have any questions for Tom, please post them here.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I've written about OMB's FISMA implementation basically boils security down to paperwork exercises, and score card pressure ensures it stays that way.

(emphasis added)Did I read \"real-time monitoring\"?  Wow.  Mr. Brody \"gets it.\"  Consider the alternative point of view:FISMA has its defenders. An agency fully compliant with FISMA is a secure agency, says Scott Charbo, Homeland Security Department CIO. The law and cybersecurity are \"the same thing in my mind,\" he says.I see.  Reading the DHS'  shows they have a perfect F record for the last three years.  Just because DHS is in a sorry state and its scores are an F doesn't mean that an agency with straight A's is secure!Let's get back to monitoring.

If you have no idea what is happening in your enterprise, how can you expect to \"secure\" it?  It doesn't even make sense to figure out what systems you have before you start monitoring.  When you start watching traffic, intruders will show you your systems.

The book presents research conducted by Secure Science Corporation as a way to understand the adversary.

Peron wrote to me about Let's say that you have a GigE copper tap, and you have the two monitor cables coming into the FreeBSD network analyzer on interfaces em0 and em1. You can aggregate the two links into one logical bridge interface to monitor them:ifconfig bridge0 createifconfig bridge0 addm em0 addm em1 uptcpdump -i bridge0This basically turns em0 and em1 into switch ports. If you want to use this bridge specifically to aggregate one or more network interfaces and pass the packets off to BPF and return, then you can turn off the bridging functionality.ifconfig bridge0 monitorThis prevents the bridge code from looking up which port a certain hardware address is attached to, or broadcasting packets out all ports in the event it doesn't know. Essentially, it short circuits the bridging code, which saves a number of mutex acquisitions, list traversals, reducing the load.We have done this in places which use firewall clusters, I.E. 2 or 3 different PIX firewalls running VRRPifconfig bridge0 createifconfig bridge0 addm em0 addm em1 addm em2 addm em3 addm em4 addm em5 up monitorsnort -i bridge0This way, snort works regardless of which firewall has failed over. The bridge is in monitor mode, so it's not actually trying to TX packets out the other interfaces, it just passes the packets it receives to BPF and returns. This is neat.

I did not want to preserve those changes.  I wanted to preserve all of the changes to files in /etc/, as those are important -- password files and the like.  I did not care about changes to files in /usr.  I preserved files in /var that related to logs.  I decided to make a new version with these contents.# cat base-modified.final /.cshrc/etc/group/etc/hosts/etc/manpath.config/etc/master.passwd/etc/motd/etc/passwd/etc/pwd.db/etc/shells/etc/spwd.db/etc/ttys/root/.cshrc/var/log/auth.log/var/log/cron/var/log/debug.log/var/log/lastlog/var/log/maillog/var/log/sendmail.st/var/log/wtmp/var/run/utmpIn step 14, Colin recommends recompiling all installed ports.

I will add back new packages when the upgrade process is finished.After following Colin's directions, I ended up with a system running FreeBSD 6.0 RELEASE.

CFIUS has the option to extend the review period for an additional 45-day review (or \"investigation\").That press release excerpt sounds fairly tame, but this CFIUS has 30 days in which to examine an acquisition. It can extend that period by 45 days for the purposes of investigation. This is exactly what has happened to Check Point. What's more, once the status of an examination becomes \"investigative\", the acquisition comes under the purview of none other than US President George W. Bush. At the end of the 45 days, CFIUS submits a report to the president, who must announce his decision within 15 days.All in all then, taking into account the initial 30 day period, the 45 day investigation period, and the 15 days for the presidential decision, it can take 90 days from the initial examination of the application until the president informs Congress whether he chooses to block the deal or not. For Check Point, only the first 30 days have gone by, so that, theoretically, closure of the deal could be put back to the second quarter...In the case of Check Point and Sourcefire, it is still not clear what the cause pf CFIUS's concern is. It is a fairly rare occurrence for it to choose to investigate such a low-value deal.Another friend pointed me to this Most foreign U.S. deals are approved after CFIUS completes an informal 30-day probe, but this transaction has raised the eyebrows of some of the panel members, leading to the lengthier examination.\"The fact that they launched a 45-day review means that some serious concerns are being raised,\" said a national security consultant who formerly worked at the Department of Defense.Sources said CFIUS representatives from the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security are worried that the deal gives critical computer network security technology to Israel. Sourcefire develops network security and information management systems for Defense Department agencies, in addition to private industry clients.I'll keep my eye on this.  I bet the deal will go through, with the government getting source code access to all Sourcefire products.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "This is part 3 of my RSA Conference 2006 wrap-up.  I started with . Before continuing I should mention a few items relating to my previous posts.  First, I forgot to say that I enjoyed presenting my talk on Tuesday afternoon.  Many attendees stayed to ask questions.  I ended up leaving the room about 45 minutes after my briefing ended.  Second,  asked me to mention his  on  and  through Third, in his talk Nitesh referenced his article , which includes a .  He also reminded the crowd of Foundstone's Now, on to new material.  I finished Wednesday's briefings by listening to , a fellow ex-intelligence professional.  I highly recommend that those of you who give me grief about \"threats\" and \"vulnerabilities\" listen to what Mr. Winkler has to say.  First, he distinguishes between those who perform security functions and those who perform counter-intelligence.  The two are not the same.  Security focuses on vulnerabilities, while counter-intelligence focus on threats.  He said if an asset does not expose a vulnerability, no threat can damage it.  If no threat exists, then a vulnerability cannot be exploited.  This sort of discussion is the reason we need to understand the difference between these two terms, which Mr. Winkler said are often \"confused.\"  Amen.Mr. Winkler presented the risk equation as the following: risk = asset value * (threat * vulnerabilities)/countermeasures.  I like that since it is essentially asset value * threat * vulnerabilities, with a denominator of countermeasures.  Since my version doesn't explicitly address countermeasures, I intend to add that in future references to the risk equation. Speaking of real threats, he gave a few examples.  I believe they are found in his books, but I am not sure.  I am repeating what he said, so I hope no one is offended by these remarks.  They simply represent some of what is happening in corporate America today.  Mr. Winkler described a Chinese restaurant located across the street from the research and development lab of a Fortune 5 company.  That company hires many people of Chinese descent.  He said that restaurant featured exceedingly good food, of better quality and cheaper price than might be found in China itself.  The restaurant is operated by the Chinese government, or associates of the Chinese government.  They staff the restaurant with operatives who try to befriend patrons from the R&D lab.  Guess why the restaurant is happy to host company luncheons where the R&D lab discusses upcoming projects?  Their meeting rooms are bugged.  Mr. Winkler said this sort of corporate espionage is nothing new, and that we all need to understand that this is the way the game is played.  He also said he knows people who have the job of \"drinking people under the table\" in order to get them to talk about their companies.Mr. Winkler advised that companies conduct security awareness training that emphasizes these points:A company's information has value.Competitors will try to steal it.Employees should report anything suspicious.Security staff should make employees aware of the countermeasures they deploy to mitigate risk.After talking about corporate espionage, Mr. Winkler explained how he and an accomplice were hired to steal plans to nuclear reactors from an American company.  He started the operation by visiting a nearby restaurant.  He searched through a bowl of business cards left by patrons at the front desk, and kept one from an employee of the company he was hired to penetrate.  Using that business card, he and his accomplice were able to acquire corporate badges from the target company.  They set themselves up as special assistants to the president of the company.They next traveled to the facility that was responsible for designing nuclear power plants.  He didn't even need his badge to enter the grounds, because the guard was waving everyone through the gate.  Mr. Winkler asked where he could find the graphics and printing department.  Why visit the engineering crew when you could get the same diagrams from the people who print them?  After spending half a day walking around asking the location of the team that printed the nuclear plant proposal, he found the right office.  The employees let Mr. Winkler sit at their computers, where he proceeded to acquire the IP address of the server hosting the plans.  He left and passed the information to his accomplice, who had set himself up in an empty office with intranet connectivity.  After downloading the target plans, the pair noticed unauthorized access to the server from computers in India.  As confirmed by , Mr. Winkler suspects the users of the Indian computers stole reactor plans and other sensitive data from the target company.I found Mr. Winkler's talk highly informative, blunt, and disturbing.  It was definitely worthwhile.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

This seemed to be a show by vendors, for vendors.  In some ways the presentations were afterthoughts, or just another way for some vendors to describe their products or upcoming technologies.  I plan to report on one or two cool products I encountered on the exposition floor, but for now I'll quickly mention the talks I saw.I began Tuesday be attending a briefing advertised as a discussion of wireless intrusion detection.  Instead of learning something new, I heard an IBM employee describe wireless as if the audience had never heard of it.  Buddy, it's 2006, for Pete's sake.  That was a wasted hour.Next I listened to Chris Wysopal discuss static binary analysis to discover security vulnerabilities.  In contrast to another ex-@Stake/ex-L0pht member (mentioned later), Chris was coherent, informative, and worth seeing.  He mentioned that compilers sometimes introduce vulnerabilities that were not intended by the coder.  This is called What You See Is Not What You eXecute, or Chris mentioned the  project, which I intend to visit.  He also discussed why he would like to see an .After Chris I saw Dan Geer speak.  That was certainly a valuable hour.  He postulated that \"data value and data mobility are conjoined,\" and that \"it's not security if it's not cost-effective.\"  Dr. Geer discussed relationships between predators and prey, and how they evolve together.  He focused on data \"as the point and focus of security,\" where the \"perimeter must contract down to data.\"  He believes data is at risk when it changes state, from when it goes from being at rest (in storage) to being in motion (in use).  Dr. Geer believes data must be protected at that point of transition.I was very pleased to hear and see these thoughts:  \"Monitoring is the first priority.  You cannot manage what you cannot measure.  The unknown unknowns will kill you.  Rumsfeld was right.\"  Attacks which do not reveal themselves require preemption.  Preemption requires intelligence.  Intelligence requires surveillance. But what should you observe, people or data?  Dr. Geer prefers observing data.  To perform that observation, he invoked the idea of a  (citing Anderson, circa-1972) that watches all data access, and can intervene when necessary.  It acts by analyzing \"traffic\" (ostensibly data manipulation, not packets) and does not use content inspection to make decisions.  Dr. Geer concluded by saying that trusted computing can be implemented in software or hardware.  Software implemention favors innovation with a default permit stance, while hardware favors safety and a default deny stance.  I obviously cannot do either of these talks justice, but if you'd like to hear more these talks should be sold through RSA in audio format.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

As nearly as I can tell from the course descriptions, the net benefit would be close to zero.\"[\"T]here's no generally applicable Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) upon which to base a Software Engineering examination, so (as I understand it) a Texas engineer seeking a PE license for software activities must demonstrate a suitable amount of experience, as attested by letters of recommendation.\"  (He was discussing efforts in Texas to make software engineers be PEs.)\"A 2001 ACM task force report on Licensing of Software Engineers Working on Safety-Critical Software concluded that professional licensing as it stands today simply wouldn't work in that field. They observe that very few 'software engineers' have an engineering degree accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, which all state PE licensing boards require. Most programmers, it seems, don't have the opportunity to forget Thermo and Chem, having not studied them in the first place.\"\"Software development also moves much faster than the \"If you produce work as a PE, you must follow established design practices or risk a malpractice lawsuit when your design fails. Software engineering, even in the embedded field, simply doesn't have any known-good design practices: Most projects fail despite applying the current crop of Best Practices.\"\"Worse, without a good self-imposed technical solution, we're definitely going to get legislative requirements that won't solve the problem.\"If you think that creating a test designed for \"software engineers\" is a good idea, check out the rest of the article to see Ed's experience taking the exams.  They sound like nothing more than a check to ensure the ability to answer a smattering of science and math questions.  The process reminded me of an exam we took at the Air Force Academy for what was then called (and may still be) Engineering 410.  This was supposed to be a \"capstone course\" that all seniors took to demonstrate their engineering prowess.  Yes, even your local history/political science double major took chemistry, physics (two courses), math (Cal III and Diff Eq), thermodynamics, and the five pure engineering courses (electrical, mechanical, civil, aeronautical, astronautical) prior to this capstone course.  (That's why I have Bachelor of Science degrees and not BAs.  At a normal college I would also have a minor in Engineering.)  To enter the capstone course, all students had to pass a cross-subject exam, where anything studied up to that point was fair game.  I should add that non-engineering subjects like biology or the \"soft sciences\" were also included.  If you failed the exam (with a possibility of one retake) you failed the course.  If you took the course in the fall semester, you could return in the spring.  If you took the course in the last semester of senior year (like me), and you failed the test, you were coming back for a special \"fifth year\" (USAFA has no real \"fifth year\" of study!) just to take Engineering 410.In the dreamworld of the academic faculty, I'm sure they believed this exam would test the quality of the \"engineers\" they were producing.  In reality all they tested was our ability to cram as much as we could fit into our brains prior to the test.  By the time I was a senior I had no clue what I had studied in chemistry or biology three years earlier.  After reading Ed's story, it sounds like his PE exams were exactly the same.  They test the candidate's ability to remember information (itself no mean feat, granted) and then apply that to a test.  They say nothing about whether the candidate is a good or even qualified engineer.If the test is worthless, what might really drive PEs to do good work?  I think the fact that PEs can lose their license to practice is a big factor.  That happened in the  I blogged about earlier.  If you're a PE and you lose your license because your project fails, you've lost your ability to make a living.  If you're a software developer and your project fails, you continue working or you get a job elsewhere.Incidentally, the skies over USAFA looked exactly like the photo posted above.  Every day.

Here's what happened.In 1915, United States Industrial Alcohol needed to build a tank in Boston to support World War I munitions production.  They decide to place it in an immigrant-dominated portion of the city; Italians live there.USIA puts Arthur Jell in charge.  He is a finance major with no technical or engineering experience or training.  He can't even read blueprints, yet he designs a five-story, 90' diameter tank capable of holding over 2 million gallons of molasses, in the middle of a populated area.The tank is built by contractors who use thin steel and too few rivets.  No one supervises their work.  They hurry to complete the tank 2 days before it is filled.Prior to being filled, the tank is \"tested\" by holding between 4 and 8 inches of water!The tank stands three years, although apparently it was never filled to capacity until shortly before its collapse.  During those three years, molasses leak from the tank on a daily basis.  Jell orders the leaks plugged and has the tank painted brown to divert attention from the leaks.In 1918, with WWI ending and prohibition approaching, USIA decides to switch production from industrial alcohol to drinking alcohol.  They want to cash out as fast as possible by supporting customers who want to \"stock up\" before prohibition begins.  They accept a shipment of molasses from Cuba in January 1919, which fills the tank to capacity.  Three days later, on January 15, the tank ruptures, killing 21 people and injuring 150.USIA claimed Italian anarchists had destroyed the tank, but the evidence showed otherwise.  USIA was subjected to the first ever class action lawsuit in the US, which the company lost.  Safety regulations were enacted which required supervision of construction, real testing, and stamps of approval of blueprints by architects and engineers.I foresee a similar event, with similar consequences, for the digital security industry.  Hopefully not as much death and destruction will occur, but the remedies will be the same.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Please see  for an introduction if you are reading this article separately.Next I heard  discuss problems with testing intrusion detection systems.  He said that researchers prefer objective means with absolute results, while users prefer subjective means with relative results.  This drives the \"false positive\" debate.  Researchers see false positives as failures of the IDS engine to work properly, while users see any problem as the fault of the whole system.Stefano mentioned work done by  and others on the Python-based  project that doesn't appear to have made much progress developing IDS testing methodologies.  Stefano said that good IDS tests must include background traffic; running an exploit on a quiet network is a waste of time.  Stefano is developing a test bed for network traffic generation in the context of testing IDS'.  He lamented there was no \"zoo list\" of attacks currently seen in the wild, as is the case with viruses and related malware.  Stefano claimed that vendors who say they perform \"zero day detection\" are really \"detecting new attacks against old vulnerabilities.\"  I don't necessarily agree with this, and I asked him about \"vulnerability filter\"-type rules.  He said those are a hybrid of misuse and anomaly detection.  Stefano declared that vendors who claim to perform \"anomaly detection\" are usually doing protocol anomaly detection, meaning they identify odd characteristics in protocols and not odd traffic in aggregate.  He reminded the audience of Bob Colwell's paper .  He also said that vendor claims must be backed up by repeatable testing methodologies.  Stefano made the point that a scientist could never publish a paper that offered unsubstantiated claims.I spoke with Stefano briefly and was happy to hear he uses my first After Stefano's talk I listened to  explain attacks on uninitialized local variables.  I admit I lost him about half way through his talk.  Here is what I can relate.  Non-initialized stack variables are regions on the stack that have not been initialized before being used. The trick is _not_ to insert code into these variables to be later executed, but to _control_ these values (as they might contain array indices or pointers). These can then be abused to gain control.  The problem revolves around the fact that the stack is not cleaned when items are popped off, for performance reasons.  Ok, that's about it. [Note: thanks to Halvar below for correcting this text!]Here are a few general thoughts on the talk.  Twice Halvar noted that finding 0-days is not as easy as it was before.  Bugs are getting harder to exploit.  In order to test new exploitation methods, Halvar can't simply find 20 0-days in an application and run his exploits against those vulnerabilities.  He also can't write simple yet flawed code snippets as test against those, since they do not adequately reflect the complexity of modern applications.  What he ends up doing is \"patching in\" flawed code into existing applications.  That way he ends up with a complex program with known problems, against which he can try novel exploitation methods.Halvar made heavy use of graphical depictions of code paths, as shown by his company's product , where many of the younger guns expressed their interest in graphical tools.  As the problem of understanding complex applications only grows, I see these graphical tools as being indispensible for seeing the bigger picture.For points of future research, Halvar wonder if there were uninitialized heap variables that could be exploited.  He said that complexity cuts two ways in exploit development.  Complex applications sometimes give intruders more freedom of manuever.  They also may exploitation more difficult because the order in which an application allocates memory often matters.  Halvar mentioned that Robert Graham, chief scientist of  (SCADA) systems.  SCADA systems control power, water, communication, and other utilities.  Robert does domestic and foreign penetration testing of SCADA systems, and he included a dozen case studies in his talk.  For example, he mentioned that the The broad outline of his conclusions include:Patches are basically forbidden on SCADA equipment.SCADA systems require little or no authentication.Little or not SCADA traffic is encrypted.Despite SCADA industry claims, SCADA systems are publicly accessible from the Internet, wireless networks, and dial-up.  The \"air gap\" is a myth.There is little to no logging of activity on the SCADA networks.In sum, Robert said that SCADA \"executives are living in a dreamworld.\"  They provide network diagrams with \"convenient ommissions\" of links between office and SCADA/production segments.  They are replacing legacy, dumb, RS-232 or 900 MHz-based devices with WinCE or Linux, Ethernet or 802.11-based devices.  Attackers can jump from the Internet, to the DMZ, to the office network, to the SCADA network.  They do not have to be \"geniuses\" to figure out how to operate SCADA equipment.  The manuals they need are either online or on the company's own open file servers.  SCADA protocols tend to be firewall-unfriendly, as they often need random ports to communicate.      SCADA protocols like the Inter Control Center Protocol (ICCP) or  (OPC, a DCOM-based Microsoft protocol) are brittle.  OPC, for example, relies on ASN.1.At the end of the talk Robert said there was no need to panic.  I asked \"Why?\" and so did .  Robert noted that SCADA industry threat models point to \"accidents, not determined adversaries.\"  That is a recipe for disaster.  The SCADA network reminds me of the Air Force in the early 1990s.  I will probably have more to say on that in a future article.I hope you enjoyed this conference wrap-up.

Thanks Sam.On Thursday I started with , who explained problems with analyzing adversarial code.  His main point was that tools currently used to investigate malware were built for programmers solving development problems, not secuirty people analyzing suspicious binaries.  He outlined three types of analysis problems.Some problems can be solved in polynomial time, meaning finding a solution is not difficult.Some problems can only be solved in nonpolynomial time, meaning that with infinite resources, they theoretically can be solved.Some problems, however, are undecidable.  There is no exact solution, regardless of resources.  Approximation is the best answer.Dr. Lakhotia said disassembly is an undecidable problem.  He described a few examples to make his point.He also noted that although there are huge numbers of distinct pieces of malware (12,000 in the last ), there are really a very small number of malware families.  In other words, code reuse and plagarism is rampant in the malware world.  Using this fact, Dr. Lakhotia demonstrated novel ways to decipher call obfuscation and reverse malware to a single \"common form.\"  Keep an eye on his Web site for a place where malware will be categorized according to families in a system called \"VILO\".  I also learned of , a malware collection site.  I guess  is similar.Next I heard my friend Kevin Mandia talk about recent incident response and computer forensics cases he and his team have worked.  He stated that while investigating 215 suspected compromised systems in the last three years, he could only conclusively say 103 were 0wned.  Of those, only 32 revealed enough evidence to demonstrate the intruder's point of entry.  Why?  The team seldom had the time, audit records, or network logs to figure out what had happened.Kevin said that modern incident response in corporate America is characterized by \"vague reporting channels\" and \"processes that are shelf-ware.\"  Companies approach IR as a \"directionless infantry march\" instead of a \"precision blitzkrieg.\"  Kevin then outlined common indicators of compromise.The number one detection method is internal end users.  When their systems crash, their anti-virus refuses to start, they cannot \"save as\" documents, install new applications, run common applications, or start Task Manager, they are likely compromised.Surge in bandwidth usageAnti-virus hits: these do not mean the problem has been dealt with.  Rather, it's the tip of the iceberg.IDS detection is rare, but can be effective during the IR.Customers are often a helpful source of detection indicators.Kevin recommends enabling process tracking, to which I would add exporting the resulting logs via syslog to a central reporting server farm.  He shared a few tips for understanding system processes, like using \"tasklist /svc\" on Windows XP and \"psservice -a\" to see what processes are started by the Windows svchost.exe, a sort of \"inetd\" for Windows.Kevin's team demonstrated their new First Response client-server architecture for Windows.  You will see me describe this as soon as I can try the beta.  Suffice it to say that this free program will rock the IR world.  It makes retrieving and analyzing live response data a snap.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Please see  for an introduction if you are reading this article separately.Staying on the rootkit theme, I next heard  discuss \"Rootkit Hunting vs. Compromise Detection.\" She has done some impressive work on network-based covert channels, but she is also a rootkit guru.  Joanna talked about \"Explicit Compromise Detection,\" and the need to scan kernel memory for integrity checking.  She challenged many of the ideas of traditional rootkits, such as the need to survive a reboot, the desire to hide processes, open sockets, and so on.  It seems like her new DeepDoor rootkit is an all-in-one package that hooks the  (NDIS) code by modifying four words in the NDIS data section of memory.  She demonstrated her ddcli client talking to a DeepDoor'd victim.  The client communicated with the server over port 445 TCP.  Fair enough, but port 445 TCP was also able to handle normal SMB traffic, even with the rootkit active!  That is insane.  She showed how her rootkit could still function even with Zone Alarm denying access.  Joanna emphasized that there is no safe way to read kernel memory on Windows.  She said that even reading physical memory can be tough.  She requested that Microsoft implement a means to let third party vendors reliably read kernel memory.  She said that such a new feature would not aid attackers, since they do not care if their unreliable methods end up crashing a target.  A security vendor, however, must take extra care.  Joanna noted that next generations operating systems should ship with more than two CPU privilege modes, and that Trusted Computing will not prevent the attacks she described.  She mentioned the introduction of a hypervisor that runs at ring -1 (todays systems descend to ring 0).  Joanna also postulated that there may be a finite number of places for malware to hook an OS, so perhaps it would be helpful to enumerate them in a public place. A related project is her .  Joanna was not able to release her DeepDoor rootkit for reasons of \"NDAs.\"  She was also not able to discuss ongoing work on network covert channels for the same reason.  On a personal note, I spoke with  (note he has cut his hair WAY back from what's shown in the photo!) who had a tough time pronouncing my name.  I guessed that as a fellow Eastern European (I'm American but my ancestors are from that area), Joanna (who is Polish) would be able to pronounce \"bate-lik.\"  Joanna was sitting nearby, and sure enough, she could!After hearing about rootkits for three straight talks, I took a break by hearing  discuss new directions for disk forensics.  (He reminded the audience of his company , and I learned by speaking with him that he sells a laptop version of Simson spoke for a long time discussing his ongoing .  He introduced his cross-drive forensic analysis methodology, which involves finding interesting data on groups of hard drives.  One of the most powerful techniques was building histograms of email addresses.  On a single hard drive, the most frequently seen email address is usually the address of the hard drive owner.  He also searched hard drives for patterns associated with credit cards.  The interesting aspect of this sort of analysis is that he is reviewing raw data in all cases, such that he can even review something like an Oracle data drive that has no conventional partitions.I was most excited to hear about Simson's  project.  He noted that images produced by dd are big and contain no metadata.  Proprietary formats like the .  AFF contains tools that do more than efficiently image and describe drives.  They acquisition tools can even help bring old drives to life by pulsing and otherwise manipulating them.  The most thought-provoking aspect of Simson's presentation was his discussion of the market for used hard drives on eBay.  He says people pay unreasonable amounts for small old hard drives, and defintely odd amounts for hard drives reported as broken.  The implication is that those hard drives might be bought by criminals hunting for sensitive information.  (Simson gave examples of such data during his presentation.)  He is working to educate people that \"format\" does not mean \"erase,\" and he hopes Microsoft will replace the current format command with a tool that truly zeroes out a drive.  Simson also said he is unaware of any technique to retrieve data from a zeroed-out hard drive, saying that 's 1996 techniques would no longer work on drives built since then due to the density of modern drives.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Please see  for an introduction if you are reading this article separately.The first technical talk I attended was presented by , titled \"Finding Digital Evidence In Physical Memory.\"  Mariusz really needed two hours or more to give his topic justice.  He started his talk buy holding up DoD and DoJ manuals which recommend  as an incident response step (argh), and he said commercial tools all focus on inspecting hard drives.  Unfortunately, modern rootkits may stay in non-swappable memory pages, and will not touch the hard drive.  Therefore, traditional victim hard drive forensic practices may be useless against modern techniques.Mariusz named three anti-forensic methods.Data contraception: do not create data on the hard drive; keep everything in memoryData hiding: keep processes from appearing in task or process listsData destruction: remove suspicious information on the file systemHe mentioned a few cool examples.The Core Security syscall proxy as a means to not write any files to disk when loading malicious programs into memory on a target system. The  dumps Windows password hashes from a Meterpreter shell without writing any files to disk. has commercial antidetection modules. Jamie Butler's  (collaboration with Sherri Sparks) are impressive.Marius briefly discussed software- and hardware-based means to acquire victim memory.  On the hardware side he noted  via The most relevant aspect of Mariusz's talk was his announcement of two tools for reviewing physical memory dumps.  The first is the Windows Memory Forensic Toolkit (WMFT) and the second is Idetect, for Linux.  These look very interesting, and I believe Mariusz will release new versions once he returns to Poland.  Mariusz' talk and several that followed emphasized that memory absolutely must be analyzed when performing incident response.Next I saw John Heasman from  present \"Implementing and Detecting an ACPI BIOS Rootkit.\"  John was the best speaker at BH Federal, in terms of content and delivery style.  His  can be used to read and write sensitive areas of targets, like system memory.  For example, ACPI could be used to  on a Windows system by extracting ACPI Machine Language (AML) from a target BIOS, finding inititialization control methods, appending ACPI Source Language (ASL) to implement the SeAccessCheck exploit, recompiling into machine language, flashing the BIOS, and rebooting the system.  Linux has a similar problem where the sys_ni_syscall exception handler could be patched.  John brought up very interesting points about rootkits.  He asked whether they always need to be active, or if they could simply activate at random times to frustrate detection.  He said the bootable CDs that use ACPI would be as vulnerable as the OS installed on a hard drive, making life tougher for incident responders.  Sure, ACPI can be disabled, but that may disable some device drivers too.  John said that ACPI debugging and Windows event logs may yield clues to ACPI exploitation, so stay alert.  He also mentioned that ACPI could be modified such that fans never activate.  Combine that with a process that starts the CPUs spinning and you have a software-based way to destroy a machine!Keep in mind that a BIOS rootkit would not be a traditional rootkit.  It would be used to infect a target, and then code on the target would open back doors and so on.  The BIOS only offers \"tens of KB\" of space, according to John.This reinforces my point that .  Now all we need is a Cisco router or switch rootkit.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

He briefly discussed the , which will be delivered to Congress on 6 Feb.  He lamented the fact that the DoD budgets in 6 year increments, beyond which the department has to look 10 more years.  He asked the audience to consider what the world was like in 1990 compared to today.  How could planners in a pre-Gulf War, Soviet-facing, Internet-minimal world anticipate the current landscape?  He mentioned that the , \"Military Support for Stability, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction (SSTR) Operations,\" dated November 28, 2005, emphasizes the traditional non-combat activities like network defense are on par with combat operations.  With regards to threats facing DoD, Dr. Wells said the threat is the \"patient, skilled, well-resourced adversary with intent to do harm.\"  (Dr. Wells did not say a hole in OpenSSH is a threat!)

The first group includes anyone who wants to get the most out of the unique techniques and tools found in Debian.

        "content": "Last night I attended my local  (DIAP).  He is a \"Change and Workforce Management Senior Managing Consultant\" with IBM working on implementing , \"Information Assurance Training, Certification, and Workforce Management\", which I I will try to summarize what I heard, with the expectation that Mr. Busch's slides will be posted at the ISSA-NoVA Web site soon.  I managed to get related material from this earlier The vision for 8570.1 is the following:A professional, efficiently managed IA workforce with knowledge and skills to securely configure information technology, effectively employ tools, techniques and strategies to defeat adversaries, and proactively identify and mitigate the full spectrum of rapidly evolving threats and vulnerabilities in order to protect the network.After reading my comments, you may agree that the implementation of 8570.1 will not meet this vision.8570.1 will apply to anyone with privileged access (e.g., system administration) to DoD systems, to include uniformed military personnel, civilians, and contractors.  The following chart summarizes 8570.1 (incorrectly called \"8570\" below) and 8570.1-M, the Manual which was signed on 19 December 2005 and provides implementation guidance.Essentially, to administer a DoD system, military, civilian, and contractor operators will have to attain these goals:Vendor-neutral security certificationVendor-specific platform certificationOn-the-job trainingBefore I discuss the approved certifications, let's look at the people affected by these requirements.  The slide shows two existing tracks.  One is an IA Technical Category (for system and network administrators) and the other is an IA Management Category.  Now let's see the certification list as displayed last night.The Tech I and Management I categories are the bottom of the pyramids shown previously, while the IIIs are the top of the pyramids.Let's break out those acronyms, since I didn't recognize all of them.  First, the certifications for technical people:) Certified Security Associate; never encountered this before; never even heard of them certified.  All of these certifications need to be ISO compliant, but I do not think they all presently are compliant. (ISACA); also five people.  It is absolutely ridiculous to put the tech-less CISSP in the same category as the GSE, which requires \"five intermediate level GIAC certifications\" and \"3 days of testing!\"Here are the certifications for managers, only listing those not covered above:The list will not necessarily be used by everyone in DoD.  The DoD components can choose the certs on this list that they will accept.  They cannot independently add certs to the list, although the oversight board managing this program for DoD can add new certs in the future.You are probably wondering about the vendor-specific certification requirements.  Mr. Busch explained that if a person administers Microsoft systems, they will need Microsoft certification.  If they are a Cisco network admin, they will need Cisco certification.  He admitted they have \"not done much\" yet in this area.Earlier I reported on this [DoD] requires frontline security professionals to have certifications from CompTIA and (ISC)2 but not from the SANS Institute or vendors.That is patently not true.  When I first read that statement, I thought I understood why Alan Paller was upset.  Now that I see there are some SANS certifications accepted by DoD, I realize he is more upset by DoD's choice of certifications.  I agree with him.Essentially, if you have your CISSP, you have the \"golden ticket\" for technical or managerial work in DoD.  While that might be appropriate for management, it is absolutely worthless for operators.  This DoD program is not going to result in any better security if the emphasis is placed on certs that have little or no technical relevance.  There may be benefit to having vendor-specific certs.  Someone responsible for administering Solaris, Red Hat, or Cisco products are probably going to benefit from those programs.  Unfortunately, DoD seems to be treating these programs as an afterthought.One audience member asked Mr. Busch what he should tell an admin he knows that works on Oracle, Microsoft SQL, Solaris, and slew of other applications and operating systems.  Mr. Busch replied \"Most DoD components don't have that many OS' in one environment.\"  This will be a real shock to the people on the front lines!DoD plans to collect \"IA performance data\" to \"measure the effectiveness\" of this program.  I would like to see if the people they consider \"certified\" (and they want 10% of the force ready by 30 Dec 06) are any more capable than the uncertified crowd.I also wonder why DoD didn't leverage the  (CSIH) certification program.  It's practically DoD already, is vendor-neutral, has been around for a long time, and appears to cover the subjects I would want to see in DoD security people.There are some aspects of this program that I think are beneficial, without reservations.  Mr. Busch said DoD is trying to include IA training within Professional Military Education, such as that found at the war colleges.  This is a great idea and I would be interested in helping with that program.  People with IA certifications will also be tracked DoD-wide, and IA will be treated less as an \"additional duty\" and more of a professional obligation.  Crucially, Mr. Busch recognizes that receiving training helps retention.  Someone during the ISSA meeting asked what DoD will do when it trains its people and then watches them separate from the service.  That attitude absolutely infuriates me.  The alternative means keeping untrained people in place, because they have no marketable skills?  That is completely idiotic.  I argued with a colonel at the Pentagon about this when I was a captain.  I would like to hear your thoughts on this program.  Overall, I think the intentions are good, but the selection of certs is on the whole misguided.  I also hope to hear more details from Alan Paller, who seems to have a good grasp on this issue.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Last week I read several magazines on the way to DoD Cybercrime.  Here are a few thoughts on what I read.  From the threat and vulnerability definition department, we have the article  from :The Homeland Security Department has made $765 million available in fiscal 2006 for 35 urban areas to guard against terrorist threats, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff announced today.The Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) this year follows a new, risk-based formula that allots funding according to threat, vulnerability and consequence, Chertoff said...In assigning the grants, DHS also for the first time used threat analysis from the intelligence community to look at different kinds of threats, such as transient populations, Chertoff said.Replace the word \"consequence\" with \"cost of replacement\" in the second paragraph and you have the common risk equation found in my books and elsewhere.  Nice reporting, Michael Arnone!I liked this People talk a lot about the new skills for IT being \"business\" skills, coming from the business side. It bothers me that people talk about \"the business\" as if it\u2019s some monolithic thing made up of every department that\u2019s not IT. The implication is that all these not-IT departments share common skills, attributes and concerns, and that there are no competing interests among them or any lack of understanding between them. It also seems to assume that they possess some intrinsic understanding of what\u2019s right for the enterprise\u2019s future and that IT doesn\u2019t. Right.Frankly, I don\u2019t think \"the business,\" or any one part of it, is in unique possession of the skills necessary to construct the 21st-century organization. In fact, I\u2019d hazard to say that IT may be better equipped to drive and execute this transformation than any other department in the modern corporation.Thank you.  I don't know what you read or hear, but I am tired of hearing drivel about \"business skills.\"  Here's an example from the same issue of CIO, an article titled :The preferred educational background for IT employees today is more often an MBA than a computer science degree, says [Lauri] Orlov [VP and research director for Forrester]. New IT hires are as likely to be brought over from the business side as they are to have been groomed in IT.Is this why companies continue to be compromised?  Are the MBAs running around wondering why their self-defending networks are failing?  I guarantee we will see a \"back-to-basics\" movement in the next few years, where \"hands-on\" tech skills will be emphasized again.Speaking of \"hands-on\" skills, FCW had another interesting article -- .  So what's the big deal?  Alan Paller summarizes the findings:Many popular information technology security certifications don't improve holders' ability to ensure computer systems' security, according to a new survey from the SANS Institute, a training and education organization for security professionals.The survey found that respondents with certifications from the  (CompTIA), the  -- also known as (ISC)2 -- and the  (ISACA) think that their training does not give them as strong an advantage in performing hands-on security jobs as platform- and vendor-specific certifications do.Because respondents could vote for multiple certifications, \"the low votes for CompTIA, (ISC)2 and ISACA certifications are compelling proof that these certifications should not be relied upon for people with hands-on security responsibilities,\" said Alan Paller, the institute's director of research.One could argue this report and the Why is Alan upset?He is especially concerned that the Defense Department now requires its frontline information assurance employees to have such nontechnical certifications. DOD's decision, finalized in December, came after the Titan Rain scandal last year in which international cybercriminals circumvented DOD's security measures and stole classified information.\"If these certifications do not correlate with hands-on security skills, then DOD is misleading its commanders by implying their people have the necessary security skills when they do not,\" Paller said.What does DoD require?DOD officials are satisfied with their choice of certifications, said Robert Lentz, director of information assurance in the DOD CIO's office. The department has codified competencies for its IT security employees under , \"Information Assurance Training, Certification and Workforce Management,\" which requires frontline security professionals to have certifications from CompTIA and (ISC)2 but not from the SANS Institute or vendors.Lentz said the certifications ensure that information assurance employees have adequate hands-on experience. Combined with additional specialized training that commanders provide on-site, they will ensure sufficient security for mission-critical systems, he added.CompTIA and (ISC)2?  Wonderful.  Even I will admit that SANS certification holders are far more technically equipped than  or It is a tragedy that the CISSP has become associated with \"hands-on\" technical proficiency.  And what of CompTIA?The CompTIA Security+ certification tests for security knowledge mastery of an individual with two years on-the-job networking experience, with emphasis on security.\"Two years\" and \"security knowledge mastery\" should not be in the same sentence.I may have more to say on this topic after I attend tonight's Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

If the patch breaks something, they fix it.  The bank no longer cares about Mean Time To Failure.  All they track is Mean Time to Repair.  Dr. Geer said this approach is not unusual and it is more common than you might think.Dr. Geer warned that \"we are in danger of being overtaken by people with credentials and process instead of skill and knowledge.\"  This sounds like a warning against auditors and non-technical people.One sixth of security vulnerabilities are found by the owners of the flawed software.  That means five sixths are found by others.Dr. Geer uses a disease model for computer security.  He said we don't need every system to be patched, only \"enough.\"  This is called \"herd immunity.\"  Enough members of the community are immune to keep the disease from destroying the group.After Dr. Geer's talk I listened to Joe Stewart of A sandnet is unique because it is a structured, semi-automated way to use real machines for malware analysis.  Too much malware that Joe researches is Next I watched ) describe .  Essentially he has implemented a means to mirror Web sites in a manner that simulates a human user rather than a simple retrieval of all Web site pages.  In some ways his work appeared to be a \"solution in search of a problem,\" because he assumes Web site administrators pay attention to their logs and check who is mirroring or otherwise investigating their sites.  On the other hand, I know his work will be of great interest to many parties who want to add another layer of discretion to their Web site surveillance activities.  After acidus I saw 's latest \"Black Ops of TCP/IP\" presentation.  I think I first saw Dan speak , and he always delivers.  His latest research demonstrates a way to abuse IP fragment reassembly timers to fool IDS/IPS.  He explained that highly complex inline devices are easy to fingerprint, since each device accepts or rejects traffic differently -- especially at layer 7.  Dan also presented updated data on his adventures investigating Sony, and introduced Xovi, his streaming graph visualization framework.  Dan said you can feed Xovi Tcpdump data, which I would love to try.  I started Saturday by arriving late for 's keynote.  (Hey, I live about an hour away, I need to find parking, etc.)  Thankfully she ran about 20 minutes over her allotted time, so I probably listened to her for 50 minutes or so.  She spent a good deal of time talking about the implications of the Bush administration's domestic spying program.  With privacy in mind, I then turned to a talk on improvements in After hearing about Tor I attended a fascinating talk about I turned back to computer security issues by attending a BoF on reverse engineering hosted by  and Chris Eagle (author of  ().  Steve Micallef's  was brought up, as was rom.by (warning: Russian).  I managed to see most of 's presentation on single packet authorization (SPA), which was cool.  I was nervous because I was speaking next, so it was tough to concentrate.  After my talk I participated in a Snort BoF held by  and .  They made good points on high-performance Snort operation, including using an architecture-specific compiler to get better performance.  In other words, avoid GCC and use an  on Intel, an  on AMD, and so on.  Brian mentioned  as a means for faster packet collection, along with Four aspects of ShmooCon stand out.The Shmoo Group threw tons of manpower at this conference.  I saw red shirts everywhere.  This was welcome and unlike any other conference I've attended.The quality of the talks was very good.  They were not all stellar, but the value for the money is absolutely unparalleled.I have not spoken with so many recognized speakers, authors, and researchers anywhere else.  I personally shared at least a few words with Eric Cole, Jenifer Granick, Greg Hoglund, Brian Krebs, Dan Langille, Dru Lavigne, Ike Levy, Johnny Long, Mike Poor, Mike Rash, George Rosamond, Marcus Sachs, Ed Skoudis, and Visigoth.  Several Sguil users were there, including #snort-gui regulars like Hanashi (with whom I presented), nr, snortboy, and transzorp.  Many people were kind enough to say hello, and one even gave me a coin from his three letter .gov agency.Many of the talks are available for sale in DVD format from .  I am sure their Web site will be updated to reflect ShmooCon soon, but I already see my talk in their Kudos to the Shmoo Group and founder Bruce Potter.If you didn't attend ShmooCon last year, please consider it for 2007.

        "content": "I attended two conferences last week.  The first was the  in Palm Harbor, FL.  I spoke there in 2000 while still a captain at the AFCERT, and in 2005 as a civilian.  This year I delivered presentations on  and .I started the conference on Tuesday afternoon by listening to Alan Paller from SANS.  His talk included a \"hacking demo\" showing a firewall compromised by an IMAP vulnerability, followed by a Red Hat 4.2 box allowing a direct root login with no password, thanks to an unspecified exploit.  He also displayed a screen shots of rootshell.com, warforge.com, and NetBus 1.6.  What do all of those items have in common?  How about the fact that they all went out of style prior to 2000?In reality, I'm not sure which of the following worries me more:Seeing Alan present a demo where an OS from 1997 is 0wn3d.Seeing law enforcement, military, and government audience members taking notes as if something new was being described.Apart from his demo, I thought Alan made a few interesting remarks, like the following:\"A firewall is a steel door on a cardboard house.\"  That is an interesting twist on the old \"crunchy perimeter\" cliche.\"The national cyber defense strategy of the United States it to blame the user.\"  Alan then asked \"Which user -- the grandmother or the eight-year-old?\"  Good point.  \"Network owners, ISPs, system and software vendors are the only ones who can make cyberspace significantly safer for all of us.\"  Alan also blames system integrators who deliver \"solutions\" to agencies.I had a chance to ask Alan why he praises the , while never mentioning the .  Alan was kind enough to call me \"one of the good guys,\" and to say that thin clients are an option that should be explored.After hearing Alan speak I wandered around until I met a few friends from my AFCERT days.  Next I attended 's expose of hacking as portrayed in the movies.  Parts of it were hilarious.  He put  a ton of work into that presentation.  I next saw the screenwriter of the movie \"Enemy of the State\" talk about how to portray villains on screen.  After an uncomfortably long video clip showing Hitler rant about \"one People, one Reich, one Fuehrer,\" I decided to leave the talk early to visit some friends in St. Petersburg.I started Wednesday by presenting my own material at 0930.  I wanted to see Kerry Long from the  discuss a project called Interrogator, but I missed it.  Thankfully Kerry tracked me down and even sat through my second presentation.  During lunch he described his talk.  Interrogator is a means to filter, collect, compress, and centrally store network traffic.  The problem his project addresses is one I hadn't considered before.  Let's say you are a network security vendor.  If you want the military to test your product, you probably want them to deploy your gear on a production network.  That is usually your only deployment model.  The military does not want to put your device on the network.  They would rather test it in a lab.  However, lab traffic usually doesn't match production traffic very well.  Interrogator allows Kerry to pull large quantities of traffic to a central, trusted location (his lab), where it can be replayed on an isolated network.  A security device in the lab can then inspect the traffic.  After lunch I gave a second talk, and then I listened to Jennifer Christianson discuss tips and tricks for host-based forensics.  She basically reminded me that anybody can talk the talk of doing forensics (or any other technical job), but you have to do it on a daily basis to really know what you are doing.  It's been a while since I had to do any host-based forensics, so I was reminded of the importance of regular hands-on problem-solving tasks.The next talk absolutely justified me paying my way to the conference and not leaving immediately after my talks.  I listened to  from  in Brooklyn, NY describe ForNet summarizes network traffic it observes on the wire.  Dr. Memon described summarizing 1-2 TB of network traffic down to 20 GB.  He uses a system of hashing and statistical probabilities involving Bloom Filters to describe the traffic.  This does not mean one can inspect that 20 GB of traffic and see original packets.  Rather, one can query ForNet and ask \"have you ever seen traffic that looks like this?\"  \"This\" could be the payload of a worm, part of an email, a movie, and so on.  Beyond summarizing traffic, ForNet tracks a variety of characteristics about what it sees.  It collects a form of extended session data called NeoFlow that includes a judgment about the type of data seen.  For example, if ForNet samples traffic from a stream it can identify it as being encrypted, or text, or audio, or video, and so on.  One could then query for \"all audio sessions\" and find people trading music.  The ForNet team has used this function to query for forms of data that should not be expected from certain systems.  If a server should not communicate with encryption, but it does, perhaps it is compromised.This is an amazing achievement.  I suggest reading the papers on the ForNet Web site.  You may also find this I found Interrogator and ForNet to be exciting ways to focus network security monitoring on application-level data, in an age where bandwidth is always an issue.  Products like  work by collecting vast amounts of traffic in raw form, but they tend to be expensive.  These projects also reminded me to watch the  (NTAR) project for developments.I ended Wednesday by participating in a book signing.  I sat for an hour, signed one book, and gave copies of my three books away to a few stalwart visitors.On Thursday I started the day learning of the hoops that legal folk have to jump through to get data from ISPs and online companies like Yahoo!.  I then listened to Michael Davis from the  talk about IPv6.  The IPv6 talk reminded me to ask this question: who reading this blog has a native IPv6 connection?  In other words, you're not talking IPv6 through a tunnel.  If you have such a connection, would anyone be willing to give me a shell account on a box with native IPv6 connectivity?  I could figure out how to use a tunnel service to escape my IPv4 Comcast connection and connect to the shell account.  I am looking for a place to learn more about IPv6.After the IPv6 presentation I heard researchers from Lucent describe their \"RouterShield,\" which was unfortunately more boring than I expected.  The pair did make a good point when they said too much or too little traffic from a host can be suspicious.  I also heard news of a project at the  called Nemean that  for creating Snort signatures.'s talk was very good.  She outlined ways to gather information on people using the Internet and pay-for-use databases.  She also explained six steps to take to reduce one's public profile.  She said we will have to begin using the techniques pioneered by \"celebrities and fraud artists\" if we wish to protect our identities.I ended the say seeing Kevin Mandia discuss malware analysis.  He said a recent foresnics case involved 54 binaries, of which 29 were non-public, 44 were not detected by anti-virus, and 10 were packed by four different methods.  He reported another case where the intruder overwrote IIS Web logs.  Kevin described cases where  revealed indicators of many compromised systems.  Kevin also said he's used dd to duplicate hard drives of live machines, which he then analyzed using EnCase.  He mentioned a tool called Before I left for the airport I got a chance to discuss future directions for Kevin's company.  I recommend keeping an eye on 's Web site, especially in mid-February, for some exciting changes.Overall I thought DoD Cybercrime was a great conference.  I hope to speak next year.

These classes are in the planning phase now, but I will be more confident of advancing their progress if I receive positive feedback.The first class is TCP/IP Weapons School.  I plan at least four days of material.  The idea behind TCP/IP Weapons School is to teach TCP/IP packet analysis, with a twist -- all traffic will be generated by network security reconnaissance, exploitation, and communications tools.  (The name is related to the .)  This course is for attendees closer to the beginning of their network security career.  It will be a cool way to learn TCP/IP, without the boring aspects of a typical \"fundamentals\" class.  I plan to cover the most popular protocols seen when performing network security monitoring, intrusion detection, and network forensics.  As a class participant, you'll learn how to interpret network traffic -- but also understand how security tools look when seen on the wire.  I will probably teach this course solo, and I hope to introduce at least part of it at  and potentially .The second class is Network Stealth.  I plan at least two days of material.  The idea behind Network Stealth is to teach how to evade network access control and detection systems.  This course is for attendees with intermediate knowledge of packet analysis, such as TCP/IP Weapons School graduates.  The core of the class will be network-based; there may be some host-level issues if people find that interesting.  I plan to cover evasion and insertion attacks, a wide variety of covert channels, timing and volume attacks, and related ways to make life tough for security analysts.  As a class participant, you'll learn how attackers can bypass your IDS, IPS, firewall, and other security measures so you can better deal with those events.  I am currently brainstorming with a very skilled security analyst who I expect to teach the course with me.  I hope to introduce this course at .So what do you think?

Apparently the original issue involved the 10 Mbps hub not handling traffic from the single interface of the port aggregator tap, which must have operated at 100 Mbps and failed to autonegotiate to 10 Mbps properly.We also previously explained why the next setup is a terrible idea:In a very helpful comment to the last post, Joshua suggested the following setup:This arrangement takes the output of a traditional two output tap and sends each output to a separate 100 Mbps hub.  Sensors can then connect one output from each of their two sniffing interfaces to each hub.  The sensor must take care of bonding the traffic on its two interfaces.  This arranagement is novel because it allows more than one sensor to receive tap output.  In the situation depicted, up to seven sensors could receive tap output.So what is the bottom line?  It remains true that hubs can never be used to combine the outputs of a traditional two output tap into a \"single interface\".  However, it is possible to use them in the arrangements depicted in this post.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Every time I attend a  issue features some great stories, with some of them available right now to non-USENIX members.  (USENIX makes all magazine articles open to the public one year after publication.  For example, anyone can now read the entire  issue.)An article which caught my eye was Forensics for System Administrators by .  Although the USENIX copy of the article won't be published until August 2006, you can read Sean's copy I thought the article was proceeding well until I came across this advice.\"What happens when there is some past event that a system administrator wishes to understand on their system?  Where should the administrator, now a novice forensic analyst, begin? There are many variables and questions that must be answered to make proper decisions about this. Under almost all circumstances in which the system can be taken down to do the analysis, the ideal thing to do is halt or power-off the system using a hardware method.\"  (emphasis added)Is he serious?  The article continues:\"[T]he x86 BIOS does not have a monitor mode that supports this [a hardware interrupt]. The solution for everyone else? Pull the plug. The machine will power off, the disk will remain as-is, and there will be no possibility of further contamination of the evidence through some sort of clean-up script left by the intruder, as long as the disk is not booted off or mounted in read/write mode again. The reason for stopping a machine is that it prevents further alteration of the evidence. The reason for halting with a hardware interrupt, rather than using the UNIX halt or shutdown command is that if a root compromise occurred, those commands could have been trojaned by an intruder to clean up evidence.\"I can't believe I'm reading this advice in 2005, only 6 days from 2006.  This is the advice I heard nearly 10 years ago.  \"Pulling the plug\" as the first step in a forensic investigation is absolutely terrible advice.  I am not a host-based forensics guru, but I know that a live response, first described in the June 2001 book  by Mandia, Prosise, and Pepe, should be part of even the most basic forensically-minded sys admin's techniques.  Sean could have even looked into the ;login: archives to find Keith Jones' article in the  issue describing live response.  Live response is a technique to retrieve volatile information from a running system in a forensically sound manner.  Live response can be frustrated by some binary and kernel alteration techniques, but it is a good (non-network-centric) first step whenever a host is suspected of being compromised.  Those who want to know more about live response, and see how helpful the advice can be, will enjoy reading .  Sean tries to defend pulling the plug here:\"In our first example intrusion, I took a preliminary look at the syslog and saw that dates of suspicious logins went back at least three weeks. Given that the intrusion seemed to be going on for so long, I decided that I could no longer trust the system to reliably and accurately report evidence about itself. Therefore, pulling the plug on the machine was the best option.\"That is a really weak excuse.  Certainly a non-ankle-biter attacker will take steps to hide his presence.  That does not mean that no attempt should be made to collect volatile system information!Sean continues:\"It is certainly the case that halting a system can help perserve more evidence, particularly that in swap, slack, or otherwise unallocated space on disk. But it also can destroy some evidence. For example, halting a system will wipe out the contents of memory, hindering the ability of an analyst to dump a memory image to disk. However, in the forensic discussions in this article, slack space and memory dumps are outside the scope of our analysis. In our case, halting a system merely helped to preserve real evidence, and had the intrusion in our first example been discovered sooner, and the system sooner halted as a result, the intruder would have had less time to cover their tracks. Then, as I will discuss, certain helpful log files that were deleted may have been recoverable.\"If Sean is worried that an intruder will take actions to \"cover their tracks,\" then the live response can be performed after the victim host has been cut off from the Internet.  Sure, the most 31337 attackers may detect this and start self-cleansing procedures, but how often does that happen?  Also, collecting live response data does not usually trigger any cleaning mechanisms.  The sort of data one collects is the normal information a system administrator might inspect during the course of regular duties.The fundamental issue here is whether pulling the plug should be the first response activity or not.  In my experience, cutting off remote access is the first step.  Analysis of NSM data involving the target host is second.  Live response is the third.  Forensic duplication and analysis is the fourth, if the previous two steps point to compromise and the resources for investigation and available.  This part of the article makes me sad:\"This material is based on work sponsored by the United States Air Force and supported by the Air Force Research Laboratory under Contract F30602-03-C-0075 and performed in conjunction with Lockheed Martin Information Assurance. Thanks to Sid Karin, Abe Singer, Matt Bishop, and Keith Marzullo, who provided valuable discussions during the writing of this article.\"First, why is the Air Force paying for advice that should have been abandoned in 1998, the last time I remember the Air Force suggesting these sorts of actions?  Second, why didn't any of the article reviewers speak out against this bad advice?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

According to this Cisco AON is currently available in two products that integrate into Cisco switches and routers:Cisco Catalyst\u00ae 6500 Series AON module, which is primarily deployed in enterprise core or data centersCisco 2600/2800/3700/3800 series AON module, which is primarily deployed at branch officesAON is part of Cisco's  project.  From the article:\"The Cisco AON module in the branch puts intelligent decision-making at the network edge. It can intercept and analyze traffic in various message formats and protocols and bridge between them, provide security, and validate messages, creating a transparent interface between trading partners and, in effect, a good business-to-business gateway. It can manage remote devices that send messages to the Cisco Integrated Services Router in the branch. It can also filter messages from multiple sources that come into the branch router for duplicates or by other criteria, aggregate them, make decisions according to instructions, and transmit selected messages to a sister AON module deployed in the data center.\" (emphasis added)I find this aspect very interesting.  It sounds like AON could be used to enforce protocol and security policies.  I wonder if this might eventually happen on a per-port basis?  Security on a per-port basis would allow validation of network traffic itself, not just whether a host should be accessing the network.  Per-port security would move the job of enforcing security away from choke-point products like firewalls (which include IPSs, application firewalls, whatever) and into switches.This is not necessarily a great idea, as this With so-called \"intelligent networking,\" points A and B have to be sure that the network will transmit their conversation, and not block, modify, or otherwise interfere with that exchange to the detriment of the end hosts.  As a security person I am obviously in favor of efforts to enforce security policies, but I am not in favor of adding another layer of complexity on top of existing infrastructures if it can be avoided.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

One of the lessons I have taken from this course is that defense seldom (if ever) wins wars.  I was reminded of this lesson when I read Tom Ptacek's Tom is replying to my \"I also do not agree [with SANS.edu] that 'knowledge... is the only defense to the growing threat.' The best defense is a strong offense. That means hunting down and prosecuting threats. No amount of defense can sufficient protect any moderately complex enterprise against determined intruders.\"Tom disagrees and says that \"Firewalls\", \"IT and Network Security teams\", and \"Vulnerability Research\" have \"done the most to improve security over the last 5 years.\"  If we consider the risk equation to be something like \"Risk = Threat X Vulnerability X Asset value\", we must realize that Tom's points all address the vulnerability side of the equation.  Applying countermeasures to the vulnerability aspect of the risk equation leaves the threat component untouched.  When the attacker is allowed freedom of maneuver, the defender will lose.  The side with initiative has the superior position, unless the defenses are so unsurmountable that attack is more costly than defense.  Let's return to the Famous Romans lecture for a moment.  Prior to the rule of the emperor When Hadrian became emperor in 117 AD, he changed Rome's foreign policy.  He decided to consolidate the empire's borders.  His most famous action was the building of , separating England from Scotland.  The wall was the ultimate statement of defense, as is sought to keep barbarians separated from Roman cities like London.  In some respects, this ultimate defensive maneuver was a success;  London flourished.  However, the building of the wall signalled weakness to Rome's enemies.  Instead of being seen as a statement of strength, barbarians interpreted as a sign the Romans would not seek to conquer them.  Rome looked weak, not strong.  Within a century Rome would come under increasing barbarian attack, and the remaining shell of the western \"empire\" was formally overthrown in 476 AD.Now, you might say that defense can prove superior to offense.  You might cite trench warfare of the late 19th century, and the horror of World War I.  In those cases, it is true that the weapons possessed by each side were so horribly destructive that attacks were fruitless and bloody endeavors.  However, the arrival of the tank and over a million US troops changed the equation.  Offensive action eventually won WWI for the allies.A particularly clever historian might say the Cold War was won by defense.  Some argue the US out-spent, or had the capability to out-spend, Soviet Russia.  That is true.  Another factor was President Reagan's plan to build the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, or \"Star Wars.)  SDI changed the security situation for the Soviets.  The security paradigm of \"mutually assured destruction\" held that seeking to wipe out the enemy was a worthless action.  Once the enemy detected missile launches, he could reply with his own volley.  Both sets of missiles would wipe out each side's weapons, leaving neither with an advantage to leverage in a post-exchange world.SDI altered this nuclear attack outcome.  With SDI deployed, the US could potentially preserve some of its weapons for a second round of attacks.  This second round gave the US superiority over its Soviet opponent.  Suddenly a nuclear war became \"winnable,\" as insane as that sounds.  In this case, then, defense was important, but only to preserve the weapons of offense.In the final analysis, what makes you feel safer -- a lack of criminals on your street, or iron bars on your windows?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Now, Halvar may be really smart, but it doesn't mean Halvar's argument makes sense in the context that most people share when software monoculture is debated. Halvar writes exploits.  That is his mindset and worldview.  Here is the scenario he outlines:\"[T]ake a useful piece of information (for example, a source tarball) and distribute it randomly on a small subset of the computers in the organisation. In the monoculture example, I would need an exploit for the monocultureOS. In the diversity example, I need an exploit for any of the OSs on which the information that I want is stored. Joy. Please diversify!\"According to this reasoning, Halvar thinks software monoculture improves security.  By operating a diverse set of operating systems, the target organization seems weaker to Halvar.  He can steal that \"useful piece of information\" from the weakest OS operated by the organization.That argument makes sense if the goal of \"security\" is to deny access to a piece of information stored on a variety of hosts.  Call that a confidentiality goal.What if the goal of \"security\" is not confidentiality, but accessibility?  In that case, I argue monoculture is a stupid idea, and diversity is stronger.  Imagine saving copies of that piece of information on systems all running the same OS.  A destructive worm appears and wipes out the hard drives of all of the organization's hosts.  Now what?  In the diverse world, the information on the vulnerable OS is wiped out by the worm.  However, copies of the information survive on the other OS'.  If your goal is survivability, I can't see how software monoculture is a good idea.

The stolen documents included technical specifications, product designs, prospective customers, customer proposals, client account information and pricing.Niku discovered the break-in after a Business Engine salesman made an unsolicited call to one of Niku's prospective clients, a Nike employee who happened to be related to Niku's chief information officer, Warren Leggett. The call raised suspicion because the Nike employee was not ordinarily responsible for software purchasing decisions, had never heard of Business Engine and had no idea how the salesman had obtained his contact information, according a declaration by Leggett.The incident prompted Leggett to examine his company's computer logs and files from his recent meeting with Nike. He quickly determined from a trail of Internet network addresses that someone from outside the company had been stealing files. Leggett was able to trace the intrusions back to Business Engine by using Internet domain registration information and publicly available Internet tools.\" (emphasis added)Whoa.

Here is part of an explanation:\"Cyber violence in its multiple forms at all levels of the Internet is a major problem. One large ISP averages 1,000 DDOS attacks per day. Although arrests and prosecutions for worm writers and malicious employees who harm their current or former employers' IT systems have increased, the threat level has also increased. Organized crime has been rapidly moving into phishing, the fastest growing crime segment. The path we are on does not lead to peace or security in cyberspace.The Latin word scientia, the root of our word for science, means knowledge, which is the only defense to the growing threat. If we do not know how to harden systems, manage change, design networks and ensure that software is developed securely, we remain vulnerable to Internet predators.\"I do not buy the concept of \"cyber violence\" in the context of attacks by intruders.  (Cyber violence is a term usually reserved for  facilitated by Internet access.)  I also do not agree that \"knowledge... is the only defense to the growing threat.\"  The best defense is a strong offense.  That means hunting down and prosecuting threats.  No amount of defense can sufficiently protect any moderately complex enterprise against determined intruders.Does anyone plan to pursue either of the two SANS.edu degrees?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I first met Marcus when I was an Air Force captain at the AFCERT and he was an Army Major at the JTF-CND.Marcus mentioned a project that caught my attention:\"We're also building a database of large data sets collected from the internet. The intent is to help researchers who might be working on a new security device.Rather than trying to connect to their own networks and pull live data in from their university network, or wherever they are doing the research, we want to provide them with real data sets that have been collected from the internet, but properly sanitized and anonymized...In a technical sense, this is easy. All you have to do is hook a computer up and start recording. But you end up picking up a lot of private information. We have been working on this with lawyers, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and the Electronic Freedom Foundation, among others.This is going to be remarkable because we'll be able to create anonymous data sets that actually reflect what the hostile internet looks like, but that the privacy people are OK with. Both the public and the private sector will have access to this database, but they will have to be vetted if they want to use it. If Al Qaeda wants access, we won't grant it, but if the Atlanta Police Department wants to train some cybercops, then that's cool.SC: When will this be done?Sachs: We're getting close. We could see this come online later this year or early next year. We're just working out the last details with the lawyers.\"This sounds very interesting, and similar to , maybe).Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

It was an important step to recognize that space would be another arena for combat.  Now the new mission statement has added cyberspace to the list of arenas in which the Air Force will fight.  The Air Force has been fighting in cyberspace for decades.  The battle became especially interesting in the early 1990s when we decided to deploy ASIM sensors to monitor networks.  ASIM, or Automated Security Incident Measurement, was a network-based IDS built on Todd Heberlein's Network Security Monitor (NSM).  NSM was the first network-based IDS.  Prior to NSM, intrusion detection was done by watching activity on hosts.I am gratified to see the Air Force step up to the plate and declare that it will have a formal operational cyberspace responsibility.

I would like to take a historical and technical look at digital security failures on a case-by-case basis.  Ideally the cases would be based on testimony from witnesses or participants wishing to (anonymously) share lessons with their colleagues.  My concept is simple: when a bridge fails in the \"analog\" world, everyone knows about it.  The disaster is visible, and engineers can analyze and learn from the event.  The lessons they take away make future bridges stronger and safer.  I do not see this happening in the digital world.  Organizations suffer disasters all the time due to poor techniques, tools, configuration, management decisions, and so on.  Unfortunately, few people ever hear about these problems, so they are repeated elsewhere.  The only parties to benefit are intruders.  Security engineers never get to learn from the mistakes of others.What would a sample story look like?  As a simple example, I know of an ISP who suffered a two hour router ACL drop that allowed remote intruders to exploit their development network.  The ISP suffered a major compromise by Russian intruders that required a dedicated multi-week, guerilla-warfare incident response effort.  Several lessons can be learned: (1) a router with an ACL is not a firewall, especially when you can attack any high port using source port 20 TCP; (2) development networks with unpatched machines should not bear publicly routable IP addresses and be Internet facing; and (3) there is value in monitoring to detect when your defensive measures fail.Would any of you be willing to share your stories with me?  I would be willing to communicate in any reasonable manner you wish to preserve your identities and sensitivities.  The goal of the book is to provide real-world cases that can teach lessons to fellow security engineers.  I am not trying to embarrass or humiliate anyone.  I do not expect to hear any company or personal names, and if you still provide them I will not repeat them in the book.  I am most interested in stories that have plenty of technical details.Please email your thoughts to richard at taosecurity dot com.

The 2005 list, in contrast, displays the following vulnerabilities:Top Vulnerabilities in Windows Systems        * W1. Windows Services        * W2. Internet Explorer        * W3. Windows Libraries        * W4. Microsoft Office and Outlook Express        * W5. Windows Configuration WeaknessesTop Vulnerabilities in Cross-Platform Applications        * C1. Backup Software        * C2. Anti-virus Software        * C3. PHP-based Applications        * C4. Database Software        * C5. File Sharing Applications        * C6. DNS Software        * C7. Media Players        * C8. Instant Messaging Applications        * C9. Mozilla and Firefox Browsers        * C10. Other Cross-platform ApplicationsTop Vulnerabilities in UNIX Systems        * U1. UNIX Configuration Weaknesses        * U2. Mac OS XTop Vulnerabilities in Networking Products        * N1. Cisco IOS and non-IOS Products        * N2. Juniper, CheckPoint and Symantec Products        * N3. Cisco Devices Configuration WeaknessesBravo.  I think that is a significant step towards realizing the scope of the problem at hand.  To be fair to Microsoft, I believe there could have been \"Unix services\" and \"Unix libraries\" sections.  I applaud the addition of network products and other applications.  Content-wise, this is a great resource.Now, \"the bad.\"  The top of the page has this link: .  For Pete's sake, the title of the document is \"The Twenty Most Critical Internet Security Vulnerabilities.\"  These are not threats.  Let's see other terms in use:In the introduction we see:\"In addition to Windows and UNIX categories, we have also included Cross-Platform Applications and Networking Products. The change reflects the dynamic nature of the evolving threat landscape.\"  I can accept this use of the term threat, if the intent is to refer to parties who exploit vulnerabilities.Next:\"We will update the list and the instructions as more critical threats and more current or convenient methods of protection are identified, and we welcome your input along the way.\"Here, threats should be \"vulnerabilities\".Section C2:\"Compromising a gateway could potentially cause a much larger impact since the gateway is the outer layer of protection and the only protection for some threats in many small organizations.\"This should either replace \"threats\" with \"vulnerabilities\", or \"for some\" with \"from some\".Section C5:\"The main threats arising from P2P software are:\"I think threats should be \"risks\" here, although the list is a muddle of different issues.Later in that section:\"The number of threats using P2P, IM, IRC, and CIFS within Symantec's top 50 malicious code reports has increased by 39% over the previous six-month period.\"Here, I can accept the use of the term as long as the intent is to describe parties abusing P2P, IM, etc.Section C8:\"These applications provide an increasing security threat to an organization. The major threats are the following:\"Here's a simple rule of thumb: applications can never be \"threats.\"  Again, I suggest replacing the second \"threats\" here with \"risks\".One final note: I am not a lone voice speaking on this subject.  The , of all people, is linked from the SANS page with a story Hackers pose new threat to desktop software.  That's the proper use of the term threat, since a hacker is a \"party.\"Security will not be taken seriously as a \"profession\" until its \"thought leaders\" use basic terms properly.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "It's tough to keep up with syntax changes in Today when trying Tethereal 0.10.13, I discovered the syntax has changed again.  First, the relevant man page excerpt:       -a  Specify a criterion that specifies when Tethereal is to stop writ-           ing to a capture file.  The criterion is of the form test:value,           where test is one of:           duration:value Stop writing to a capture file after value seconds           have elapsed.           filesize:value Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a           size of value kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1024 bytes). If this           option is used together with the -b option, Ethereal will stop           writing to the current capture file and switch to the next one if           filesize is reached.           files:value Stop writing to capture files after value number of           files were written.       -b  Cause Tethereal to run in \"multiple files\" mode.  In \"multiple           files\" mode, Tethereal will write to several capture files. When           the first capture file fills up, Tethereal will switch writing to           the next file and so on.           The created filenames are based on the filename given with the -w           flag, the number of the file and on the creation date and time,           e.g. savefile_00001_20050604120117.pcap, save-           file_00001_20050604120523.pcap, ...           With the files option it's also possible to form a \"ring buffer\".           This will fill up new files until the number of files specified, at           which point Tethereal will discard the data in the first file and           start writing to that file and so on. If the files option is not           set, new files filled up until one of the capture stop conditions           match (or until the disk if full).           The criterion is of the form key:value, where key is one of:           duration:value switch to the next file after value seconds have           elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up.           filesize:value switch to the next file after it reaches a size of           value kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1024 bytes).           files:value begin again with the first file after value number of           files were written (form a ring buffer).Ok, so how do I use this?  I create the following simple shell script:#!/bin/sh# Capture file size in KB; here is 1 GB#FILESIZE=1000000# Here is 100 MBFILESIZE=100000# Number of files to capture FILENUMBER=5# Interface to watchINTERFACE=fxp0/usr/X11R6/bin/tethereal -n -i $INTERFACE -s 1515 -q -a filesize:$FILESIZE -b files:$FILENUMBER -w /nsm1/lpc/fullcontent.lpcThe preceding script tells Tethereal to collect five 100,000 KB files.  When the fifth one reaches the 100 MB limit, Tethereal begins overwriting the first one.  Check out these directory listings as time progresses.  First, the initial capture file.  Notice the naming convention Tethereal uses.

I have seen commanders institute similar policies on operations floors, but generally you're expected to stand when the commander enters a meeting room.The FCW article did not say much about what constitutes a network \"stand-down,\" other than \"changing passwords\" and \"conduct[ing] certain activities to strengthen and become more aware of network security.\"  Can anyone elaborate on this?  A department-wide password change sounds like an immense incident response action.

The rest of the community wants to verify that their aircraft are not also afflicted.  I believe the  intrusions may be the \"crash\" that prompted this stand-down.

IDSes, however, have the upper hand in identifying intrusions, because they have the luxury of generating an alert based on traffic from the attacker to the victim or from the victim to the client. In other words, an IDS can alert on either the inbound attack traffic or the outbound victim response. But to prevent an intrusion, an IPS must deny incoming attack traffic. An IPS that only inspects outbound traffic allows a target to be compromised.

I try to stay current with people and companies performing security work, but I had never heard of PMG.  I looked at the description of the course, wondering if the \"network\" meant \"enterprise,\" as in \"how to use forensics in the enterprise.\"  I think that is a misapplication of the term network in that context, but it's common enough.  Alternatively, perhaps \"network\" meant \"traffic,\" which is how I use the term.  When I mention \"network forensics,\" I define it as the art of collecting, protecting,analyzing, and presenting network traffic to support remediation or prosecution.  This is in line with the :\"1.  The art or study of formal debate; argumentation. 2. The use of science and technology to investigate and establish facts in criminal or civil courts of law.\"It turns out PMG's use of the term \"Network Forensics\" has nothing to do with any recognized application of the term.  They say:\"Network Forensics is the study of the micro transactions of inter-network components, platforms and the applications that process on and across them. By taking a forensic measurement of a micro transaction, quantifying the repeated dependency on the micro to that of the macro we can quantify the improvement for an end user that specific IT optimizations might provide. On the business process side, quantification of the cost of the macro transaction time spent by an end user can be quantified in annual cost or lost productivity associated with slow applications. Knowing optimization improvements and their associated costs allows a long term ROI to be considered. The result? Best bang for the buck optimization!Come join PMG NetAnalyst in a day of cross technology, vendor independent network training with a twist: PMG will take you on a journey down several complex multi-vendor network environments where troubles abound. You will be taught how to use a well rounded 'bag of tools' to analyze and troubleshoot the issues as well as how applying best practices could have avoided these issues. Forensics Day will show you how to save money as well as improve performance and reliability by using 'brain cells' instead of budget to solve and even prevent problems.\"Please.  This is not \"network forensics\" by any stretch of the imagination.  This is an attempt to add a sexy name to the otherwise boring ideas of network troubleshooting.  The latest iteration and expansion of the concept uses the term , which I learned about recently though the  magazine.I understand there are similar uses of the term \"forensics\" outside of the legal realm.  However, \"network forensics\" has had a security association for years.  I would like to see it stay that way to avoid further cluttering our professional landscape.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Here are excerpts:\"For many users and vendors, network security is dependent on a collection of open-source programs that provide key capabilities, sometimes as standalone tools and sometimes as the basis for commercial products. Last month, however, the open-source status of two of those key technologies--Snort and Nessus--became threatened....The moral is that heavy reliance on open source carries risk, and that the greatest insurance policy for open-source technology is participation by a large number of users and developers. If you're thinking of using open source, keep a close eye on what happens to both Snort and Nessus.\"I would argue that open source carries much less \"risk\" when compared to closed applications.  The fact that the code is open is the \"greatest insurance policy,\" not \"participation by a large number of users and developers.\"  If an open source program is no longer maintained, it can be assumed by another developer.  Assuming the license is truly open, that new developer can resume the project, fork it, or rebuild from scratch using the original as inspiration.  For example, Linux guru Tim Lawless started the  project to protect the integrity of the Linux kernel, but had to abandon coding it in 2002.  Last week Rodrigo Rubira Branco took over maintainership and released a new version.   is a third example.  None of this would be possible with so-called less \"risky\" closed programs.The second example of Network Computing missing the mark appeared in the following \"I have a question concerning an application one of my consultancy clients needs that's targeted for Microsoft Data Center Server 2003, a product used to manage DPM, on Unisys 3S7000. The systems integrator is saying that 'for performance reasons,' it plans to 'modify the operating system' for the application.It's been a long time since I've heard of any vendor advocating modification of a native OS to boost performance or achieve goals not supported by the OS. I've been all over Microsoft's OEM partner site and haven't read anything about using Data Center Server as an OEM product. Not even its predecessor, Data Center Server 2000, was ever available as a shrinkwrapped product; you had to have Microsoft services to implement it.Have you ever heard of any vendor wanting to tweak the Windows kernel in order to support its application? Sounds risky...Don MacVittie replies: Larry, your instincts are dead-on. Even in the Linux world, tweaking the OS for the application layer is generally considered taboo. There's just too much that can go wrong.Are you sure the vendor is talking about making code changes to the kernel? Maybe what it has in mind is custom drivers, which are more acceptable, or a custom build, which is relatively common for OEMs.If the vendor really does want to modify the kernel, you should tell your client to run away from it as fast as it can. There are enough good products out there to handle high-volume backups and replication without having to resort to such a drastic measure.\"Good grief.  \"Even in the Linux world, tweaking the OS for the application layer is generally considered taboo. There's just too much that can go wrong.\"  Like what, better performance?  I do not know if it is possible for end users to make any modifications to the Windows kernel, perhaps via a sysctl mechanism as found in BSD.  I do not fault the NWC writer for advising users to stay away from Windows kernel tweaks.  Linux and BSD are completely different beasts.  I find the power to alter the kernel to be an advantage, not voodoo.  In production I make few kernel customizations on BSD not because I am scared and need to \"run away.\"  I only make the customizations with which I am familiar, like adding support for IPSec or NAT.  If I encountered a problem that could be addressed by customizing the kernel, I would take full advantage of the control that an open source OS provides.What are your thoughts on these issues?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

From the Ben Rothke's Computer Security: 20 Things Every Employee Should Know, 2nd Ed, contains a great deal of sound advice for nontechnical employees. At least 10 tips could be eliminated by combining redundancies. I would reduce the list to the following topics:(1) Beware malware, spyware, and phishing; (2) Protect your identity; (3) Protect the organization's data; (4) Choose sound passwords and protect them; (5) Use organization resources for authorized purposes; (6) Beware of social engineers; (7) Call the experts when things go wrong; (8) Protect laptops, PDAs, cell phones, and other mobile devices as you would corporate resources. I also reviewed  by Andrew Conry-Murray and Vincent Weafer.  I gave this book four stars.  From the The Symantec Guide to Home Internet Security (TSGTHIS) is Symantec's latest offering in its new series of books published through Addison-Wesley. This is a very solid introductory desktop security book for home power users. This is not the book to give to your grandmother, unless she likes to tweak Windows or wants to understand differences between file infector and polymorphic viruses. With one caveat, I liked this book...The book suffers one major flaw that robbed a star from my rating. The single most important defensive measure a home user can take is to not perform daily operations as a user with administrative privileges. Home users should not browse the Web, read email, chat in IM, write documents, or do much anything else using an admin account. Users should only assume admin level power when they need to install software or authorized Active X controls. This single defensive measure is not mentioned by TSGTHIS, but it has protected numerous customers and my family from thousands of client-side attacks.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Here's another anecdote from the Engineering Disasters story I wrote about  was struck and sunk by the ocean liner Stockholm.  At that time radar was still a fairly new innovation on sea vessels.  Ship bridges were dimly lit, and the controls on radar systems were not illuminated.  It is possible that the Stockholm  misinterpreted the readings on their equipment, believing the Andrea Doria was 12 miles away when it was really 2 miles away.  The ships literally turned towards one another on a collision course, based on faulty interpretation of radar contact in the dense fog.  Catastrophe ensued.  This disaster shows how humans can never be removed from the equation, and they are often at center stage when failures occur.  The commentator on the show said a 10 cent ligh bulb illuminating the radar controls station could have shown the radar range was positioned in a setting different from that assumed by the operator.  Following the Andrea Doria collision, illumintation was added to ship radar controls.  This story reminded me that the latest security technology is worthless -- or even worse, damaging -- in the hands of people who are not trained or able to use it properly.On a different subject, I heard an interview on NPR with Health and Human Services Secretary  about bird flu.  He likened the situation to \"surveillance\" of a dry forest during fire season.  He said that the best defense was vigilance and rapid response.  His analogy assumed being nearby when a small fire erupts.  First responders who are quickly on the scene can stamp out a fire before it becomes uncontrollable.  If the response team is unaware of the fire, it can spread and then be beyond containment.  He concluded the interview saying \"ultimately, another pandemic will come.  Right now we are not prepared.\"I thought his comments applied well to digital security incidents.  NSM is surveillance, and incident response helps stamp out fires (or bird flu outbreaks) quickly before they exceed an organization's capacity to deal with them.  Is your organization ready?

        "content": "During the last two months my work for .First is  by James Boney.  I put this book next to my copy of O'Reilly's .  This book looks like an excellent reference for Cisco admins and anyone pursuing an advanced Cisco certification (beyond the CCNA).  I may read the first 350 pages, as the chapters in that half of the book each address a topic of interest, like IP routing or QoS.  The last half of the book is a command syntax reference. by Craig Hunt and Roberta Bragg is sitting in my reference section next to O'Reilly's  and .  The book appears to be a comprehensive overview of networking services from a Microsoft perspective.  Next I turn to books I plan to read and review. by Magnus Lie Hetland is an update of his 2002 book .  I originally tried to learn  in early 2004, but I bailed on that book after a few chapters.  I am really excited to try again with Magnus' book.  I consider it to be the gateway to a series of other excellent  and , which I plan to read.  (I hope O'Reilly's  will be a good addition to this trio.)  I plan to read this book as part of my programming education, which will start once I clear the books which follow.Ben Rothke sent me a copy of his updated book .  This is a booklet that would be appropriate as part of digital security awareness campaign in a company of any size.  After skimming through it, the advice seems sound and I would have no problem recommending the book to clients. by Andrew Conry-Murray and Vincent Weafer is Symantec's latest foray into the security publishing world.  This is a fairly short book, which makes sense given the level of interest and expertise of the intended audience.  I would be pleased with it if I could imagine sending it to my parents -- maybe with a copy of FreeBSD?  (Probably not!) by Steven S. Warren is a new book from .  I had this book on my  for months before I bought a copy at a local Borders.  A few days later the publisher shipped me one!  They must have read my wish list.  This book looks like a thorough and easy-to-read overview of Workstation features.  With the introduction of Teams, Snapshots, Clones, and other advances over the 3.x and 4.x lines, I look forward to learning how to make the best use of VMware in my classes and in testing scenarios.I have not abandoned plans for a TaoSecurity Podcast. I hope two books can give me advice on how best to proceed.  The first I plan to read is Todd Cochrane's , published by Wiley.  This was one of the first podcasting books to appear that got reasonable Amazon.com reviews.  I hope to gain some insights on how best to create podcasts using minimal equipment.Shortly after I received a copy of the previous book, I learned of Jack Herrington's .  The  series usually contain lots of good advice, but the format is seldom read cover-to-cover.  It's more an assortment of helpful tips and tools.Three books from Syngress are next.  First is  by Christian B. Lahti and Roderick Peterson.  I will admit up front that I will bail on this book unless it hooks me.  I am not a regulatory compliance person, but I would like to learn a little more about SOX and COBIT.  I would like this book to provide the background I need to understand these issues. by Paul Craig and Ron Honick will be good if it follows in the footsteps of an earlier Syngress book, .  I don't know much about modern software piracy, so I thought this book might provide a glimpse into that threat sector.Customizing Open Source Security Applications by Brian Caswell, Gilbert Ramirez, Jay Beale, Noam Rathaus and Neil Archibald looks like a great book.  The only existing review on  by Michael Kofler looks like a great overview of features found in MySQL 5, which is currently a release candidate at version 5.0.13.  The \"generally available\" version is 4.1.15, which is the one people are most likely encouraged to use in production.  Once MySQL 5 leaves RC status, I plan to incorporate it into my , along with FreeBSD 6.0 and Sguil 0.6.0.  All three components should be ready within the next several weeks.After years of no publications about  by David B. Harris, Jaldhar Vyas.  Now we have No Starch's  by Martin F. Krafft.  I am much more willing to devote time to a new operating system when it is backed by books.  Online documentation is fine, but a published book is something I can recommend to others in a physical form.  It carries much more weight (literally) than online documentation.  I plan to evaluate how I might integrate Debian into my lab, although I already have it running on a PA-RISC box that normally hosts HP-UX.Finally we arrive at , a collection of essays edited by Lorrie Faith Cranor and Simson Garfinkel.  I think this is the sort of book I might read on a cross-US flight.  I am not a big fan of collections of essays, but in a captive environment (i.e., stuck on a plane) I might find sanctuary in the ideas contained in this book.So that's a ton of new books.  My personal  currently shows 24 non-programming and 24 programming books on my bookshelf.  That does not count reference books that I have pre-reviewed but do not plan to read cover-to-cover.  My  shows another 21 books on the horizon that appear interesting.  Since I do not have any new major writing projects planned for the next year, I would like to make progress on all of this reading.

        "content": "My TiVo managed to save a few more episodes of .  You may remember I First,  of  offered the following story about problems with the Hubble Space Telescope.  When Hubble was built on earth, engineers did not sufficiently address issues with the weight of the lens on Earth and deflections caused by gravity.  When Hubble was put in orbit, the lens no longer deflected and as a result it was not the proper shape.  Engineers on Earth had never tested the lens because they could not figure out a way to do it.  So, they launched and hoped for the best -- only to encounter a disaster that required a $50 million orbital repair mission.  Dr. McCarthy's comment was \"A single test is worth a thousand expert opinions.\"  This is an example of management by fact instead of management by belief, mentioned previously on this blog.Second, , author of , explained the makings of a disaster.  Essentially, he said disasters are caused by the unforeseen consequences of multiple, individually non-devastating, failures in complex systems.  Most catastrophes could be prevented if any one of the small failures had not occurred. Third, Mary Schiavo commented on the Challenger disaster.  She described the well-known problems with operating the Shuttle's rocket O-rings in temperatures below 53 degrees F.  The Shuttle had launched at lower temperatures prior to the Challenger explosion, but NASA knew they were risking catastrophe.  Ms. Schiavo said NASA engineers begged their managers not to let Challenger launch, seeing that chunks of ice covered the launch pad and Shuttle.  They were overruled and disaster occurred.  This struck a chord with me, because a few days earlier I read a new story in Apple CEO Steve Jobs [will] tell you an instructive little story. Call it the Parable of the Concept Car. \"Here's what you find at a lot of companies,\" he says, kicking back in a conference room at Apple's gleaming white Silicon Valley headquarters, which looks something like a cross between an Ivy League university and an iPod. \"You know how you see a show car, and it's really cool, and then four years later you see the production car, and it sucks? And you go, What happened? They had it! They had it in the palm of their hands! They grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory!\"What happened was, the designers came up with this really great idea. Then they take it to the engineers, and the engineers go, 'Nah, we can't do that. That's impossible.' And so it gets a lot worse. Then they take it to the manufacturing people, and they go, 'We can't build that!' And it gets a lot worse.\"When Jobs took up his present position at Apple in 1997, that's the situation he found. He and Jonathan Ive, head of design, came up with the original iMac, a candy-colored computer merged with a cathode-ray tube that, at the time, looked like nothing anybody had seen outside of a Jetsons cartoon. \"Sure enough,\" Jobs recalls, \"when we took it to the engineers, they said, 'Oh.' And they came up with 38 reasons. And I said, 'No, no, we're doing this.' And they said, 'Well, why?' And I said, 'Because I'm the CEO, and I think it can be done.'\"Would Steve Jobs have overruled the NASA engineers and launched Challenger?  Who knows.From what I have learned, disasters are prone to happen in complex, tightly-coupled systems.  The only way to try to avoid them is to test and monitor their operation, exercise response, and then implement those plans when catastrophe occurs.  Anything less is like launching a defective, untested Hubble and hoping for the best, and then paying through the nose to clean up the mess.Here are a few footnotes to this post.  Dr. McCarthy's company offers  services, including services for .  They are described thus:  \"We have assembled one of the largest private collections of computerized accident and incident data in the world. Our web-based solutions put this information at your disposal, giving you comprehensive risk data quickly and at low cost.\"  Dr. McCarthy was recently elected to the , which has a  with a  project.

Mike looked at Cisco, and  looked at Sourcefire's Snort.I am sure  that Let's consider the factors that lead me to believe that the Snort BO vulnerability will produce a worm.The new vulnerability can be exploited by a specially crafted  to or from any port other than port 31337.  (Thanks to Jose Nazario for correcting me on this point.) This is similar to the UDP packet used by Witty.  UDP is an ideal worm vector, as demonstrated by Sensors need not be directly targeted.  All a worm has to do is send exploit UDP traffic to a segment monitored by a vulnerable Snort sensor.  The attacker need not know anything about the target's management IP address.Snort has been in the news recently as a result of its .  A worm coder can kill or embarrass two birds with one UDP stone.Snort is everywhere -- .com, .net, .org, .edu, .gov, etc.  0wning a .mil or .gov Snort sensor gives intruders the ultimate vantage point over a monitored network.  I imagine sophisticated intruders have already compromised a slew of sensitive Snort sensors, but at some point a lower life form will decide to turn the exploit into a worm.Snort source code is available, so comparing 2.4.0-2.4.2 with 2.4.3 means the vulnerability can be quickly identified.I can imagine a few factors that will reduce the likelihood of a worm.The vulnerability reportedly exists in Snort versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.2.  That's a narrow set of versions, given Snort 2.4.0 was released in July.  I have heard of users running Snort 1.8.x and 1.9.x; they complain about rules that don't work with their versions.  Argh!Snort runs on a huge number of platforms.  That is one of the beauties of the program.  Will a worm target Snort on Linux?  If so, what distro/kernel/version/etc.?  How about Snort on Windows?  That would make the most sense -- the OS would be fairly similar, and the user base would make for good targets.  We'll see.Sophisticated intruders will keep any exploit to themselves.  They may try to keep it out of the hands of the bottom feeders.What do you think?  Will we see a Snort worm?

If you look closely enough, prior to ultimate failure you see indications of pending doom.  Cracks appear in concrete, materials swell or contract, groaning noises abound, etc.  This is generally not the case in the digital world.  It is possible for an enterprise to be completely owned by unauthorized parties, without any overt signs.

A thorough reading of this document is recommended to understand which concepts and practical details are expected to be mastered.Throughout this document, a clear distinction is placed on 'recognizing' and 'understanding', versus 'demonstrating' and 'performing'. Certain objectives call for the mere understanding of certain topics, while others call for the ability to demonstrate performance level knowledge of the topic...Successful mastery of the BSDA examination will, in most cases, require study and practice. The requirements for the exam encompass more background in BSD than is common among casual users or those new to BSD. This is a deliberate decision by the BSD Certification Group- to encourage more cross learning among BSD systems so that breadth of understanding of BSD is as heavily tasked as depth of understanding. The result will be a more well-rounded BSD advocate and a more knowledgeable system administrator.\"The objectives describe seven domains:Installing and Upgrading the OS and SoftwareSecuring the OSFiles, Filesystems, and DisksUsers and Accounts ManagementBasic System AdministrationNetwork AdministrationBasic Unix SkillsInside the document describes the audience for the certification:\"The BSDA certification is designed to be an entry-level certification on BSD Unix systems administration. Testing candidates with a general Unix background, but less than six months of work experience as a BSD systems administrator (or who wish to obtain employment as a BSD systems administrator) will benefit most from this certification.\"Also:\"[T]he SDA certification is only valid for 5 years. Existing BSDAs who wish to maintain their certification will need to recertify every 5 years. Details on how to recertify will be publicly available in a document to be published in 2006.\"I like this approach.  I disagree that DragonFly BSD should be included, since something like 2% of all BSD administrators use DragonFly.  The guide is 57 pages long, so I will need time to read everything.  At first glance it looks like great work.  Although I am still listed on the  page, I have requested resignation as I have absolutely no time to work on the project while running Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

According to the :\"The policy mandates, effective 1 July 2002, that departments and agencies within the Executive Branch shall acquire, for use on national security systems, only those COTS products or cryptographic modules that have been validated with the International Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS), or by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Cryptographic Module Validation Program.Additionally, subject to policy and guidance for non-national security systems, NSTISSP # 11 notes that departments and agencies may wish to consider the acquisition of validated COTS products for use in information systems that may be associated with the operation of critical infrastructures as defined in the Presidential Decision Directive on Critical Infrastructure Protection (PDD-63).\" [emphasis added]Those bold sections make all the difference.

Sourcefire released Snort 2.4.1, a vulnerability bug fix, on Friday.  They only released an updated snort-2.4.1.tar.gz archive.  There were no Linux RPMs or Win32 installation packages.I decided to learn what was involved with compiling Snort on Windows.  Right now I will say I did not finish the job.  I am not a Windows programmer.  I do not use Windows as a software development platform.  Today was the first day I used the tools I describe below.  The purpose of this post is to demonstrate that compiling Snort on Windows is not rocket science.  First, notice the snort-2.4.1.tar.gz archive has a src\\win32 directory with these contents:Makefile.inWIN32-CodeWIN32-IncludesWIN32-PrjWIN32-LibrariesMakefile.amThis looks promising.  Let's see the contents of the WIN32-Prj directory.snort_installer.nsibuild_releases.batsnort_installer_options.inisnort.dswsnort.dsppcre.dllLibnetNT.dllsnort.maksnort.depsnort.dsp is a Visual C++ project file.  I don't have Visual C++ on my Windows 2000 laptop.  A visit to MSDN shows  is free for download.  I retrieve and install the program.  After agreeing to convert Sourcefire's Visual C++ 6 files into a newer format, I am ready to try to \"Build\" Snort.Along the way I read an error about a missing executable called mc.  David Bianco in #snort-gui hypothesizes that mc means , a program available in the .  Since the SDK works fine on Windows 2000, I install it.  I also edit my system's environment variables so Windows knows where to find mc.exe in the future.Once Visual Studio knows how to find mc.exe, it begins complaining about finding header files found in the C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Platform SDK\\Include directory like winsock2.h.  Remember, I have never used Visual Studio before, and I have read no documentation.  I figure the easiest way forward is to just copy the contents of the C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Platform SDK\\Include directory into the src\\win32\\WIN32-Includes directory.  That problem is solved.My next hurdle involves providing Snort with the At this point I run into a problem caused by the Visual Studio project's insistence on building a version of Snort with database support.  I figure the easiest once to build is a \"release\" version for MySQL (as opposed to a \"debug\" version).  During the build I see an error about mysql_time.h not being found.  I download the Windows source for MySQL 4.0.26 only to find mysql_time.h is not in the mysql-4.0.26\\include directory.  I then download 5.0.12-BETA and see mysql-5.0.12-beta\\include has mysql_time.h, just as I needed.After taking care of relating library file locations, I had everything I needed to progress to the linking stage.  Unfortunately, this was where my build process ended with the following errors:Linking...util.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__DeregisterEventSource@4 referenced in function _CreateApplicationEventLogEntrysyslog.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__DeregisterEventSource@4util.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__ReportEventA@36 referenced in function _CreateApplicationEventLogEntrysyslog.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__ReportEventA@36util.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegisterEventSourceA@8 referenced in function _CreateApplicationEventLogEntrysyslog.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegisterEventSourceA@8misc.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__IsTextUnicode@12 referenced in function _print_interfacesyslog.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegCloseKey@4 referenced in function _AddEventSourcewin32_service.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegCloseKey@4mysqlclient.lib(my_init.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegCloseKey@4syslog.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegSetValueExA@24 referenced in function _AddEventSourcewin32_service.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegSetValueExA@24syslog.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegCreateKeyA@12 referenced in function _AddEventSourcewin32_service.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegQueryValueExA@24 referenced in function _ReadServiceCommandLineParamswin32_service.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegOpenKeyExA@20 referenced in function _ReadServiceCommandLineParamsmysqlclient.lib(my_init.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegOpenKeyExA@20win32_service.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__SetServiceStatus@8 referenced in function _SnortServiceCtrlHandler@4win32_service.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__CloseServiceHandle@4 referenced in function _InstallSnortServicewin32_service.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__CreateServiceA@52 referenced in function _InstallSnortServicewin32_service.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__OpenSCManagerA@12 referenced in function _InstallSnortServicewin32_service.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegCreateKeyExA@36 referenced in function _InstallSnortServicewin32_service.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__DeleteService@4 referenced in function _UninstallSnortServicewin32_service.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__OpenServiceA@12 referenced in function _UninstallSnortServicewin32_service.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegDeleteKeyA@8 referenced in function _UninstallSnortServicewin32_service.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegisterServiceCtrlHandlerA@8 referenced in function _SnortServiceStart@8win32_service.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__StartServiceCtrlDispatcherA@4 referenced in function _SnortServiceMainmysqlclient.lib(my_init.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol __imp__RegEnumValueA@32 referenced in function _my_win_init.\\snort___Win32_MySQL_Release/snort.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 20 unresolved externalsI do not know how to fix these unresolved external symbols.

        "content": "I watched an episode of  on the  this afternoon.  It was , one in a series of videos on engineering failures.  A few thoughts came to mind while watching the show.  I will provide commentary on each topic addressed by the episode.First discussed was the  liquified natural gas (LNG) fire.  Engineers built a new LNG tank out of material that failed when exposed to cold, torching nearby homes and businesses when ignited.  128 people died.  Engineers were not aware of the metal's failure properties, and absolutely no defensive measures were in place around the tank to protect civilian infrastructure.  This disaster revealed the need to (1) implement plans and defenses to contain catastrophe, (2) monitor to detect problems and warn potential victims, and (3) thoroughly test designs against possible environmental conditions prior to implementation.  These days LNG tanks are surrounded by berms capable of containing a complete spill, and they are closely monitored for problems.  Homes and businesses are also located far away from the tanks.Next came the  walkway collapse that killed 114 people.  A construction change  resulted in an incredibly weak implementation that failed under load.  Cost was not to blame; a part that might have prevented failure cost less than $1.  Instead, lack of oversight, poor accountability, broken processes, a rushed build, and compromise of the original design resulted in disaster.  This case introduced me to the term \"structural engineer of record,\" a person who assigns a seal to the plans used to construct a building.  The two engineers of record for the Hyatt plans lost their licenses.  I wonder what would happen if network architectures were stamped by \"security engineers of record?\"  If they were not willing to afix their stamp, that would indicate problems they could not tolerate.  If they are willing to stamp a plan, and massive failure from poor design occurs, the engineer should be fired.The third event was a massive sink hole in 1993 in an Atlanta Marriott hotel parking lot.  A sewer drain originally built above ground decades earlier was buried 40 feet under the parking lot.  A so-called \"safety net\" built under the parking lot was supposed to provide additional security by giving hotel owners time to evacuate the premises if a sink hole began to develop.  Instead, the safety net masked the presence of the sink hole and let it enlarge until it was over 100 feet wide and beyond the net's capacity.  Two people standing in the parking lot died when the sewer, sink hole, and net collapsed.  This disaster demonstrated the importance of not operating a system (the sewer) outside of its operating design (above ground).  The event also showed how products (the net) may introduce a false sense of security and/or unintended consequences.Next came the  that killed 145,000 people.  The floods were the result of extended rain that overcame levees built decades earlier by amateur builders, usually farmers protecting their lands.  The Chinese government's relief efforts were hampered by the Japanese invasion and subsequent civil war.  This disaster showed the weaknesses of defenses built by amateurs, for which no one is responsible.  It also showed how other security incidents can degrade recovery operations.Does your organization operate critical infrastructure that someone else built before you arrived?  Perhaps it's the DNS server that no one knows how to administer.  Maybe its the time service installed on the Windows server that no one touches.  What amateur levee is waiting to break in your organization?The final disaster revolved around the deadly substance By 1972, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration arrived on the scene and chose asbestos as the first substance it would regulate.  Still, today there are hundreds of thousands of pending legal cases, but asbestos is not banned in the US.  This case demonstrated the importance of properly weighing risks against benefits.  The need to independently measure and monitor risks outside of a vendor's promises was also shown.I believe all of these cases can teach us something useful about digital security engineering.  The main difference between the first four cases and the digital security world is the failure in the analog world is blatantly obvious.  Digital failures can be far more subtle; it may take weeks or months (or years) for secuirty failures to be detected, unlike sink holes in parking lots.  The fifth case, describing asbestos, is similar to digital security because harmful effects were not immediately apparent.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Both carry passengers but the complexities, opportunities, and risks associated with cars make the upgrade far more than a \"technology refresh.\"  The biggest single problem with IPv6 is network administrators are not familiar with it.  24 years after IP was presented in  there are still people who do not understand the networks for which they are responsible.  IPv6 is going to confuse this situation by an order of magnitude.  Training is the only way to have a chance to successfully implement IPv6.  Unfortunately, OMB is  but not providing resources to get administrators trained to handle these new protocols.  I expect a wave of new intrusions during and after the transition to IPv6.  Not only with the IPv6 network stacks will be directly exploited, but common misconfigurations will plague enterprises for years.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Last night I attended a talk at my local .  Mr Jarzombek began his talk by pointing out the proposed  creates an Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Telecommunications working for the .  This is supposed to be an improvement over the previous job held by , where he lead the National Cyber Security Division, under the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate.  According to , \"Yoran had reported to Robert P. Liscouski, assistant secretary for infrastructure protection, and was not responsible for telecommunication networks, which are the backbone of the Internet.\"  Mr Jarzombek said that people who are not Assistant Secretaries are \"not invited to the table\" on serious matters.Turning to the main points of his presentation, Mr Jarzombek said the government worries about \"subversions of the software supply chain\" by developers who are not \"exercising a minimum level of responsible practice.\"  He claimed that \"business intelligence is being acquired because companies are not aware of their supply chains.\"  The government wants to \"strengthen operational resiliency\" by \"building trust into the software acquired and used by the government and critical infrastructure.\"  To that end, software assurance is supposed to incorporate \"trustworthiness, predictable execution, and conformance.\"  Mr Jarzombek wants developers to \"stop making avoidable mistakes.\"  He also wants those operating critical infrastructure to realize that \"if software is not secure, it's not safe.  If software can be changed remotely by an intruder, it's not reliable.\"  Apparently infrastructure provides think in terms of safety and reliability, but believe security is \"someone else's problem.\"I applaud Mr Jarzombek's work in this area, but I think the problem set is too difficult.  For example, the government appears to worry about two separate problems.  First they are concerned that poor programming practices will introduce vulnerabilities.  To address this issue Mr Jarzombek and associates promote a huge variety of standards that are supposed to \"raise the bar\" for software development.  To me this sounds like the argument for certification and accreditation (C&A).  Millions of dollars and thousands of hours are spent on C&A, and C&A levels are used to assess security.  In reality C&A is a 20-year-old paperwork exercise that does not yield improved security.  The only real way to measure security is to track the numbers and types of compromise over time, and try to see that number decrease.  Second, the government is worried about rogue developers (often overseas and outsourced) introducing back doors into critical code.  No amount of paperwork is going to stop this group.  Whatever DHS and friends produces will be widely distributed in the hopes of encouraging its adoption.  This means rogue developers can code around the checks performed by DHS diagnostic software.  Even if given the entire source code to a project, skilled rogue developers can obfuscate their additions.In my opinion the government spends way too much time on the vulnerability aspect of the risk equation.  Remember risk = threat X vulnerability X asset/impact/cost/etc.  Instead of devoting so much effort to vulnerabilities, I think the government should divert resources to deterring and prosecuting threats.  Consider the \"defense\" of a city from thieves.  Do city officials devote huge amounts of resources to shoring up doors, windows, locks, and so forth on citizen homes?  That problem is too large, and thieves would find other ways to steal anyway.  Instead, police deter crime when possible and catch thieves who do manage to steal property.  Of course \"proactive\" measures to prevent crime are preferred, so the police work with property owners to make improvements to homes and businesses where possible.  I asked Mr Jarzombek a question along these lines.  He essentially said the threat problem is too difficult to address, so the government concentrates on vulnerabilities.  That's not much of an answer, since his approach has to defend all of the nation's targets.  My threat-based approach focuses on deterring and capturing the much smaller groups of real threats.  Mr Jarzombek then said that the government does pursue threats, but he \"can't talk about that.\"  Why not?  I understand he and others can't reveal operational details, but why not say \"Federal, state and local law enforcement are watching carefully and we will have zero tolerance for these kinds of crimes.\"  Someone actually said those words, but not about attacking infrastructure.  These words were spoken by Alberto Gonzales, US Attorney General, with respect to Katrina phishers.This approach would have more effect against domestic intruders, since foreign governments would not be scared by threat of prosecution.  However, if foreign groups knew we would pursue them with means other than law enforcement, we might be able to deter some of their activities.  At the very least we could devote more resources to intelligence and infiltration, thereby learning about groups attacking infrastructure and preventing damaging attacks.Since I'm discussing software assurance, I found a few interesting sites hosted by .  The  looks very cool.  The  is a newsletter, which among other features includes a \"Who's Winning in the Press?\" count of \"good guy\" and \"bad guy\" citations.

Having spent several minutes composing this response, I figured others might want to see what I teach.Day one is all network security monitoring.  This day is mainly based on material in .  We start with a case study and then a theory section to provide background.  I follow by discussing techniques to access wired and wireless traffic.  That's about half of day one.  The second half introduces four sections on tools to collect and analyze statistical, session, hybrid, and full content data.  All of these sections conclude with hands-on labs using equipment I provide.  By the end of day one students should know what network data to collect, how to access it, and what tools to capture and analyze it.Day two is all network incident response.  This day is based on material I wrote for .  I start with a case study and then background theory.  I combine the techniques and tools during this day, since the tools for network IR aren't as discrete as those for generic monitoring.  I provide sections on incident detection, containment, and resolution.  We discuss ways to limit an intruder's freedom of maneuver, how to perform first, live, and general response, and then how to reconfigure the network to reject the intruder.  Again, each section is backed up by labs.   By the end of day two students should know how to identify intrusions, what steps to take immediately thereafter, and how to win against a determined intruder.Day three is all network forensics.  This day is based on material I wrote for . Network forensics is an expansion of the tools introduced in day one as applied during the steps in day two.  I teach students how to collect, preserve, analyze, and present network traffic to support \"patch and proceed\" or \"pursue and prosecute\" actions.  This day seriously focuses on network analysis, but I ensure students know how to take the proper steps to turn collected packets into real network-based evidence.  By the end of day three students should know how to use network-based evidence to complement host-based evidence during incident response.Day four is all labs -- live fire exercises, you might say.  Students use new traffic not contained in days one, two, or three, and they work intrusions from detection through remediation and beyond.  The labs in days one, two, and three are designed to introduce students to key techniques and tools.  The labs in day four are designed to build confidence and familiarity so the lessons learned are immediately applicable outside the class.  I want students to leave day four believing they can use this knowledge to prevent, detect, and investigation real intrusions.If you have any questions, please contact me via richard at taosecurity dot com.

I thought I would publish Vika's thoughts in the hopes that she could provide an example of how one becomes a serious security practitioner.  Richard (R): What is your experience with security, and what are your interests?Vika (V): I am starting my second year as a  Ph. D. student at   (RSG). Everybody in the group works on various computer  security areas and my current focus is web application security.   Even though now security is a part of my everyday life, I am still  pretty new to this area. As an undergraduate student at UCSB I  learned some security basics, however, my real introduction to  practical security, and hacking in particular, was last fall when I  took \"Network Security and Intrusion Detection,\" which is a class  taught by my graduate advisor Prof. Giovanni Vigna.In this class I  learned various techniques that can be used to break the security of  computer systems, how to detect attacks, and how to protect a system  against possible attacks. Most importantly, as a part of the  classwork, every student was able to apply the learned techniques to  write actual exploits to attack various vulnerabilities in real  programs within a testbed network. Also, during the class, I  participated in two Capture The Flag (CTF) exercises (which are  organized every year by Prof. Vigna) where, together with other  students in the class, I could practice attacking other systems as  well as defending my team's system. As a result, after that class, I  had the background necessary to further develop my hacking skills on  my own as well as be able to work on various security problems. Later  I was very lucky to be involved in setting up the  which was organized by Prof. Vigna on June 10th, 2005. This  provided me with a valuable experience being on the organizers' side  and helped me to improve my system administration, networking, and  network traffic analysis skills.R: How did you join team Shellphish?V: Hmmm, I did not really join the team ... Everybody in the RSG is a  member of the Shellphish team :-).R: Did you have a specific role on the team?  If yes, can you describe it?V: During the DefCon CTF I was a \"human IDS.\" I was analyzing (using scripts and manually) network traffic in real time looking for  attacks on our system. This helped the team to discover many  successful attacks on our system, find out which particular  vulnerabilities were exploited, patch the system, and even reuse some  of the attacks against the other teams.[Note: Against sophisticated intruders, only human analysts can prevail.]R: What was it like to compete at Def Con?  Did it meet your  expectations?V: I was dreaming about competing at DefCon the whole year and it  certainly met my best expectations! :-) I don't have enough words to  describe the feeling that I had sitting 3 days straight in front of  the computer when I was absolutely consumed by the game. That is  something everybody should experience for him/herself ;-). I was very  lucky to be a part of such an amazing team, to work together with the  people whom I highly respect and from whom I have so many things to  learn. What can be better? When we came to DefCon this year, we did  not care that much about winning, we simply wanted to enjoy ourselves  doing the things that everybody in the team is fascinated with. And, it certainly worked out perfectly!R: Do you plan to compete next year?V: Of course.R: What advice could you give to those who might like to compete, or have skills like yours?V: Well, I am probably not the best person to give advices right now  because I am still have a long way to go myself, but if you  ask ;-) ... Knowing theory is not enough, you need to practice  everything that you read about hacking or security (I don't mean  attacking real systems, of course ;-). There are many ways to do it,  for example, install known vulnerable software on your own machine  and write an exploit for it. Also, even if you don't think that you  have enough skills to actually compete at Defcon, sign up for the  quals anyway and try it for yourself. From my own experience, I can  say that I learned many practical things from this year quals, not to mention that it was incredibly fun :-). Also, what I am planning on working now is to improve my scripting skills which are very important when competing in real time.Thanks to Vika for responding to my questions.If you like these sorts of interviews, let me know.

Nathan Thornbourgh's story in Time, , examines Titan Rain, a so-called \"cyberespionage ring\" first mentioned by Bradley Graham in last week's .  The Time story centers on Shawn Carpenter, an  security analyst.  The story says:\"As he had almost every night for the previous four months, he worked at his secret volunteer job until dawn, not as Shawn Carpenter, mid-level analyst, but as Spiderman\u2014the apt nickname his military-intelligence handlers gave him\u2014tirelessly pursuing a group of suspected Chinese cyberspies all over the world. Inside the machines, on a mission he believed the U.S. government supported, he clung unseen to the walls of their chat rooms and servers, secretly recording every move the snoopers made, passing the information to the Army and later to the FBI.The hackers he was stalking, part of a cyberespionage ring that federal investigators code-named Titan Rain, first caught Carpenter's eye a year earlier when he helped investigate a network break-in at Lockheed Martin in September 2003. A strikingly similar attack hit Sandia several months later, but it wasn't until Carpenter compared notes with a counterpart in Army cyberintelligence that he suspected the scope of the threat. Methodical and voracious, these hackers wanted all the files they could find, and they were getting them by penetrating secure computer networks at the country's most sensitive military bases, defense contractors and aerospace companies.\"I read this and thought, \"Whoa, this guy is saying too much.  Game over for him.\"  Then I read this:\"[T]he Army passed Carpenter and his late-night operation to the FBI. He says he was a confidential informant for the FBI for the next five months. Reports from his cybersurveillance eventually reached the highest levels of the bureau's counterintelligence division, which says his work was folded into an existing task force on the attacks. But his FBI connection didn't help when his employers at Sandia found out what he was doing. They fired him and stripped him of his Q clearance, the Department of Energy equivalent of top-secret clearance. Carpenter's after-hours sleuthing, they said, was an inappropriate use of confidential information he had gathered at his day job. Under U.S. law, it is illegal for Americans to hack into foreign computers.Carpenter is speaking out about his case, he says, not just because he feels personally maligned\u2014although he filed suit in New Mexico last week for defamation and wrongful termination. The FBI has acknowledged working with him: evidence collected by TIME shows that FBI agents repeatedly assured him he was providing important information to them. Less clear is whether he was sleuthing with the tacit consent of the government or operating as a rogue hacker. At the same time, the bureau was also investigating his actions before ultimately deciding not to prosecute him.\"Now I understand why Time has all these details!I would like more technical clarification of this point:\"When he uncovered the Titan Rain routers in Guangdong, he carefully installed a homemade bugging code in the primary router's software. It sent him an e-mail alert at an anonymous Yahoo! account every time the gang made a move on the Net. Within two weeks, his Yahoo! account was filled with almost 23,000 messages, one for each connection the Titan Rain router made in its quest for files.\"What does this mean?  It sounds like Carpenter took control of the routers and then, what?I cite this story because it talks about how sophisticated threats operate:\"Carpenter had never seen hackers work so quickly, with such a sense of purpose. They would commandeer a hidden section of a hard drive, zip up as many files as possible and immediately transmit the data to way stations in South Korea, Hong Kong or Taiwan before sending them to mainland China. They always made a silent escape, wiping their electronic fingerprints clean and leaving behind an almost undetectable beacon allowing them to re-enter the machine at will. An entire attack took 10 to 30 minutes.\"That's how professionals work.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

This document, titled Engineering Principles for Information Technology Security (A Baseline for Achieving Security), is almost exactly what a so-called \"security professional\" should know.  The document presents 33 \"IT Security Principles,\" divided into 6 categories.  These principles represent sound security theories.  For future reference and to facilitate discussion, here are those 33 principles.Security FoundationPrinciple 1. Establish a sound security policy as the \u201cfoundation\u201d for designPrinciple 2. Treat security as an integral part of the overall system design.Principle 3. Clearly delineate the physical and logical security boundaries governed by associated security policies.Principle 4. Ensure that developers are trained in how to develop secure software.Risk Based Principle 5. Reduce risk to an acceptable level. [Note: It does not say \"eliminate risk;\" smart.]Principle 6. Assume that external systems are insecure. [\"External\" here means systems not under your control.]Principle 7. Identify potential trade-offs between reducing risk and increased costs and decrease in other aspects of operational effectiveness. [The wording is poor. The idea is to identify situations where information owners decide to accept risks in order to satisfy other operational requirements.]Principle 8.  Implement tailored system security measures to meet organizational security goals.Principle 9. Protect information while being processed, in transit, and in storage.Principle 10. Consider custom products to achieve adequate security.Principle 11. Protect against all likely classes of \"attacks.\"Ease of Use Principle 12. Where possible, base security on open standards for portability and interoperability.Principle 13. Use common language in developing security requirements. [In other words, definitions matter.]Principle 14. Design security to allow for regular adoption of new technology,including a secure and logical technology upgrade process.Principle 15. Strive for operational ease of use.Increase Resilience Principle 16. Implement layered security (Ensure no single point of vulerability).Principle 17. Design and operate an IT system to limit damage and to be resilient in response.Principle 18. Provide assurance that the system is, and continues to be, resilient in the face of expected threats.Principle 19. Limit or contain vulnerabilities.Principle 20. Isolate public access systems from mission critical resources (e.g., data, processes, etc.).Principle 21. Use boundary mechanisms to separate computing systems and network infrastructures.Principle 22. Design and implement audit mechanisms to detect unauthorized use and to support incident investigations. [In other words, from the network side, this means network security monitoring.]Principle 23. Develop and exercise contingency or disaster recovery proceduresto ensure appropriate availability.Reduce VulnerabilitiesPrinciple 24. Strive for simplicity.Principle 25. Minimize the system elements to be trusted.Principle 26. Implement least privilege. [Note: The text also recommends \"separation of duties.\"Principle 27. Do not implement unnecessary security mechanisms.Principle 28. Ensure proper security in the shutdown or disposal of a system.Principle 29. Identify and prevent common errors and vulnerabilities.Design with Network in MindPrinciple 30. Implement security through a combination of measures distributedphysically and logically. Principle 31. Formulate security measures to address multiple overlapping information domains. Principle 32. Authenticate users and processes to ensure appropriate access control decisions both within and across domains.Principle 33. Use unique identities to ensure accountability.Given these principles, the next step is to devise practices or techniques for each.  For example, Principle 26 states \"Implement least privilege.\"  Practices or techniques include (but are not limited to) the following, which represent my own thoughts; NIST does not reach to this level:Create groups which provide functions needed to meet an operational requirement.Operate mechanisms which allow temporary privilege escalation to accomplish specific tasks.Assign systems administrators the primary task of administering systems.  Assign security operators the primary task of auditing system use.I recommend the exam not delve deeper into specific implementations or tools.  One could imagine what those would be, however.  Here are examples from FreeBSD; again, these are my thoughts:Use the Use Configure system logging though .I do not think an exam like the CISSP should delve as deep as implementations or tools.  Staying at the levels of theory/principle and techniques/practices is vendor-neutral, more manageable, and less likely to become obsolete as technologies change.While I may not be happy with all of NIST's principles, they are much more representative of what the CISSP should address.  As a bonus, this NIST publication already exists, and the sorts of people who haggle over principles like these tend to gravitate toward documentation from .gov institutions.  Furthermore, one of the better CISSP exam prep guides references the older version of SP 800-27: , by  Ronald L. Krutz and Russell Dean Vines.  In fact, the exact chapter mentioning 800-27 principles (albeit the 2001 versions) is A Google search of  only yields 48 hits, meaning not too many people are making the link.

Healthy birds are the asset we wish to protect.The threat is wild migratory birds infected by bird flu.The threat uses an exploit, namely bird flu itself.The vulnerability possessed by the asset and exploited by the threat is lack of immunity to bird flu.A countermeasure to reduce the asset's exposure to the threat is keeping protected birds indoors, away from their wild counterparts.The risk is infection of domesticated birds by wild birds.  All infected birds must be killed.The TV story I watched contained this quote by reported Tom Heap:\"The lesson learned from foot-and-mouth [disease, which ravaged Europe several years ago] is to do your best to keep the disease out, but assume that will fail.

The class consists of four days, covering network security monitoring, network incident response, and network forensics.  Days one, two, and three each offer small labs at regular intervals to reinforce the lecture material.  Day four is entirely lab-based.One of my goals is to give each student his or her own environment for analysis.  I am considering a mix of real, I don't intend to provide each student his or her own laptop.  I prefer each student to bring a laptop to the class, and SSH from the laptop to his or her own environment.  Alternatively, if VMWare GSX is used on the class server, the student could connect using the VMWare Virtual Console.  That requires adding code to the student's own laptop (which needs to be running Linux or Windows), which I would prefer to avoid.Another option involves building a custom live CD, perhaps using I have been trying to imagine the sorts of activities I would want to try in a class covering these topics.  I want students to try a wide variety of network analysis tools, like Tcpdump, Tethereal, Snort, Tcpflow, Ngrep, Flowgrep, Flow-tools, Argus, Tcpdstat, Capinfos, and so on.  These can be implemented (especially when reading from saved Libpcap traces) fairly simply.If I want to provide a more exotic environment, implementation becomes more difficult.  For example, I would like to let each student experiment with Sguil.  Should students be able to run tools that sniff live traffic in promiscuous mode?  I'm also considering a section that describes how to set up a caged server using Pf.  Implementing a bridging firewall setup to build a cage presents all sorts of issues.Perhaps analysis is more important.  In that case, deciphering network traffic might be the focus.  That is easier to implement than creating a dynamic network environment.  I am concerned that VMWare might not support an open (non-switched) network conducive to sniffing.I've set a limit of 15 students per class for my private classes.  However, when I teach at USENIX, I could have 30 or more students.  Although I do not teach an all-lab day at USENIX, my other classes (NSM, NIR, NF) could have hands-on components if I plan them to accommodate large groups.When I taught at Foundstone we provided every student his or her own Dell laptop, and the labs centered on students trying to break into laptop target ranges.  Eventually we replaced the laptop targets with VMs.So, what sorts of lab activities would you want to see in a class on NSM, NIR, and NF?  What have you seen other classes do, and what did you like?

Paul is an analyst at Gartner now, but years ago he wrote an excellent book -- , which I Paul's article introduces network anomaly detection systems, shorted by the wonderful acronym NADS.    Paul describes NADS thus:\"NADS are designed to analyze network traffic with data gathered from protocols like Cisco Systems's NetFlow, Juniper's cFlow or sources that support the sFlow standard. Data is correlated directly from packet analysis; and the systems use a combination of anomaly and signature detection to alert network and security managers of suspicious activity, and present a picture of network activity for analysis and response.\"I find Paul's opinions to be sound:\"Despite vendor claims to the contrary, NAD is primarily an investigative technology. While it has the potential to detect zero-day and other stealthy attacks, confidence in its results remains a problem in enabling automated response mechanisms. This isn't unlike the early versions of IDS/IPS products, which weren't reliable enough to enable automated responses. In this light, NAD is best used to detect, investigate and manually address suspected incidents and problems...NADS may not be able to automatically detect and block with the confidence of an IPS signature, but neither can an IDS/IPS help an organization if the enabled signature set misses something.\"I am glad to see someone defending a product for its investigative value and not for its preventative value.  It appears someone else realizes that prevention eventually fails, anyway.Paul also says:\"NAD devices are powerful knowledge tools for expert network operations people with enterprise-specific contextual knowledge. These systems can help enterprises learn about the traffic and behavior of their network.\"That's exactly right.  NADS improve network situational awareness.  However: \"Even though they can catch detailed events, such as a new service opening up, a new protocol appearing or a new machine connecting to the network, these events are too common to have value in larger enterprises. NADS shine where obvious behaviors \u2014 like when a worm-infected machine spewing attack traffic or a DoS attack \u2014 are under way.\"Here is the true root of the problem.  If one cannot define normal network behavior, perhaps due to the size of the network or an inherently dynamic nature, then a NADS won't be much help.  In those cases, it will only detect \"obvious behaviors,\" for which existing detection and prevention systems may be adequate.Paul concludes the article by recognizing the importance of skilled operators:\"The value these systems offer for addressing more subtle behavior is dependent upon the knowledge and experience of the operator. Under the right circumstances, NADS provide a wealth of network behavior information (protocols, ports, services, throughput, latency, etc.) that can be used to understand what's really going on in your network.\"This is another reason why network security analysts are not going to lose their jobs.  Networks are only becoming more complex.  There is no chance that an expert network or security administrator can be coded into a software appliance.  If IPv6 is widely deployed, the need for skilled operators will only grow.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

While the amount of attention universities pay to security has been rising in the past few years, it has mostly been to react to potential lawsuits do [sic] to illegal file sharing and the like - universities need to pay way more attention to how their own sys admins manage their own servers.\"I agree with John's assessment, except for the last phrase that implies university sys admins \"need to pay way more attention\" to security.  From my own view of the world, a lot of university system administrators read TaoSecurity Blog, attend my The  newsletter features a letter to the editor signed by eleven .edu security analysts.  They take exception with Mr. Pescatore's comments.  SANS is requesting comments on that letter.  Here is my take on a few excerpts.The letter states:\"Many of these schools are complex and most security implementations typically used at a corporate or government level don't fit a university model because a broader range of network activities is permitted on university networks, in large part due to a much more limited set of policies and controls compared to government and commercial entities.\"The \"broader range of network activities\" is part of the problem.  Most .edu networks apply very little inbound access control and hardly any outbound access control. (Sometimes that is reversed; one .edu I worked with implemented zero inbound control and single outbound control denying TFTP!) Do .edu networks think the corporate world does not support a wide variety of protocols and services? I recently finished a  for a client. I was surprised to see the number of protocols in use that I did not immediately recognize. This is no different from a .edu, except the .com had taken steps to restrict use of those protocols and services to defined partners. \"I can't define who will access my data,\" a .edu might reply.  If that is the case, the .edu has decided that anyone in the world can access potentially sensitive data.  (See the section below on the \"tenth planet\" to read consequences of that stance.)  In reality, the .edu is saying \"it's too difficult\" to define who should access data.  That's a cop-out.The \"limited set of policies and controls\" is not the fault of the administrators.  It is the fault of management who refuse to reign in professors, or to force them to accept responsibility for operating insecure systems.  If a professor is a prolific researcher, he or she is often given a \"pass\" to run whatever infrastructure he or she needs for research purposes.  While research is obviously important, the professors and staff should realize that lack of security jeopardizes their research.  How would they feel to know that a team of competing researchers, or even corporate spies, were stealing the next breakthrough in gene therapy from research systems?We already The letter continues:\"Many times, the tools to secure these environments don't exist and changing the culture in these heterogeneous environments to one which promotes secure computing is very difficult.\"Actually, all of the tools to secure a .edu exist.  Almost all of them exist in open source form, too.  Ten years ago this might not have been the case, but today one can employ open source countermeasures that in some cases exceed their commercial counterparts.  The array of network-centric security capabilities offered by The tools exist, but the managerial will to implement them does not.The letter continues:\"Our overall approach to our networking is about promoting research and information sharing and our security architecture needs to take that into account. Many schools uphold the concept of the 'End-to-End' nature of the original Internet for both research and communication of ideas. These ideas on full connectivity have merit and cannot be dismissed because the nature of faculty research or inter-university collaboration might rely on unfettered access to the Internet. The concept of a DMZ is not feasible for many schools compared to many in government and business which cannot live without one.\"Immense multi-national organizations foster information sharing and research.  While they admittedly are not perfect, many enterprises manage to maintain better security than .edu's.  The \"end-to-end\" Internet is a myth that to which too many people cling.  That model may have worked when the Internet was a private network, but \"end-to-end\" today places no barriers between your system and anyone else in the world with an IP address.  The majority of hosts are not designed, configured, or deployed in a self-defending manner.  Hosts that cannot protect themselves must be supported by additional security resources.  Even if a system could be operated indepedently (e.g., an OpenBSD server), without any network-based access control, this is not a tenable defensive model.  The .edu world needs to understand that defense-in-depth is one of the best ways to compensate for weak host software, potential misconfiguration, and aggressive intruders.Finally, \"the concept of a DMZ\" is not feasible for many organizations, not just .edu's.  Security zones, which group hosts of similar security requirements, are now the best way to offer network-centric access control and monitoring.What are your thoughts?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

If you have Ethernet to your ISP, you could place the tap in front of your border router.  This scenario would provide visibility to traffic addressed to the Internet-facing interface of your border router.  You could monitor for attacks against the router without having to tap a T1 or DS3 connection.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "This is not a Microsoft issue, but I learned of it through a  feature called  by .  He claims to have written about this subject in his book , but he believes the issue merits greater attention.  Cutting past the introduction to 802.1X, Steve writes:\"[T]here\u2019s a fundamental flaw in wired, 802.1X that seriously reduces its effectiveness at keeping out rogue machines...[I]t authenticates only at the establishment of a connection. Once a supplicant authenticates and the switch port opens, further communications between the supplicant and the switch aren\u2019t authenticated. This creates a situation in which it\u2019s possible for an attacker to join the network. (Thanks to , Microsoft MVP for security, for showing me this vulnerability.)Setting up the attack does require physical access to the network. An attacker needs to disconnect a computer (let\u2019s call this the \u201cvictim\u201d) from its 802.1X-protected network switch port, connect a hub to the port, connect the victim to the hub, and connect an attack computer (which we\u2019ll call the \u201cshadow\u201d) to the hub. This is trivially easy if the attacker is physically inside your facility and if your Ethernet jacks are accessible. Or the attacker could connect an unmanaged access point to the hub and then conduct the attack from your parking lot. (Of course, the attacker could try to hide by disabling this AP\u2019s SSI broadcast.)The brief disconnection of the victim from the network won\u2019t interfere with the attack\u2019s success. When the victim computer is reconnected, it authenticates to the switch again. It doesn\u2019t matter that a hub is in the way now, because a hub is little more than a wire with ports in it. Electrically, the victim is still connected to the switch.Next the attacker configures the shadow computer\u2019s MAC and IP addresses to be the same as those on the victim computer. A little network sniffing will quickly reveal this. The attacker also configures a host firewall to drop all inbound traffic that isn\u2019t a reply to communications that it initiated.Now, here\u2019s why 802.1X on a wired network really is insufficient. After the victim computer has authenticated and the switch port is open, the attacker can connect to resources on the protected network. This is because there is no per-packet authentication of the traffic once the port is open. Since the shadow computer has the same MAC and IP addresses as the victim computer, from the point of view of the switch it appears only as if there\u2019s a single computer connected to the port. 802.1X\u2019s lack of follow-on per-packet authentication creates the situation for this man-in-the-middle attack I\u2019ve just described. 802.1X only authenticates the connection; it assumes all traffic that\u2019s flowing over the connection is legitimate. This assumption is 802.1X\u2019s fundamental flaw.\"Steve then addresses what happens when two computers try to use the same IP and MAC address while connected to the switch.  If the \"shadow\" PC sends a SYN to a remote system, both victim and shadow PCs will see a SYN-ACK reply.  The victim PC should reply with a RST (not RST ACK) because it won't be expecting an unsolicited SYN-ACK.  Steve makes an interesting point, though:\"If the victim computer is running a firewall that drops unsolicited inbound SYN-ACKs, which most do, the victim won\u2019t process the received SYN-ACK in step 2 and therefore won\u2019t send the RST to the server. The rest of the above sequence won\u2019t happen and the shadow computer can have complete access to the protected network. This is the only instance I know of where a personal firewall on a computer can reduce the security of the rest of the network! Of course this is no reason not to deploy personal firewalls; their benefits strongly outweigh the likelihood of this attack actually happening.\"I noticed Steve says the remote server, upon receiving a RST from the victim PC, will reply with \"a RST-ACK (acknowledging the received RST and sending its own), which both the shadow and the victim receive.\"This should not be the case.   says a RST should not be sent in response to a RST.  I don't know if Steve tested this in his own lab, since his description seems to mimic the page by  he mentions.The bottom line appears to be that using 802.1X is a bad idea if an intruder has physical access to a port where a legitimate system is connected.  802.1X on wireless networks in not susceptible to this problem.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Excerpts from this \"Sydney [Australia] magistrate Lawrence Lawson threw out a speeding case after the RTA [Roads and Traffic Authority] said it had no evidence that an image from a camera had not been doctored.Mr Lawson had adjourned the case in June, giving the RTA eight weeks to produce an expert to prove pictures from a speed camera on Carlingford Rd, Epping, had not been altered after they were taken.But RTA lawyers yesterday told Hornsby Local Court they could not find an expert and the case was thrown out...The case revolved around the integrity of a mathematical MD5 algorithm published on each picture and used as a security measure to prove pictures have not been doctored after they have been taken.Mr Miralis argued that the RTA had to prove the algorithm it used was accurate and could not be tampered with.\"Good grief.  The prosecution in the case appears to have lost because they framed the issues incorrectly.  If the battleground was the lack of collisions in MD5, of course the RTA would lose.

        "content": "Recently a friend asked me if I knew of anyone with a security clearance who has also passed a polygraph.  It seems some agency (unknown to me) requires individuals with digital security assessment experience and the designated level of security clearances.  I told my friend I did not know of anyone with that combination.  He replied that the agency in question was ready to simply find someone with the necessary clearances, and teach them whatever skills were needed to perform the security assessment.Something about this bothered me.  I realized that this unknown agency was more concerned with the supposed trustworthiness of the assessor than with the skills he or she would apply to the agency's digital security interests.  In other words, this agency valued a cleared yet unskilled person over a skilled yet uncleared person.  In my opinion, that calculation defeats the purpose of the security clearance.  Let's examine why.A security clearance is designed to be a preventative measure that guards against a specific threat: rogue insiders.  One of the most dangerous adversaries is someone on the inside, trusted with access to sensitive networks and data.  It is important to ensure that people in such positions are worthy of the trust granted to them.A security assessment is designed as another preventative measure.  A security assessment enumerates vulnerabilities so they can be remediated or mitigated.  These are the sorts of vulnerabilities one could expect an outsider, or more seriously, an insider, to try to exploit.  We have a situation where an unknown agency is willing to hire someone without the necessary skills to perform a very important task.  That task is discovering vulnerabilities and recommending answers.  This is not a job for a newbie, even if that newbie is \"trusted.\"  By putting itself in this situation, the agency has calculated that it values employing supposedly trusted newbie assessors over the act of discovering and fixing security holes.  Good vulnerability assessors or penetration testers are not born in boot camps.  Discovering, validating, and remediating vulnerabilities requires more than knowing how to run Nessus or Metasploit.  I doubt someone who has just learned to perform an assessment will deliver the report truly needed by this agency.  The \"work\" by a brand-new \"assessor\" has just turned into a compliance item; the box has been checked, but who cares about the result?This brings me to the broader question of clearances.  What other trade-offs have been made in the interest of \"trustworthiness,\" and at the expense of \"security\"?  I know of people who could have made significant contributions to various projects, but had to wait months or years waiting for the appropriate security clearances.  What damage was done, what missions were lost, what opportunies foresaken while the clearance process was followed?  For other economics-trained readers, what is the opportunity cost of security clearances?I read articles about problems with the , and these are the questions I do not see addressed.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

She is now Mike Lynn's attorney, and she is posting her side of the story at her blog, .  As of this morning there are three parts available.  Here are interesting excerpts from each.:\"His presentation did not give away exploit code, or even enough information for listeners to readily create exploit code. In fact, he said, Cisco employees who had vetted the information were themselves unable to create and exploit from his information. But Mike wanted to show people that (1) he knew what he was talking about and (2) he could do what he said could be done. He included just enough information to make those points. (Following the talk, other researchers who\u2019d seen it agreed that it would take a lot of work to get from Mike\u2019s presentation to an exploit.)\"\"I was asking what exactly he was claiming that Lynn had done wrong. It appeared to be three things. First, ISS was claiming copyright in the presentation that Mike had given on Wednesday morning (Wednesday presentation). Second, Cisco was claiming copyright in the decompiled machine code that Mike obtained from the Cisco binaries and had included in his slides. And finally, Cisco was claiming trade secret in the information Mike had obtained by decompiling and studying Cisco source code.\":\"The more interesting claim was the trade secret claim. They were suing under California\u2019s trade secret law. California has adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which is relatively broad. It prohibits the misappropriation of trade secrets...So the first question is, \u201cwhat\u2019s the secret?\u201d The complaint says that Lynn had Cisco source code, but he didn\u2019t. He had the binary code. The binary isn\u2019t secret, since Cisco sells it. Is the decompiled code secret? Is it the fact that there\u2019s a vulnerability? Would the law allow a product flaw to be a protected trade secret? ...I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything here of Cisco\u2019s that the law would protect.The second question is, even if there is some kind of trade secret, did Mike misappropriate it. Misappropriation means acquisition by improper means, or disclosure without consent by a person who used improper means to acquire the knowledge. The law specifically says that reverse engineering (decompiling) is proper, not improper, means...It seemed that Cisco was claiming that Mike\u2019s actions were improper because he violated the End User License Agreement (EULAs), which prohibited reverse engineering...Lynn\u2019s case presented the question of whether EULAs could subvert the legislature\u2019s express desire to allow people to reverse engineer trade secrets...[M]y best legal argument was that violation of an End User License Agreement is not a trade secret violation. Improper means includes a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy. But the EULA did not impose a duty to maintain secrecy. It was merely a promise not to reverse engineer. A violation of that promise is a violation of contract, but not an improper means of discovering a trade secret.There was the possibility that Mike had information that was secret as to ISS and that he had promised to keep secret under his employment agreement or NDA. But the complaint didn\u2019t identify any ISS trade secrets and Mike hadn\u2019t disclosed any ISS information other than whatever was in the presentation, so this was a great legal argument.\":\"A friend told me that that there were two FBI agents looking for me and asking questions about Mike\u2019s presentation. They were wandering around the floor of the Black Hat conference, wearing suits and couldn\u2019t be missed. He told me that the agents said they \u201cjust wanted to talk\u201d to people. \u201cTalk? F*ck that,\u201d I advised. Always judicious when dealing with law enforcement, I excused myself from my family meal, and ran back to the convention center to see what was going on.To be continued...\"Update:  Here is .Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

It is impossible to execute shell code on Cisco IOS.' At that point (ISS) management was annoyed.... They were like, 'Mike, your new research project is Cisco IOS. Go find out how to exploit bugs on Cisco IOS so we can prove these people wrong...'[Cisco] also sent out an engineer ... who described himself as an IOS architect.... I was told he helped design parts of the source code.... And his jaw hit the ground. He was very impressed, he was just (saying), 'Wow, that's cool.' That was June 14th.WN [Wired News]: Cisco saw your Black Hat presentation long before they decided to pull it. When did they see it?Lynn: Probably June 14th, the day that they came out (to Atlanta). We told them about the vulnerabilities well before (that)...[ISS] actually wanted to distribute the full working exploit very widely inside the company.... I was told ... 'Give this to all the sales engineers and to all the pen testers...'I told them, 'You do realize if you do that, it's going to leak?' And (one of the ISS guys) says, 'That's Cisco's problem.' And then (another ISS guy) turns to me and says that they need to understand this could be their ...At that point, I told them all no, and they fought it and I resigned right there on the spot. And this was about a month ago...[Wired News]: (ISS talked him out of the resignation by agreeing to give him control over who could see or have the exploit.) (Then) it was two weeks ago, I was first told that Cisco might want to come onto (the) stage with me and say a couple words. And I said, provided the words aren't something to the effect that 'he's a liar,' I'm OK with it.... [Wired News]: (However, the plan changed even more and Lynn was told to remove any mention of reverse engineering from his talk or cancel the presentation. If he did neither, he would be fired.)Mind you this is a complete reversal. Like a week or so prior, the night of the close of the fiscal quarter, and they were all celebrating that they hit the numbers, the [ISS] CEO invited me out for a beer, and he just couldn't say enough awesome things about this talk.WN: Was Cisco threatening them?Lynn: I asked point-blank, 'Are you being threatened by Cisco?' They said no.... To be perfectly honest, I don't think there was any legal threat. I think that it was more of a 'scratch our back and we'll scratch yours.'(Cisco asked him to wait a year until it could release a new version of its operating system. When he didn't back down, Cisco threatened a lawsuit against Lynn and Black Hat. Then with Black Hat's cooperation, Cisco arranged to tear out pages with images of Lynn's slides from the conference book.)\"There you go.  Now you see the operation of the respective \"market leaders\" in their fields: Cisco in networking and ISS in security.  Notice how the CEOs of both companies (ISS' Noonan and Cisco's Chambers)  are members of the .  This is how their companies practice \"responsibility\" in matters affecting national security.  One company (ISS) is ready to distribute devastating exploit code to make the competition look bad, while the other embarks on futile attempts to hide that fact that its products are broken.  This disturbs me greatly.  Why would anyone wonder why my first post was ?At least Mike will be involved in improving the country's security.

The packet must be sent from a local network segment. Only devices that have been explicitly configured to process IPv6 traffic are affected. Upon successful exploitation, the device may reload or be open to further exploitation.\"Assuming these details are correct -- and who knows now? -- this is not an earth-shattering discovery.

He may have picked this vulnerability because he thought it would not affect much of the Internet, but he needed to let people know that his technique was already in use by malicious parties.Cisco's main  addresses the Lynn affair directly as well.This  quotes Jeff Moss:\" Jeff Moss, president of Black Hat, predicted the ruling would have a dampening effect on security enthusiasts.People will say, Why would we tell the public about this if we're going to be sued?

You've just alienated anyone who would consider quietly approaching you with vulnerability details.  You've probably also stirred up an army of independent researchers who will look for new holes in IOS.The real tragedy is the vulnerability of all the enterprises running Cisco gear, to include all of my clients.  It's time for me to figure out better ways to monitor Cisco equipment for signs of compromise.

'There may never be. But they got a complaint and as a result they were doing some investigation.'...Lynn said that if the case was not dropped, he thought it unlikely that the FBI would try to arrest him this weekend.'I think they got burned with the Dmitry Sklyarov case,' he said.\"Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

It was an extension of work he presented at .  His  and an Maybe Mike Lynn's mistake was working for a security company (ISS) and with a vendor (Cisco) and being a US citizen?  Nothing bad happened to FX before, during, of after his presentation.  Was FX's vulnerabilities considered too old to be a problem, but Mike's too recent?I've been poking around at the Cisco Web site, and I noticed that in April and May they began a massive removal of old IOS images.  This product bulletin 2863,  (.pdf) outlines the process, and this  (.pdf) answers questions on the clean-up.  While this could have been planned well before Mike Lynn notified Cisco of his discoveries, it's also possible Cisco took steps to remove vulnerable IOS images because of his findings.  Either way, removing old vulnerable images is an excellent idea.Update:  I found a few interesting NANOG posts by James Baldwin, who is in Las Vegas and .  According to Mr. Baldwin, \"\"  Lynn \" There were no illegal acts committed in gaining this information nor was any proprietary information provided for its development.\"    My [Baldwin's] understanding is that this has been fixed and no current IOS images were vulnerable to the techniques he was describing. ISS, Lynn, and Cisco had been working together for months on this issue before the talk.\"  Finally,  and duplicating the information would only provide you a method to increase the severity of other potential exploits. It does not create any new exploits. Moreover, the fix for this was already released and you have not been able to download a vulnerable version of the software for months however there was no indication from Cisco regarding the severity of the required upgrade. That is to say, they knew in April that arbitrary code execution was possible on routers, they had it fixed by May, and we're hearing about it now and if Cisco had its way we might still not be hearing about it.\"I guess that explains the IOS clean-up.  Lynn might have shown a way to develop exploits based on analyzing differences in IOS images.

Today while working on a FreeBSD system with multiple interfaces, I noticed the portmapper (rpcbind) listening where I didn't think it should be.# sockstat -4 | grep rpcbindroot     rpcbind    354   10 udp4   127.0.0.1:111         *:*root     rpcbind    354   11 udp4   10.0.0.1:111          *:*root     rpcbind    354   12 udp4   *:1007                *:*root     rpcbind    354   13 tcp4   *:111                 *:*The UDP version was listening on interface 10.0.0.1 as I expected.  What was the TCP version doing listening on all interfaces?  Also, what was port 1007 UDP doing?I checked my /etc/rc.conf file to see if I had messed up the synatx.rpcbind_enable=\"YES\"rpcbind_flags=\"-h 10.0.0.1\"That looked ok to me.  I double-checked with /etc/defaults/rc.conf.# grep \"^rpcbind\" /etc/defaults/rc.confrpcbind_enable=\"NO\"             # Run the portmapper service (YES/NO).rpcbind_program=\"/usr/sbin/rpcbind\"     # path to rpcbind, if you want a different one.rpcbind_flags=\"\"                # Flags to rpcbind (if enabled).I finally looked at the man page and clarified the -h switch.     -h      Specify specific IP addresses to bind to for UDP requests.  This             option may be specified multiple times and is typically necessary             when running on a multi-homed host.  If no -h option is speci-             fied, rpcbind will bind to INADDR_ANY, which could lead to prob-             lems on a multi-homed host due to rpcbind returning a UDP packet             from a different IP address than it was sent to.  Note that when             specifying IP addresses with -h, rpcbind will automatically add             127.0.0.1 and if IPv6 is enabled, ::1 to the list.OH NO.  It only mentions UDP and not TCP.  That's why I'm crushed.  One of the characteristics I like about FreeBSD (and Unix in general) is the granular control over services enabled via simple text files.  I should have been able to tell both UDP and TCP rpcbind versions to listen on a specified interface.  That doesn't seem possible.Now my only alternative is to firewall the interfaces where I do not want rpcbind to listen.

        "content": "Bill Brenner's article in the July 2005  magazine clued me in to a  by the  (CompTIA).  They announced the results of their third annual CompTIA Study on IT Security and the Workforce.  From the press release:\"Human error, either alone or in combination with a technical malfunction, was blamed for four out of every five IT security breaches (79.3 percent), the study found. That figure is not statistically different from last year.\"This study and the  appear to be the source for other reports that claim 80% of security breaches are the result of human error.  Note the CompTIA study says \"Human error, either alone or in combination with a technical malfunction,\" is to blame.Nevertheless, I am not surprised by this figure.  I rarely perform an incident response for an organization that is beaten by a zero day exploit in the hands of an uber 31337 h@x0r.  In most cases someone poorly configures a server, or doesn't patch it, or makes an honest mistake.  The fact is many IT systems are complicated, and none are getting simpler.  Administrators have too many responsibilities and too few resources.  They are often directed by managers who have decided to weigh \"business realities\" more important than security.  The enterprise is not running a defensible network architecture and the level of network awareness is marginal or nonexistent.  No network security or host integrity monitoring is done.  In such an environment, it is easy to see how a lapse in a firewall rule, a misapplied patch, or an incorrect application setting can provide the foothold a worm or attacker needs.So what is my answer?  No amount of preventative measures will ever stop all intrusions.  I recommend applying as much protection as your resources will allow, and then monitor everywhere you can.  If your monitoring doesn't help you identify a policy failure and/or intrusion, it will at least provide the evidence needed to remediate the problem, and then better prevent and/or detect the incident in the future.Update: I found this  press release that stated the following:\"In Infonetics Research\u2019s latest study, The Costs of Enterprise Downtime, North American Vertical Markets 2005, 230 companies with more than 1,000 employees each from five vertical markets\u2014finance, healthcare, transportation/logistics, manufacturing, and retail\u2014were surveyed about their network downtime...'The finance and manufacturing verticals are bleeding the most, with the average financial institution experiencing 1,180 hours of downtime per year, costing them 16% of their annual revenue, or $222 million, and manufacturers are losing an average of 9% of their annual revenue,' said Jeff Wilson, principal analyst of Infonetics Research and author of the study...Human error is the cause of at least a fifth of the downtime costs for all five verticals, and almost a third for financial institutions; this can only be fixed by adding and improving IT processes...Security downtime is not a major issue anywhere, though it reaches 8% of costs within financial organizations.\"Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Rather than post to his own 's  guide.  Uh oh, there's that magic word -- \"threat.\"  Immediately I suspected this document's use of the word \"threat\" in the title might be problematic, as I doubted it would be a classification of the parties with the capabilities and intentions to exploit vulnerabilities in assets.  The document description states \"The Web Security Threat Classification is a cooperative effort to clarify and organize the threats to the security of a web site. The members of the Web Application Security Consortium have created this project to develop and promote industry standard terminology for describing these issues. Application developers, security professionals, software vendors, and compliance auditors will have the ability to access a consistent language for web security related issues.\"That sounds to me like an open invitation for a debate on their language!Before you get too cross with me, note that I was pleasantly surprised to see most of the content correctly framed as \"attacks.\"  Other content was not labelled correctly.  Here are a few examples, which I will let you assess before I suggest an alternative way of looking at these issues.A Brute Force attack is an automated process of trial and error used to guess a person's username, password, credit-card number or cryptographic key.Insufficient Authentication occurs when a web site permits an attacker to access sensitive content or functionality without having to properly authenticate.Weak Password Recovery Validation is when a web site permits an attacker to illegally obtain, change or recover another user's password.Credential/Session Prediction is a method of hijacking or impersonating a web site user.Can you guess which terms are vulnerabilities, and which are attacks?  The attacks are easy; they are 1 and 4.  The document authors correctly call number 1 an \"attack\" in its description.  The vulnerabilities are items 2 and 3.  These are easy to spot, too.  The document authors didn't want to call these conditions vulnerabilities, so they bailed out by using the phrases \"occurs when\" and \"is when\".  This is a sure sign that the term is not an attack, but is something else.  Here are the other vulnerabilities in the document, listed as \"attacks\":Insufficient Authorization is when a web site permits access to sensitive content or functionality that should require increased access control restrictions.Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.Automatic directory listing/indexing is a web server function that lists all of the files within a requested directory if the normal base file is not present.Information Leakage is when a web site reveals sensitive data, such as developer comments or error messages, which may aid an attacker in exploiting the system.Insufficient Anti-automation is when a web site permits an attacker to automate a process that should only be performed manually.Insufficient Process Validation is when a web site permits an attacker to bypass or circumvent the intended flow control of an application.So, that's a great list.  Add those six items and the earlier two and you have eight total vulnerabilities.  At this point I would recommend breaking the document into two sections: (1) Vulnerabilities and (2) Attacks.  The document itself should be renamed the Web Vulnerability and Attack Classification Guide.  If you think for a moment you can even pair attacks properly labelled in the document with the relabelled vulnerabilities above.  Consider item two in this second list -- Insufficient Session Expiration.  Its extended description says\"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization. Insufficient Session Expiration increases a web site's exposure to attacks that steal or impersonate other users.\"Notice the term \"exposure\"?  That's a vulnerability that can be exploited by the following attacks listed in the guide:Session Fixation is an attack technique that forces a user's session ID to an explicit value. [me: like old session credentials?]Credential/Session Prediction is a method of hijacking or impersonating a web site user. [me: by predicting old session credentials?]Abuse of Functionality is an attack technique that uses a web site's own features and functionality to consume, defraud, or circumvents access controls mechanisms. [me: like  insufficient session expiration?]So there you go Aaron.  I've probably angered \"'The need for consistent technical terminology for web related security issues has a significant impact on risk assessment and remediation activities,' Pete Lindstrom, research director of Spire Security, said in a statement Monday. 'Establishing a standard approach for identifying these issues, along with a common terminology that everyone can adhere to, will help to thwart the increasing security risks associated with Web applications.'\"I would also say the Web Application Security Consortium's  (aka \"proxypot\") is an awesome idea.  Again, I have no issue with the technical work by these groups, as they far outweigh anything I have done in those fields.  However, I would be very happy to see industry-wide consistency in core security terms.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I don't run it on my servers!This is also funny:\"Why are you giving advance notice of the vulnerability information you've bought to other security vendors, including competitors?We are sharing with other security vendors in an effort to do the most good with the information we have acquired. We feel we can still maintain a competitive advantage with respect to our customers while facilitating the protection of a customer base larger than our own.What types of security vendors are eligible for the advanced notice?In order to qualify for advanced notice, the security vendors must be in a position to remediate or provide protection of vulnerabilities with their solution, while not revealing details of the vulnerability itself to customers. The security vendor's product must also be resistant to discovery of the vulnerability through trivial reverse engineering. An example of such a vendor would be an Intrusion Prevention System, Intrusion Detection System, Vulnerability Scanner or Vulnerability Management System vendor.\"I am eager to see what vendors can live up to these requirements.  Snort rules won't, and neither will Nessus NASL scripts.  I am uneasy about programs like this.  Consider modifying Mr. Endler's statement in this manner:\"We want to reward and encourage independent security research, promote and ensure responsible creation of viruses and provide our customers with the world's best security protection.\"A virus is malware launched by a threat; it's not a vulnerability.  Publication of a vulnerability does not explicitly mean publication of new code to be used by threats.  Still, it's not that difficult to move from vulnerability disclosure to exploit creation.TippingPoint is basically paying researchers to justify the vendor's existence.  No vulnerabilities = no need to buy a TippingPoint IPS.  More vulnerabilities means more opportunities for threats to craft exploit code, and that justifies buying more IPSs.How is this different from the  program, you might ask?  When Mozilla pays researchers to report vulnerabilities in Mozilla code, Mozilla is effectively outsourcing its security quality assurance program.  This is done to improve the quality of the software released by Mozilla.  When TippingPoint pays researchers to report vulnerabilities in anyone's software, and then keeps those vulnerabilities to itself (followed by limited disclosure), TippingPoint is justifying its product's existence.You might also wonder what I think of Microsoft's  to those who expose .  I have no problems with such a program, and I see it as another way to remove threats from the streets.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

The podcast lasts about 26 minutes and discusses Ron's experience as a NSA red team aggressor and his work at BBN.  I specifically liked Ron's discussion of the difference between access control and monitoring.  He said making a firewall change affects customer service level agreements; hence, firewalls were part of operations as they had direct impact on moving packets.  Monitoring was typically not an operational function, because it was passive and was not access control.  Ron said IPSs need to be treated as part of operations (they are a firewall, after all) because they block traffic.  Ron also pointed out confusion between credit card theft and identity theft.  Some people consider the two events to be the same.  This is not the case, since recovering from a stolen credit card is much easier.Here is Ron's bio, for those of you not familiar with him.Ron Gula - President and Chief Technical Officer, Tenable Network SecurityMr. Gula was the original author of the Dragon IDS and CTO of Network Security Wizards which was acquired by Enterasys Networks. At Enterasys, Mr. Gula was Vice President of IDS Products and worked with many top financial, government, security service providers  and commercial companies to help deploy and monitor large IDS installations. Mr. Gula was also the Director of Risk Mitigation for US Internetworking and was responsible for intrusion detection and vulnerability detection for one of the first application service providers. Mr. Gula worked for BBN and GTE Internetworking where he conducted security assessments as a consultant, helped to develop one of the first commercial network honeypots and helped develop security policies for large carrier-class networks. Mr. Gula began his career in information security while working at the National Security Agency conducting penetration tests of government networks and performing advanced vulnerability research.

But I believe that enforcement actions must be taken as well. There is some sign that cooperation between enforcement agencies in the UK, Israel, and Russia have been effective. The most important was the breaking up of a ring of cyber-extortionists in 2003 that dramatically slowed the number of DDOS incidents.As it will be a while before prosperity finds its way to every corner of the globe it is imperative that law enforcement agencies start working together to track down and jail cyber criminals now.\"He is completely correct.  Remember the risk equation: Risk = Threat x Vulnerability X Cost (of asset).  We security practitioners (and our clients) can only really influence the vulnerability aspect of the equation.  We can't usually decrease the value of an asset, either.  Only those in law enforcement or the military can take direct action against threats.  The only real way to eliminate risk is to eliminate the threat.  No amount of countermeasures can remove all vulnerabilities and keep a determined adversary from exploiting a target.  Making the threat go to zero is the only way to make risk go to zero.Stiennon also points out a fascinating  chronology of data breaches since the ChoicePoint incident.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

This focus on regulatory issues is causing a loss of control over the security agenda, which is being pushed and dictated by the audit and controls group and meeting the requirements of the regulation.\"I see this focus on \"controls\" as more of the \"prevention first and foremost\" strategy that ignores the importance of detection and response.

Yes.Are organizations that have a documented information security policy less, more, or equally likely to implement system security measures? Yes.Are organizations that have a documented information security policy less, more, or equally likely to implement information security compliance measures? Yes.Are organizations that have a documented information security policy less, more, or equally likely to have an information security awareness program? Yes.Are organizations that employ information security compliance measures, an information security awareness program, and system security measures less, more, or equally likely to experience security incidents?

In the following screen shot, you can see that the After using NeWT we tried In the following screen shot, I'm running NeVO on my Windows 2000 system as I browse various Web sites.I've highlighted an alert that shows 128.178.42.93 is running a Web server with a potentially vulnerable version of PHP.  You may also see 216.133.72.171 is running a potentially vulnerable version of PostNuke.  I say \"potentially\" in both cases, because NeVO makes its decision on the information it sees the Web server report.  For example:orr:/home/richard$ nc -v 128.178.42.93 80Connection to 128.178.42.93 80 port [tcp/ succeeded!HEAD / HTTP/1.0HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Sun, 03 Jul 2005 22:05:31 GMTServer: Apache/1.3.28 (Linux/SuSE) PHP/4.3.3Last-Modified: Tue, 20 Nov 2001 10:40:36 GMTETag: \"2c3a3-a7-3bfa3324\"Accept-Ranges: bytesContent-Length: 167Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlIf we trust the banner reported above, we know 128.178.42.93 is vulnerable.I think passive vulnerability assessment is a powerful tool.  It's a continuous way to discover assets, enumerate services, and identify vulnerabilities.  It uses zero bandwidth and has no adverse affects on targets.  It's completely silent so no one knows it is working.  NeVO doesn't just watch servers; it also watches clients.  In this age of client-side exploitation, identifying vulnerable Web browsers or mail clients is critical.I expect to see increased use of passive methods, especially in large networks.  It makes sense to do as much vulnerability assessment as possible using passive methods, and finish the enumeration process actively.Next we turned to Tenable's log aggregation product  (.pdf) white paper.Thunder is paired with After Tenable I headed down the street to .  The Snort Certified Professional (SnortCP) sounds interesting.  We also talked about the upcoming  (OSSRC) meeting on Thursday 7 July at 1200 EDT in irc.freenode.net, #ossrc.As Snort product manager, Jennifer shared with me that Snort 2.4.0 will be released soon.  I also got a look at Sourcefire's new HQ, which is a two-building affair down the street from the old campus I visited .  They needed two buildings to accommodate the large data center where hundreds of rack-mounted servers are housed -- many of which build Snort and its rules, for you, for free!Speaking of rules, Jennifer says we can expect to see the new Snort rules language some time next year, paired with a release of Snort 3.0.  I am particularly excited by that development.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

She said\"Our policy will also set June 2008 as the date by which all agencies\u2019 infrastructure (network backbones) must be using IPv6 and agency networks must interface with this infrastructure.  Once the network backbones are ready, the applications and other elements will follow.\"If only the backbone needs to be running IPv6, it's possible -- but not probable -- that \"all agencies\" will be using IPv6.  This section, however, made me laugh -- for reasons I'll explain shortly.\"[W]e are about to issue a policy memorandum providing guidance to the agencies to ensure an orderly and secure transition to IPv6...[A]gencies will develop an inventory of existing IP capable devices and technologies. To ensure an orderly transition from IPv4 to IPv6, we must establish a baseline and determine the size of the problem... While we know IPv6 technologies are deployed throughout the government, but like other organizations, we do not know specifically which ones, how many there are, or precisely where they are located.  We are planning for each agency to file a report of their inventory of IP capable devices and technologies to OMB in the first quarter of FY 2006.\"First quarter of FY 2006?  Does that mean between 1 Oct and 31 Dec 2005?  Is she serious?Let's look at the Navy's experience with determining the number of systems for which it is responsible.  The story  by Ashlee Vance demonstrates the Navy's experience with \"The U.S. Navy recently launched its first enterprisewide IT asset discovery and management initiative... Since January, the Navy has been using a hosted software service from Mountain View, California-based BDNA Corp. to scan the IP addresses of hardware and software residing on its sprawling MCI network. The effort has enabled the Navy to identify and locate more than 250,000 systems installed in some 200 locations throughout the continental U.S. and Hawaii and Alaska, said Capt. Chris Christopher...In the coming months, the Navy expects to pinpoint at least 250,000 more systems it has deployed on its bases and ships around the world using the centralized network scanning approach...Christopher placed the cost of the BDNA asset discovery services at 'more than six figures' on an annual basis.\"This story demonstrates the difficulty of enumerating all assets in government organizations.  It seems Karen Evans and OMB need to rethink the scope of their problem.  I would have thought that developing \"an inventory of existing IP capable devices and technologies\" would have been part of normal system and asset administration practices, not a precursor to IPv6 adoption.

The second tells BIND to only forward DNS requests.  The third line tells BIND where to forward requests.So what's the purpose of this setup?  I am running BIND on a central system to which various remote sensors connect.  All of them will be configured to ask DNS requests of this central system through an IPSec tunnel.

If the Snort process and the database are on separate systems, especially across Internet space, Snort will definitely drop packets as it tries to insert alerts.Thank you,RichardI do not understand why people insist on deploying Snort without Barnyard and other spool readers make a huge difference.  Snort writes its output to disk.  Barnyard reads the output and takes care of the inserts to the DB.Decoupling that process allows Snort to run as fast as possible, and the system becomes more tolerant of delays or breaks in the line between the sensor and DB.Only in late 2004 did the  distribution make Barnyard the default output processing system.

Anti-virus, Intrusion detection, Intrusion Prevention, Deep Packet Inspection - they all do the same thing: try to enumerate all the bad things that can happen to a computer.

Here are my thoughts on the CISSP and an answer to Tom's blog.  (I did not realize Tom has On page 406 of my first \"I believe the most valuable certification is the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP). I don't endorse the CISSP certification as a way to measure managerial skills, and in no way does it pretend to reflect technical competence. Rather, the essential but overlooked feature of the CISSP certification is its Code of Ethics...This Code of Ethics distinguishes the CISSP from most other certifications. It moves security professionals who hold CISSP certification closer to attaining the true status of 'professionals.'\"In my book I compared the CISSP Code of Ethics to the , which I first wrote about .  The second point of the NSPE code is \"Perform services only in areas of their competence.\"  This is similar to the following CISSP code excerpt:\"Provide diligent and competent service to principals.\"My book made this comment:\"I find the second point especially relevant to security professionals. How often are we called upon to implement technologies or policies with which we are only marginally proficient? While practicing computer security does not yet bear the same burden as building bridges or skyscrapers, network engineers will soon face responsibilities similar to physical engineers.\"Given this background, from where does the CISSP's value, if any, derive?  I believe the answer lies in the values one wants to measure.  First, the CISSP and other \"professional\" certifications are not designed to convey information about the holder to other practitioners.  Rather, certifications are supposed to convey information to less informed parties who wish to hire or trust the holder.  The hiring party believes that the certifying party (like ISC2) has taken steps to ensure the certification holder meets the institution's standards.  Second, I would argue the CISSP is not, or at least should not, be designed or used to test technical competence.  Certifications like the Third, there is nothing wrong with stating what would seem obvious.  Tom reduces his argument against the CISSP Code of Ethics to the title of his blog entry: \"Don't Be Evil.\"  I agree, and I do not see the problem with expanding on that idea as the CISSP's Code of Ethics does.So, what is wrong with the CISSP?  I previously It is based upon an accepted common body of knowledge that is well understood, published and consistent with the objectives of the community applying it.  No.  The CISSP It requires ongoing training and updating on new developments in the field.  Partially.  The CISSP CPE requirements ensure holders need to receive training prior to renewal, but I am not sure this equals exposure to new developments.  If you attend Tom's  talk, you get 16 Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits!  :)There is an an examination (the exception is grandfathering, where extensive experience may be substituted). Yes.Experience is required. Yes.  Experience is required for the CISSP, mainly in response to this  of a 17-year-old receiving his CISSP.Grandfathering is limited to a brief period at the time of the founding of the certification.  I am not sure why this matters, other than Stephenson needed to justify his involvement in the It is recognised in the applicable field. Well, the CISSP is certainly recognized.  Unfortunately it is often mis-recognized as a technical cert, when it should be strictly a symbol of adherence to professional conduct.It is provided by an organization or association operating in the interests of the community, usually non-profit, not a training company open to independent peer review. Partially.  I began to worry when I saw ISC2 offer , and now they have the , pictured above.  I am not convinced this element matters that much anyway, as I think Cisco's certification program is excellent.I think the root of the problem is the concept that the CISSP somehow measures technical competence.  The CISSP in no way measures technical skills.  Rather, it should measure knowledge of security principles.  It does not meet that goal, either.  At this point we are left with a certification that only provides a code of ethics.  That brings us back to my original point.From a practical point of view, I obtained my CISSP four years ago to help pass corporate human resource departments who screen resumes.  Back then I had two choices when looking for employment.  I could either work through a friend who knew my skills, or I could submit a resume to a company with an HR department.  Rather than rely completely on the former, I decided to keep the latter as an option.  Getting through HR departments usually required a CISSP certification.  Does this mean I will renew my CISSP when it expires?  I am not sure.  If I see improvements in the certification, such that it reflects security principles, I may.  If it continues to fail in that respect, I probably will not.  What are your plans?  Why or why not do you pursue the CISSP?Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I found a detail in this \"The Trojan sent images and documents to FTP servers in Israel, Germany and the US, court documents reveal.\"Regular blog readers know what that means.  Any victim company practicing Network Security Monitoring could have complete records of the FTP traffic that carried documents or files stolen by the Trojan Horses.  NSM practitioners would know when the activity started, what systems were victims, and when the last outbound connection took place.  Depending on the form of the FTP transfers and the capture of full content data, NSM pros might even know exactly what was stolen.Those running a defensible network might have deployed FTP proxies that carry all outbound FTP traffic.  That outbound FTP proxy would have logged all of the files that were carried outbound.  Of course the file names might have nothing to do with the documents stolen from hard drives, but a record of illegal activity would still exist.I consider watching outbound activity to be practicing extrusion detection.  Supposedly stopping outbound activity is called extrusion prevention, and I already see vendors using these terms.  Richard Steinnon prefers the term \"intellectual property protection\" (IPP).  I think IPP is a form of extrusion something, but the idea of IPP assumes that what is being sent outbound has any IP value.

The conference organizers told me this is the 7th such event, and they have over 1,000 attendees.  The vendor exhibits and program seems very host-based forensics-centric.  It seems that every associates the word \"forensics\" with host-based evidence, with few exceptions.  I am sensitive to this situation as I devote several chapters in my new book Extrusion Detection to network-centric incident response and forensics.  I intend for these chapters to supplement existing excellent works that take a traditional host-centric view of both disciplines.  I am also acutely aware of network-centric IR and forensics as I continue to improve my new  class.So why do I consider network IR and forensics to be important?  In my experience, quite often investigators don't know where to begin the IR or forensics process.  Security staff have indicators that their enterprise is compromised, but they are not sure where to look.  To compound a bad situation, consider the consequences of poking around potentially compromised hosts.  Not only are you potentially alerting the intruder to your investigation.  You are also potentially damaging or destroying important host-based evidence.  Therefore, I like to start with network evidence when conducting IR and forensics, and use network-based evidence (NBE) to learn where I should focus my host-based IR and forensics work.  Analyzing NBE never touches sensitive victim hosts, and NBE can often be captured without revealing the collection process to the intruder.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I never saw SANS teach commercial products at my first SANS conference in 1999, nor at the first I believe there are places inside the enterprise where open source may not be as suited or as capable as proprietary software.  Some people cannot live without Microsoft Active Directory.  Mounting directories over NFS isn't quite the same as using Microsoft's protocols.

I will publish his thoughts in my new book Extrusion Detection, but he's allowed me to print those comments here and now.  I find them very interesting.\"The original idea behind proxies was to have something that interposed itself between the networks and acted as a single place to 'get it right' when it came to security. FTP-gw was the first proxy I wrote, so I dutifully started reading the RFC for FTP and gave up pretty quickly in horror. Reading the RFC, there was all kinds of kruft in there that I didn't want outsiders being able to run against my FTP server. So the first generation proxies were not simply an intermediary that did a 'sanity check' against application protocols, they deliberately limited the application protocols to a command subset that I felt was the minimum that could be done securely and still have the protocol work. For example, while writing FTP-gw I realized that the PORT command would cause a blind connection from TCP port 20 to anyplace, over which data would be transferred. Port 20 was in the privileged range and I was able to predict an 'rshd' problem so I quietly emailed the guys at Berkeley and got them to put a check in ruserok() to forestall the attack. I also added code to make sure that the client couldn't ask the server to send data to any host other than itself, forestalling FTP PORT scanning. So I 'invented' 'FTP bounce' attacks in 1990 by preventing them with my proxy.There are several other examples of where, in implementing proxies, I was horrified to see gaping holes in commonly-used application protocols, and was able to get them fixed before they were used against innocent victims. Since the proxies implemented the bare minimum command set to allow an application protocol to work, a lot of attacks simply failed against the proxy because it only knew how to do a subset of the protocol. When the hackers started searching for vulnerabilities to exploit in the internet applications suite, they often found holes in seldom-used commands or in poorly tested features of the RFC-compliant servers. But often, when they tried their tricks against the proxy all they'd get back was: 'command not recognized'.  The proxy gave a single, controllable, point where these fixes could be installed.The problem with proxies is that they took time and effort and a security-conscious analyst to write them and design them. And sometimes the proxy ran up against a design flaw in an applicationprotocol where it couldn't really make any improvement to the protocol. The first reaction of the proxy firewall vendors was to tell their customers, 'well, protocol XYZ is so badly broken thatyou just can't rely on it across an untrusted network.' This was, actually, the correct way (from a security standpoint) to solve the problem, but it didn't work. Around the time when the Internet was becoming a new media phenomenon, a bunch of firewalls came on the market that were basically smart packet filters that did a little bit of layer-7 analysis. These 'stateful firewalls' were very attractive to end users because they didn't even TRY to 'understand' the application protocols going across them, except for the minimum amount necessary to get the data through. For example, one popular firewall from the early 90's managed the FTP PORT transaction by looking for a packet from the client with the PORT command in it, parsing the PORT number and address out of it, and opening that port in its rulesbase. Fast? Certainly. Transparent to the end user? Totally. Secure? Hardly. But these 'stateful firewalls' sold very well because they offered the promise of high performance, low end-user impact, and enough security that an IT manager couldsay they'd tried.There are a few vendors who have continued to sell proxy firewalls throughout the early evolution of the Internet, but most of the proxy firewalls are long gone. Basically, the customersdidn't want security; they wanted convenience and the appearance of having tried. What's ironic is that a lot of the attacks that are bedeviling networks today would never have gotten through the early proxy firewalls. But, because the end user community chose convenience over security, they wound up adopting a philosophy of preferring to let things go through, then violently slamming the barn door after the horse had exited. Proxies keep cropping up over and over, because they are fundamentally a sound idea. Every so often someone re-invents the proxy firewall - as a border spam blocker, or a 'web firewall' or an 'application firewall' or 'database gateway' - etc. And these technologies work wonderfully. Why? Because they're a single point where a security-conscious programmer can assess the threat represented by an application protocol, and can put error detection, attack detection, and validity checking in place. The industry will continue to veer back and forth between favoring connectivity and favoring security depending on which fad is in the ascendant. But proxies are going to be with us for the long term, and have been steadfastly keeping networks secure as all the newfangled buzzword technologies ('stateful packet inspection,' 'intrusion prevention,' 'deep packet inspection') come  - and go.\" This is a report he wrote for a client, but he's sharing it with the world.

        "content": "A recent issue of  magazine featured an excellent set of .  I thought Greg Shipley's  cover piece to be very insightful.  Here are a few excerpts:\"Our testing uncovered overhyped features, signs of innovation, emerging challenges and useful new capabilities. But what struck us most was what isn't being said -- that market demands are shifting the ground under legacy firewall vendors, and some will have a hard time holding on. Network access control is no longer a perimeter-only game, and the need for protection mechanisms is deeper than the address-and-service restrictions we're used to. More important, network security is no longer viewed as a product to be tacked on, but rather a core requirement. This is a fundamental shift in thinking.\"Security as a \"core requirement\" is great news.  It's only taken a decade of constant Internet attack to get vendors to understand this point, but at least we're getting there now.\"We know enterprises building a cohesive network-protection strategy need these questions answered: Will next-generation routers and switches come bundled with application-level policy enforcement? Will silicon-based network-access-control devices finally overtake their PC-based rivals? Will today's NIPS (network intrusion-prevention systems) become tomorrow's firewalls, or vice versa? Will network infrastructure heavyweights like Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks finally put the squeeze on companies like Check Point Software Technologies and Internet Security Systems?\"Here are my answers.  Yes, yes, NIPS and \"firewalls\" will be the same device, and Cisco and Juniper will buy their competition.\"There's been much talk about the demise of NIDS (network-based intrusion-detection system) technology. The thinking goes that IDS will perish in favor of the seemingly more proactive IPS. This misses the bigger point: So-called network intrusion prevention is another policy-enforcement capability that's closer in purpose to today's firewalls than it is to detection and monitoring efforts... the enterprise market won't continue to see NIPSs and firewalls as different technology areas, with good reason. Shouldn't our firewalls protect us from the network-based attacks that NIPS claims to deflect? Why buy and maintain two devices for essentially the same task?  NIPS is a feature, not a product; it's just taking the industry some time to figure this out. Assuming we're right, does that convergence end with NIPS and conventional firewalls? Or do advanced network access control and pattern recognition eventually make their way into conventional routers and switches? We think it's inevitable.\"Wow, I'm not sure how much of this clear thinking I can take in one day.  Richard Clarke's comments were enough, but I surely appreciate Greg Shipley's insights.  If you read , you'll see that your Cisco router can already perform classic firewall and now so-called \"NIPS\" functions.  If you consider ACLs a firewalling function, they've been in IOS since 1993, and more advanced features like dynamic ACLs (aka The difference between the features of a router and an appliance like TippingPoint is power and number of signatures.

So businesses must accept this and design their systems for failure. This is the only sure way to stay running in a crisis. It comes down to basic risk management and business continuity practices.'Organizations have to architect their system to be failure-tolerant and that means compartmentalizing the system so it doesn't all go down... and they have to design it in a way that it's easy to bring back up,' he says.\"Preach on, Mr. Clarke!The same SC Magazine issue featured a , pictured at left.

        "content": "In my  I took some heat from an anonymous poster who seems to think I invent definitions of security terms.  I thought it might be helpful to reference discussions of terms like risk, threat, and vulnerability in various documents readers would recognize.Let's start with  SP 800-30: Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems.  In the text we read:\"Risk is a function of the likelihood of a given threat-source's exercising a particular potential vulnerability, and the resulting impact of that adverse event on the organization. To determine the likelihood of a future adverse event, threats to an IT system must be analyzed in conjunction with the potential vulnerabilities and the controls in place for the IT system.\"The document outlines common threats:Natural Threats: Floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, landslides, avalanches, electrical storms, and other such events.Human Threats Events that are either enabled by or caused by human beings, such as unintentional acts (inadvertent data entry) or deliberate actions (network based attacks, malicious software upload, unauthorized access to confidential information).Environmental Threats: Long-term power failure, pollution, chemicals, liquid leakage.I see no mention of software weaknesses or coding problems there.  So how does NIST define a vulnerability?\"Vulnerability: A flaw or weakness in system security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be exercised (accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited) and result in a security breach or a violation of the system's security policy.\"The NIST pub's threat-vulnerability pairings table makes the difference between the two terms very clear:SP 800-30 talks about how to perform a risk assessment.  Part of the process is threat identification and vulnerability identification.  Sources of threat data include \"history of system attack, data from intelligence agencies, NIPC, OIG, FedCIRC, and mass media,\" while sources of vulnerability data are \"reports from prior risk assessments, any audit comments, security requirements, and security test results.\"The end of SP 800-30 provides a glossary:Threat: The potential for a threat-source to exercise (accidentally trigger or intentionally exploit) a specific vulnerability. Threat-source: Either (1) intent and method targeted at the intentional exploitation of a vulnerability or (2) a situation and method that may accidentally trigger a vulnerability. Threat Analysis: The examination of threat-sources against system vulnerabilities to determine the threats for a particular system in a particular operational environment. Vulnerability: A flaw or weakness in system security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be exercised (accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited) and result in a security breach or a violation of the system's security policy.For those of you Microsoft-only shops, consider their take on the problem in the .   offers these definitions:Risk: The combination of the probability of an event and its consequence. (ISO Guide 73)Risk management: The process of determining an acceptable level of risk, assessing the current level of risk, taking steps to reduce risk to the acceptable level, and maintaining that level of risk.Threat: A potential cause of an unwanted impact to a system or organization. (ISO 13335-1)Vulnerability: Any weakness, administrative process, or act or physical exposure that makes an information asset susceptible to exploit by a threat. Microsoft then offers separate appendices with  and I'd like to add that the comment on my earlier posting said I should look up \"threat\" at An expression of an intention to inflict pain, injury, evil, or punishment.An indication of impending danger or harm.One that is regarded as a possible danger; a menace.Remember what we are debating here.  I am concerned that so-called \"security professionals\" are mixing and matching the terms \"threat\" and \"vulnerability\" and \"risk\" to suit their fancy.  Here's Susceptible to physical or emotional injury.Susceptible to attack: \u201cWe are vulnerable both by water and land, without either fleet or army\u201d (Alexander Hamilton).Open to censure or criticism; assailable.Liable to succumb, as to persuasion or temptation.You'll see both words are nouns.  But -- a threat is a party, an actor, and a vulnerability is a condition, a weakness.  Threats exploit vulnerabilities.Finally, The possibility of suffering harm or loss; danger.Risk is also a noun, but it is a measure of possibility.  These are three  distinct terms.  It is not my problem that I define them properly, in accordance with others who think clearly!  I am not inventing any new terms.  I'm using them correctly.I'd like to thank  for reminding me of the NIST and Microsoft docs.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

That document produced several leads.  First, it mentioned the ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/.      The link to the CISCO-STACK-MIB brought me to the .  This is a really helpful tool.  You can Another excellent resource is the  tool.  For example, here are all of the MIBs supported by the Cisco 2950 switch.  Cisco offers a few other helpful sites.  These include the  page.  That site has a link labelled MIB Locator.  Follow it, select your IOS release, platform family (device), and IOS feature set, and you will learn what MIBs are present.  Also useful are  and the IP Application Services page for Getting back to the original question -- the original Cat OS discussion of the CISCO-STACK-MIB mentioned the  link on the sysTraffic page shows the Cisco IOS images which offer this SNMP value.

While we have socket information (source IP, source port, destination IP, destionation port), we do not have timestamps.

        "content": "When reading today's , I learned of the public release of    The Host Requirements RFC [4] states that a TCP MUST act on an ICMP   error message passed up from the IP layer, directing it to the   connection that created the error.   In order to allow ICMP messages to be demultiplexed by the receiving   host, part of the original packet that elicited the message is   included in the payload of the ICMP error message.  Thus, the   receiving host can use that information to match the ICMP error to   the instance of the transport protocol that elicited it.   Neither the Host Requirements RFC [4] nor the original TCP   specification [1] recommend any security checks on the received ICMP   messages.  Thus, as long as the ICMP payload contains the correct   four-tuple that identifies the communication instance, it will be   processed by the corresponding transport-protocol instance, and the   corresponding action will be performed.   Therefore, an attacker could send a forged ICMP message to the   attacked host, and, as long as he is able to guess the four-tuple   that identifies the communication instance to be attacked, he can use   ICMP to perform a variety of attacks.I was unaware that TCP services paid any real attention to ICMP messages, since TCP has its own mechanisms for handling errors (unlike UDP).

Where do I start?  I click on the link  and end up at a page titled \"Windows Security Updates Summary for April 2005.\"  This page lists five security bulletins, Security Bulletin MS05-016 through MS05-20.  I can't really tell a whole lot looking at the information on this page, although the \"Technical bulletin\" item for each yields clues.  The first security bulletin, MS05-016 says .  Remote code execution is always bad.  Does this mean an attacker can exploit a listening Windows service?  I can't tell.  I do click on the technical bulletin link to learn more.Now I'm on a  page.  It says the \"Impact of Vulnerability\" is \"Remote Code Execution.\"  I still don't see anything which clues me in to how this vulnerability can be exploited.  I decide to click on the link \"Vulnerability Details.\"  Under the title \"Windows Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0063:\" we read the following:\"A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows Shell because of the way that it handles application association. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.\"Ok, I still don't know if this vulnerability affects a listening service.  Under \"Vulnerability details\" there's also a \"FAQ for Windows Shell Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0063:\", which I click.Finally I read the answer to my question:\"How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?An anonymous attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to open a specially crafted file. Opening this file could then cause the affected system to run code. The vulnerability would generally be exploited through unregistered file name extension types.\"At least I learn that this \"Remote Code Execution\" vulnerability involves an administrator opening a malicious file.  Does this process seem ridiculous to you too?  Now I have to perform the same process for the other vulnerabilities.  How long is that going to take?I suggest Microsoft publish a single page with a table showing the salient details of each new vulnerability.  Those of us with network security responsibilities would probably like to see a table column with the title \"Involves listening service vulnerable to attack\" or similar.  That way, we could quickly narrow our focus to the services which will likely become the targets for the next worm, script kiddie, or worse.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I downloaded and tried the new release, since the single .iso boots as a live CD.  This is a nice feature, as it lets you test your hardware's compatibility before installing the OS.  I have no plans to run this OS in production, but I might deploy a test system in my lab.Did you ever wonder why certain Linux users are so adamant about calling their OS \"GNU/Linux\"?  This is especially true of  kernel.  The HURD was the original kernel on which  would run.  The HURD wasn't making much progress when the Linux kernel arrived, so people starting running GNU utilities on the Linux kernel.  People who remembered the HURD kernel and the importance of the GNU utilities prefer to say \"GNU/Linux,\" to differentiate that setup from \"GNU/HURD.\"Today I saw that the  project is making progress.  This is a system where GNU userland tools run on top of the , specifically 5.3 RELEASE.  Yesterday a live CD for version 1.1 of the project appeared To those who ask \"why?\", I reply \"why not?\"  Should enough people decide they do not like additional Linux kernel development problems, they could try replacing the Linux kernel with FreeBSD.  I think it makes more sense for converts to simply run FreeBSD, since the BSDs' userlands are more tightly integrated with the kernel than Linux.  Still, projects like these extend the envelope of operating system understanding and show innovation.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

In a related story, Curt described how he did the forensics on the hard drive of .  Curt also set up the network that Russian hackers  thought was .  One of the details that emerged from Curt's monitoring of the Invita Security network involved a password used by Alexey Ivanov.  When accessing one of his drop sites, Alexey's FTP password was www.pidor.com ( available).  Think of what an unwary analyst might do with that information.  Only someone who is monitoring Alexey's actions might know about www.pidor.com.  Say that unwary analyst decides to visit www.pidor.com to learn more about the site.  If Alexey or a friend is monitoring Web accesses to www.pidor.com, they could learn that they are being monitored.

The foreword says 'Security professionals are going to be approaching management for funding in the next year or two to procure intrusion prevention devices, especially intelligent switches from 3Com (TippingPoint), as well as host-based intrusion prevention solutions like Cisco Security Agent, Platform Logic, Ozone, or CrossTec.' This foreword was the first time I had heard of several of these products, but unfortunately none of them receive any coverage at all in IPAAR. Aside from a short discussion of the Enterasys Web IPS, eEye's SecureIIS, and improvements in Microsoft IIS 6.0, IPAAR squarely concentrates on open source products. Nevertheless, the book does a better job covering so-called prevention solutions than the previous book with 'prevention' in the title, e.g., Osborne's .\"Regular blog readers know I consider network-based \"intrusion prevention systems\" to be layer 7 firewalls.  If a network-based device is making an access control decision, it is a firewall.  Generically speaking, any device which makes access control decisions is a policy enforcement system (PES?).  We simply have a popular name for a PES that operates at the network level -- it's a firewall.  Just as network PES enforces policy on packets, a host PES enforces policy on system calls and other operating system activities.  I think host PES accurately describes Niels Provos' , aka ProPolice.  I would like nothing better than to completely abolish the term \"intrusion prevention system.\"  Isn't every part of the security process trying to prevent intrusions?

Briefly, they are the nation's critical infrastructures remain vulnerable to attack, and federal security research and development funding is misallocated.  PITAC estimates \"there are fewer than 250 active cyber security or cyber assurance specialists, many of whom lack either formal training or extensive professional experience in the field.\"  I agree with this claim; it is very difficult to find anyone with deep and broad security degrees and experience I would trust to teach future practitioners.I was pleased to see the report list the following as some of its ten research priorities, as they are near to my own interests:- Monitoring and Detection.  Regardless of progress made in the preceding research areas, unanticipated events will still occur. When they do, tools to monitor and understand what is happening are needed to enable the proper deployment of appropriate defensive measures. The ability of current tools that monitor irregular network activity to rapidly identify the underlying cause is primitive. The current advantage that adversaries enjoy will increase as they become more knowledgeable and as the Internet becomes larger and more complex. Research subtopics include: -- Dynamic protection that can react when attacks are detected, possibly by increasing monitoring activities -- Global scale monitoring and intrusion detection -- Monitoring of systems to ensure that they meet declared security policies -- Better tools based on improved models that characterize \"normal\" behavior -- Real-time data collection, storage, mining, and analysis during a crisis -- Usable presentation interfaces that allow operators to better understand incidents in progress- Cyber Forensics: Catching Criminals and Deterring Criminal Activities.  The rapid arrest and conviction of criminals is a primary goal of law enforcement and also serves as a deterrent. When potential criminals believe there is a strong chance that they will be caught and convicted, they are more reluctant to commit crimes. Current capabilities to investigate cyber crime, identify perpetrators, gather and present evidence, and convict criminals are woefully inadequate. Compounding the problem, we do not really know how to deter cyber crime. Very few of the thousands of cyber criminals active today are being caught. There is a pressing need to develop new tools and techniques to investigate cyber crimes and prosecute criminals. Robust cyber forensic methods are also needed that will prove capable of withstanding the burden of proof in court, whether employed to prosecute criminals or exonerate the innocent. Research subtopics include: -- Identifying the origin of cyber attacks, including traceback of network traffic -- Identifying attackers based on their behavior -- Collecting evidence in uncooperative network environments  -- Tracing stolen information used in the growing traffic in fraud, identity theft, and intellectual property theft, including tools and protocols for recovering trace evidence from volatile and incompletely-erased computing media, disks, cell phones, PDAs, and embedded systems -- Tools and protocols to search massive data stores for specific information and indicators, possibly while the data stores are in use -- Fundamental research to develop forensic-friendly system architectures that are more amenable to investigation when incidents occurI intend to keep my eyes open for institutions looking for researchers to pursue these areas.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Last night I attended the northern Virginia pinata.\"  Several ISSA members took him to task for Microsoft's security failings, but I thought Dean was diplomatic and handled their mildly aggressive questions well.Dean said that the patching approach to security is becoming a \"second or third line defense, like backups.  You patch regularly but hope you don't need them.\"  As evidence he cited the decreasing window of time between announcement of a vulnerability and release of an exploit.  Patches are still the best way to fix a vulnerability in broken software, so Microsoft has been pursing multiple initiatives to improve their patches.  First, Microsoft is migrating from multiple update sites (e.g., , , and ) to a single future \"Microsoft Update\" site in late 2005.Second, Microsoft realized their seven profit and loss centers support eight different software installation methods.  This year they will move all software installation to two methods.  Operating systems will use .  This will make using , , and  (migrating to Windows Update Services) more predictable and effective.Third, Microsoft has worked to make their patches better.  They have a standardized naming convention to ease management.  They use binary diffs to reduce patch size.  They are also \"actually inspecting system configuration\" (as opposed to pretending to do so?) to determine what patches are really needed.  Dean next discussed .  This seemed like a fairly impressive way to lock down systems.  It automatically detects and configures Microsoft services and their options, Microsoft client applications and their options, third-party applications, IPSec policies, registry settings, audit features, and IIS.  Essentially you can apply all of Microsoft's recommended configuration options via an automated tool.  I was disappointed to see Dean's demo fail, but I see the promise of the technology.Dean mentioned a related tool called .  The idea behind this program is to run it for a week or so on a host to determine what applications users employ.  This helps administrators learn if XPSP2 will break any of the user's applications.  I hope to see more of this sort of tool for future Windows upgrades.Speaking of XPSP2, Dean gave a behind-the-scenes look at the reasons for its development.  Apparently the  had a huge effect on Microsoft.  They \"took almost all developers off Longhorn for a year to work on XPSP2.\"  The theme of XPSP2 was applying good default configurations.  For example, XPSP2 enables the Microsoft firewall by default.  It denies inbound connections to help prevent intrusions.  XPSP2 also denies null sessions by default.    Dean said XPSP2 has been downloaded 150 million times.  One of the ISSA attendees complained that XPSP2 features were not available for Windows 2000.  In fact, Dean said Internet Explorer 7.0 will only be available for XPSP2 (at least at present).  The ISSA attendee said it was too expensive for customers to upgrade to XP.  I wanted to say that the best update to Windows 2000 is Windows XP, but I kept quiet.  Dean replied to the other ISSA attendee that most big Microsoft customers with Windows 2000 installations \"already own Windows XP\" by virtue of their .  He said getting these customers to upgrade to Windows XP is one of Microsoft's biggest problems.Dean pitched four efforts Microsoft sees as being \"beyond patching.\"  Since he spent so much time on the earlier issues, Dean had to briefly describe each.  The four efforts are:1. Isolation and resiliency2. Network segmentation3. 4. Smart cards for remote accessI found his network segmentation discussion interesting.  Microsoft is pushing for an all-Regarding Microsoft's internal practices, Dean encouraged listeners to visit the  site.  There Microsoft publishers papers on how it secures its own network.  He said that Microsoft operates the largest wireless  for two years for VPN clients.I found Dean's short description of Rights Management Services to be intriguing.  It will use  and AES 128 encryption to protect individual documents.  Only those operating rights management-enabled programs should be able to read RM-protected documents.  I welcome the idea of a data-centric approach to security, but I am sure someone will figure out how to break this system.Beyond the four efforts already in production, Dean pointed to three future area for Microsoft:1. Network quarantine2. Vulnerability assessment3. Active protectionFirst,  will work with .  Initially they did not want to cooperate, but their  profiled the two technologies recently.  At first glance I prefer Cisco's 802.1x switch port-centric approach, rather than Microsoft's DHCP-centric method.  Who cares if I don't get a DHCP server to provide an IP, when I can steal what I need from another host?Dean's quarantine slide said NAP is \"not designed to protect against malicious users.\"  Somehow I think the Microsoft marketing drones will end up twisting NAP to be useful against malicious users.  Again referring to Blaster, Dean said 70% of his customer's compromises were caused by VPN users, and 30% by \"walk-ins.\"  Microsoft believes that if NAP can quarantine these sorts of users,  then it will help contain future Blaster-like problems.The second step, vulnerability assessment, is code named the \"Geneva feature set.\"  Microsoft seems to want to offer continuous internal vulnerability assessment services.  These will make further inroads to the security space, given Microsoft's , , and All of these are slated for One of my responses to this was to consider the complexity of all of the steps Microsoft is taking to implement security for hosts running Windows.  With complexity comes opportunity for misconfiguration, plus vulnerabilities introduced by new code and processes.  Microsoft might say their new systems will prevent rogue insiders or malicious outsiders from attacking Microsoft services.  It seems to me that the opportunity to attack the authentication and encryption services still exists.  Why bother to fool, bribe, or otherwise subvert a guard if you can silently kill him?I had a similar thought with respect to the IPSec-everywhere approach.  This will help preserve confidentiality and integrity within the enterprise.  However, most internal intruders are probably rogue insiders.  They will already have the authorization needed to access internal documents.  Independent network-based systems trying to audit internal activity will be blind to IPSec-encrypted traffic.  Is this trade-off worth it?  I'm not sure.As an aside, Dean mentioned a Windows feature of which I was unaware: .

Network Security Monitoring (NSM) is the collection, analysis, and escalation of indications and warnings to detect and respond to intrusions. NSM relies upon alert data, session data, full content data, and statistical data to provide analysts with the information needed to achieve network awareness. Whereas intrusion detection cares more about identifying successful and usually known attack methods, NSM is more concerned with providing evidence to scope the extent of an intrusion, assess its impact, and propose efficient, effective remediation steps.According to the I hope to see you in Anaheim!

As Voice over IP becomes popular, interest in voice security seems to be picking up.  The new SecureLogix product can monitor and control traditional POTS voice and also VoIP (SIP and H.323v2).  I found this note in one of the reviews alarming:\"The ETM 1090 system can capture digital recordings of any call and record up to eight simultaneous calls off one voice span. The 5.0 production release captures calls only off of a voice T1. SecureLogix is prepping VoIP recording for the next release.The ETM 1060 caches audio at a rate of 57 MB per hour from up to 32 simultaneous calls, yielding roughly 2,000 hours capacity on the appliance, and it automatically uploads the recorded calls to your target server drive as .wav files.ETM gives no indication to call participants that they are being recorded; check with your legal department before implementing any recording scheme.\"\"Check with your legal department\" indeed!

        "content": "Sometimes vendors send me gear to try in my lab.  I was fortunate to receive a The following is my impressions of the system, based on three assumptions.  First, I did not try to stress-test or attack the system to gauge its performance under load.  I placed it on a production network as any other client might.  Second, I did not validate its findings independently.  In other words, I did not collect information on another system to test if a StealthWatch \"high traffic\" alarm truly corresponded to a \"high traffic\" event.  Third, I did not fully configure the system as one might as a Lancope customer.  Full utilization of this or any security product usually demands a fair amount of local customization and tuning.  Given these assumptions, here is what I thought about the StealthWatch.StealthWatch provided me a great deal of information with an out-of-the-box configuration.  The only real changes I made when I deployed the system was defining which hosts were part of the \"inside\" network.  If I had disabled an unused sniffing interface as recommended by the StealthWatch sales engineers, I would not have seen the \"traffic lost\" alerts that appeared in the introductory screen.  I did not need to make any special adjustments for my deployment using a  tap.  I simply plugged the two TX lines coming out of the tap into two free sniffing interfaces on the StealthWatch.  This means I deployed the system in a passive mode; it did not block traffic based on its findings.  After performing some simple configuration on the local console, I remotely accessed the device using a HTTPS-enabled Web server.Introductory ScreenThe introductory screen summarizes concern indices for inside and outside traffic, and provides links to alarms.  The left hand size of the interface allows easy access to a variety of reporting and configuration options.Alarms ScreenThe alarms screen allows the user to view events StealthWatch considers odd or problematic.  The screen shown above lists all priorities together, but the user can filter to just show Critical alarms, Major alarms, and so on.  These alarms are not based on sigatures for malicious events.  Rather, you are more likely to see entries for unusually long traffic flows, unrecognized operating systems, and other network features not corresponding to StealthWatch's profile for normal activity. For demonstration purposes I investigated an outside (external) IP address that StealthWatch believed was sending a high amount of traffic.Host SummaryI saw that the host in question was responsible for a number of high total traffic alarms.  At this point I wanted to know more about the characteristics of these suspicious flows.  Luckily I was able to use the StealthWatch to perform two types of deeper analysis.  Flow AnalysisI was able to perform flow analysis on data that StealthWatch already collected.  The partial screen capture above shows that port 500 UDP is involved.  This means the traffic is probably IPSec key exchange.  To find out for sure, I moved to the second additional form of analysis -- packet analysis.Packet AnalysisStealthWatch does not log full content data by default, but users can configure it to do so.  I set up a packet capture filter to log traffic associated with the IP of interest in my investigation.  Although users can collect data in a text-format, packet-by-packet manner, I specified collecting full content data in libpcap format.  After several minutes I stopped the capture process, copied the data via the Web GUI to my local workstation, and opened it with Ethereal.  I do not show a screen capture of this here, but there are many options for recording full content data available in the Web GUI.Service ProfilesOne of the most powerful aspects of systems like StealthWatch is its ability to build profiles of normal network activity.  Deviations from these profiles are reported as anomalies.  These alarms can be viewed from the network security monitoring standpoint as indications of suspicious or malicious activity.  The screen shot above shows the service profile built for hosts on the monitored network.  These can and should be tuned for each system, allowing the security and network staff to spot the appearance of new and potentially unauthorized services.Traffic ProfilesIn addition to profiling services on hosts, StealthWatch offers a number of ways to profile traffic to and from those hosts.  I have selected one profile showing bandwidth usage, but many more options exist.Because I promised not to expose the entire StealthWatch interface on this blog, I will end this discussion by mentioning other features I found useful.  StealthWatch reports on new hosts and inactive hosts, helping networking staff keep an inventory of their systems.  The interface and recorded data allows a fairly thorough analysis of hosts and their activity.  Because this data is not based on signatures, you are likely to acquire evidence of activity you wouldn't find using other means.  My main complaint, based on experimenting with the product, is not unique to StealthWatch.  A common criticism of anomaly-based systems is their potential inability to explain why they consider an event to be problematic.  I did not find StealthWatch to be difficult in this respect, since an alarm for a \"long flow\" is unambiguous.  Getting to a deeper level of analysis can be a challenge for certain events.  In the previous example, I was able to use flow analysis to identify IPSec key exchange.  Getting down to the nitty-gritty via packet analysis required setting up a new packet capture process, however.  In this respect, StealthWatch resembles intrusion detection systems that do not provide at least a sample packet from the unusual activity.  I understand that giving the user a packet can be difficult when the event in question is a \"long flow\" or \"multiple operating systems.\"  I think such data is useful, even if not all alarms provide it.  Giving the analyst one or more sample packets with a \"long flow\" alarm would enhance his investigative arsenal and reduce the likelihood of ignoring \"false alarms.\"Overall I found the StealthWatch to be a powerful appliance.  I could see engineers deploying this system to provide indications and warnings on networks already monitored by traditional IDSs.  I think the utility of the system increases as the owner spends time tuning and configuring it, but the StealthWatch provides plenty of interesting data straight away.  From the network security monitoring perspective, StealthWatch provides alert data via its alarms, session data via flow analysis, statistical data via profiling, and full content data via packet collection.  I welcome this sort of functionality in commercial systems!Thank you to Jason Anderson at Update: Jason Anderson adds the following good news:\"In our upcoming release, we will now include ~100 bytes of packet data with every flow. It will include the initiating packet header and 40 bytes of payload data from the first packet in each direction.\"This helps address my earlier point about giving analysts the information necessary to investigate and validate events.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

We drove up from our Falls Church, VA office to meet with Sourcefire founder and Snort creator Marty Roesch.  Sourcefire is housed in an Ikea-type building constructed to house optical networking start-ups during the dot-com craze.  In addition to Sourcefire,  and another company called  share the space.We started our conversation with Marty by discussing the new .  Marty said that Sourcefire isn't a \"nameless, faceless company.  Real people work here.\"  He demonstrated Sourcefire's commitment to the security community by mentioning the change to the , previously reported here.  Marty reported that many companies, several of which he was previously unaware, have reported interest in Snort Integrator licenses.  As of this afternoon almost 2,000 people had already Besides helping to pay rule developer salaries, revenue from the new rules system will also help pay for the equipment Sourcefire uses to develop and test Snort.  At right is a picture of one of the racks of networking and testing infrastructure Sourcefire owns.  The racks holds $500,000 worth of  and  network traffic and load generation gear.  When Sourcefire develops a new rule, they don't just run Sourcefire tests that Snort is able to trigger an alert while watching a loaded network.  I would like to see someone replicate this setup in their basement!  In other words, it's not going to happen at anywhere near the same level of quality assurance.  This is the problem I have with ventures like those of .  Users should always be able to create their own rules, as that is one of the strengths of an open system like Snort.  However, they must be exceedingly careful not to cripple their IDS by writing poor rules.At left is a picture of some of the racks containing servers Sourcefire uses to develop Snort and associated components.  Marty said the company has over 26 racks with more than 300 servers.  They maintain gear for every version of their appliance they've shipped.  They also have target ranges and plenty of development systems.  When Sourcefire develops a new rule, for example, they perform 6.8 million regression tests to ensure the new rule does not adversely affect the rest of the rule base.  Sometimes these tests take up to four hours per change, even with the load distributed across multiple servers.  Sourcefire takes great care to ensure that their rules will not cause Snort to waste excessive time processing packets.  Marty told how a rule developed by an external Snort user once made such poor use of After looking at Sourcefire's server room, we toured the workspace.  Marty employees over 60 people in his Columbia, MD location at over 100 worldwide.  In addition to meeting with Judy Novak, who works on the VRT, we also spoke with Snort rule uber-creator Brian Caswell.  I mentioned that the Snort 2.3.1 ruleset had  not in the 2.3.0 distribution.  bmc told me that 2.3.1 packaged all of the new rules up to the date of the new licensing structure, which was 7 March.  We discussed having a future DC Snort Users Group meeting closer to Columbia, MD to accommodate the schedules of Marty and Brian.  I was surprised to see so many people working on Snort -- you can see in the picture the row upon row of cubicles.  There were two engineering meetings happening when I took the photo, so many desks are empty.After touring the floor we spoke to Marty about the future of Sourcefire.  He is excited about the new .  Marty reminded us that the ability to process packets per second was more important than a device's \"Gigabit\" rating.  I saw the IS5800 myself, so it is not just marketing hype.  I think it will be an amazing piece of gear for those who want to run Snort at speeds over 1 Gigabit.Near the end of our visit Marty made some interesting points about market pressure on the security scene.  He said Sourcefire felt the heat from Gartner's declaration that . (Incidentally, I  for $162 million in December 2004.)  The integration of the Snort-inline code gives stock Snort the capability to do IPS, which is currently the \"hot topic\" for security purchasers.  Apparently security commentators and reporters want nothing to do with intrusion detection; it's all about IPS now.  Unfortunately, we all know that prevention eventually fails.  Keith and I thanked Marty for spending nearly two hours with us.  We drove down the street and met  founder and CTO Ron Gula for lunch.  Ron made some good comments concerning the state of security certifications when he heard I passed my CCNA exam.  He said that no one can agree on how to approach the security problem.  He divided the world into people that \"do\" firewalls, IDS, vulnerability scanning, code audits, and a few other categories.  Each buys the product and/or service that fits their world view.  No one can agree on a standardized methodology to secure a network.  Some people think the CISSP meets this need, but anyone who has taken the test knows the CISSP fails miserably in this respect.  I  some thoughts on good certification features, and I wrote in The Tao that the best aspect of the CISSP is its .At some point in the future I would like to spend some time at Tenable to get a better look at their operations as well.

While I more or less agree with the IDS aspect, I believe Marty and crew are being pushed by market forces to adopt the IPS stance.  This is a shame, as we all know an \"IPS\" is a layer 7 firewall that inverts the access control best practice of \"allow some, deny everything else.\"  (In other words, an IPS performs a \"deny some, allow everything else\" function.)  I absolutely detest the IPS label and wish access control devices were simply identified as such, and not confused with audit devices (e.g., IDSs).The new site features a comprehensive .

Todd's class was excellent, and his book is almost literally Todd in written form. There is hardly a wasted word in this book. If Todd mentions a detail concerning a protocol or a certain default value in a configuration parameter, it's important. If he calls out that same item in a 'Note', it's definitely important. This is not 'teaching to the test' -- it's ensuring students and readers are familiar with material Cisco considers relevant.

I assigned 10.10.10.100/24 to the switch.  Because switches do not receive IPs on individual ports, I applied the IP to VLAN 1:gruden(config)#int vlan1gruden(config-if)#ip address 10.10.10.100 255.255.255.0gruden(config-if)#no shutdowngruden(config-if)#exitgruden(config)#ip default-gateway 10.10.10.1gruden(config-if)#endUnfortunately, this did not work.  I could not reach the router from the switch and vice-versa.I decided to try assigned a new IP address directly to router interface fa0/1, and give the switch an IP in the same netblock:gill(config)#int fa0/1gill(config-if)#ip address 192.168.168.1 255.255.255.0gill(config-if)#no shutdown gill(config-if)#endHere's how I configured the switch:gruden(config)#int vlan1gruden(config-if)#ip address 192.168.168.2 255.255.255.0gruden(config-if)#no shutdowngruden(config-if)#exitgruden(config)#ip default-gateway 192.168.168.1gruden(config-if)#endThat did it.  Now I can reach both devices.  Apparently the switch can only communicate with the router when the address on the switch is outside of the VLANs in use.  I believe Todd Lammle refers to this sort of setup as a management overlay network, where certain IPs are used solely for device management.If anyone can comment on this design or suggest an alternative, I welcome feedback.

This is an older book published in late 2001 which uses  as its reference version.  I like this book because each chapter covers topics which face router admins, like security, or access lists, or QoS.  The chapter then walks the reader through commands and examples.  Although IOS is a beast, the book seems to cover most of the commands normal admins would encounter.The natural companion to a router book is  by David Hucaby and Steve McQuarry, published by .  This book is slightly newer, published in late 2002.  It uses both IOS 12.2 and CatOS 7.2, as was found in older  switches, for example.  I like this book for the same reasons I liked its router counterpart -- rational organziation and plenty of examples.Continuing with our networking theme we come to  by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, published by .  I really liked his  which got mixed reviews at Amazon.com.  I like to use this book to check details of TCP features or related protocol issues.  I don't plan to read this book cover-to-cover as it addresses too many familiar topics, so I just look at sections of interest.I transition now from networking to operating systems.  My next book is  by Jerry Honeycutt, published by .  Why would I have this book in my possession?  First, I don't plan to read it.  Second, I got it free from Microsoft as part of some past promotion.  Third -- and the best reason -- it ships with a 180-day trial version of Windows Server 2003.  I have used this software to test Windows Server 2003 in my lab, so that makes having the book worthwhile.  As a book, it's just a product overview; you won't find any configuration syntax, only lists of features.This book has clearly been on my bookshelf for a while, since  is now available.   was written by Sriranga Veeraraghavan and Paul Watters, and published by Amazon.com reviewers universally like  by David Rhodes and Dominic Butler, published by .  This book appeared in late 2002, but it covers Solaris 8 and 9.  This book seems very thorough, and it doesn't waste time showing screen shots of CDE sessions or other material irrelevant to server use.  I do not see a Solaris 10 version in production.  Solaris 10 has enough new features to warrant a new edition.Our system administration journey continues with  by Randal Michael, published by  and mentions 4.3.3 as well.  My  runs AIX 5.1, which seems common in the industry.  This book is one of the few available on AIX.  I don't see much future in AIX, with the support IBM is giving to Linux.

Prentice Hall has continued to publish books on HP-UX, with titles on internals, tuning, and performance.

It ships with a CD-ROM of tools and video like the DVD in the PC book.     Some people criticized the laptop book for duplicating material in the PC book.

Browsing Amazon.com I see that the first edition of  should arrive this summer.  I am looking forward to this new book since the description references Sun servers.  That indicates Scott is branching beyond the Microsoft world.  However, later this summer we should also see , so it appears Scott is being dragged back to Microsoft land!Leaving the hardware world we come to  by Ronald L. Krutz and Russell Dean Vines, published by  by Michael C. Gregg.  I have not seen that book, but I referenced the earlier Exam Cram the night before my CISSP test.Continuing our security theme we arrive at  by Erik Schetina, Ken Green, Jacob Carlson, published by  Amazon.com Listmania List.  There may be other introductions to security available, but I like this book's concise form and its sound explanations.At the other end of the security spectrum we have 's magnum opus , published by .

It is definitely written for administrators, as it provides plenty of example command syntax and configuration guidance.  It is cross-platform, with advice on UNIX and Microsoft mail clients, as well as server products.If you use Sendmail you might want to read a different anti-spam book called  by Bryan Costales and Marcia Flynt, published by  helpful.We're in the home stretch now, with several titles on various subjects.

I am going to use it as a reference, but I will not start learning assembly with it.  The reason is its use of , which is included on the CD-ROM with the book.  I prefer to use open source alternatives.  This 4th ed of this book is getting much better reviews that previous versions, according to Amazon.com.Next is  by Joe Cooper, published by .  If you want to go to the source, try  by Jamie Cameron, published by .  Jamie wrote Webmin, and he spends more time on extending and customizing the product.  His book is more more complete when compared with Joe's.  I recommend Jamie's work if you are looking to create your own Webmin modules for in-house or commercial use.Finally we have  by Christopher Hertel, published by .

My personal opinion is that rogue insiders have the potential to cause the most damage, but the frequency with which they appear and cause havoc is lower than people think.  Outsiders, on the other hand, are frequently attacking and exploiting enterprises, but they are not often causing the sort of damage a rogue insider could.What do you think?  Which group presents the bigger risk?  I decided to frame this question with respect to risk, since one can estimate risk using the equationrisk = threat X vulnerability X cost of asset (replacement) or \"asset value\"On a related note, I found this October 2004 article by Anton Chuvakin to be interesting: .  He begins by questioning the claim made by the authors of the book , that \"Most of the global 2000 companies are currently infiltrated by hackers.

        "content": "More details are emerging regarding the .  I'd like to use this case to take a look at the various approaches used to perform incident response.  The first two methods are technical, and the third is non-technical.First we have the assessment approach.  This involves probing target systems which may have been involved in the incident.  Assessors look for security weaknesses in services and applications they believe could have yielded the information acquired by the intruders.  Jack Koziol's recent  is an example of this approach.In my opinion this method is least likely to yield useful information, and is often a waste of time, as far as determining the details of the incident at hand.  The assessment approach is largely speculation, albeit with access to some or all of the systems which could have been victimized.  From a forensic standpoint, this is a poor way to investigate an intrusion.  Assessors typically interact directly with victimized or potentially victimized systems.  Their \"investigation\" risks damaging evidence that could be retrieved by a forensic investigator.  Despite the harm caused by this method, I have read the CSO of an immense security company advocate this approach in her most recent book.The assessment approach is useful for incident recovery.  It is important to know the scope of a target's vulnerabilities before declaring a case \"solved.\"  It does no good to patch one hole if three remain open.  I wrote about combining assessment with incident response in a whitepaper for Foundstone titled .  Jack's probing of the T-Mobile site is valuable in that it shows they still have problems.  The assessment method may in some cases yield the answer to a problem by constructing an experiment resembling the incident.  's O-ring in ice water experiment shows the power of doing \"what-if\" incident response.  The problem I've seen in the digital realm is that the assessment-minded conduct their \"investigation\" on the original evidence (the victimized systems), thereby spoiling information for the next phase...The second technical way to investigate an incident is the forensic method.  This process centers on examining digital evidence collected from victimized or potentially victimized systems in a forensically sound manner.  Evidence is acquired carefully, in accordance with procedures most likely to withstand an adversarial legal system.  This contrasts starkly with the assessment method, where assessors typically \"race to root\" on the target and then declare \"victory.\"  The weakness of the forensic method lies in the lack of evidence or an absence of useful evidence.  I have performed many incident responses where I only acquired case-solving information by collecting it with my own products and processes.  Frequently the victim has not enabled sufficient logging, or he has trounced the evidence by performing his own amateur investigation.  While the former is usually not excusable, the second can often not be avoided.  If an administrator suspects something is wrong with one of her servers, she is most likely going to check it out before calling in outside forensic help.  Unfortunately, this destroys evidence that could have been collected in a fairly easy manner.The third way to investigate an intrusion is the law enforcement method.  I do not necessarily mean law enforcement is involved, although they are most likely to follow this technique.  Rather, I am referring to a non-technical, human source-oriented means of investigating an incident.  This method relies on cultivating informants, interviewing various parties, and conducting open research on threats that may have had the capabilities and intentions to harm a victim.Several examples can be found on the Web.   reports the following:\"An anonymous source provided O'Reilly Network with a screen grab, proving he was able to access the contents of Hilton's T-Mobile inbox as of Tuesday morning. Another image confirmed that Hilton's 'secret answer' was her dog's name.\"This Incidentally, CSC posted an voicemail/message center.\"  Essentially, the phones can be set up to trust callers and play voicemail based on caller ID, which can be spoofed.The law enforcement method can be the most successful means to resolve an intrusion.  It is especially helpful when digital evidence is lacking.  Often an investigator (most likely a real law enforcement agent) can acquire evidence pointing to the physical intruder, usually by speaking with informants.  The law enforcement agents then obtain digital, hard-copy, and physical evidence by obtaining a search warrant for the suspected intruder's home or office.  This is generally the only way to tie a person to a keyboard, which is the best means to successfully prosecute an intruder.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Chances are the original perpetrators obtained T-Mobile customer credentials (user names and passwords) and kept them to themselves, initially.  Then, to impress their friends, the intruders shared some or all of the data.  Eventually the credentials were passed to one or more parties who thought to make themselves \"famous\" by posting sensitive information fraudulently obtained with those user names and passwords.This \"disclosure cycle\" is similar to the way exploits circulate through the underground.  One or more people independently or jointly discover a vulnerability and code an exploit.  They keep it closely guarded, perhaps using it to access sensitive targets.  If they are professional black hats, they never reveal the fact they have the exploit.  If they are not using the exploit to advance certain goals, or they feel the exploit's shelf life is expiring, they pass the exploit to others.  That new group is more likely to circulate the exploit widely throughout the underground.  Eventually one or more black hats down the distribution food chain decide to go public, perhaps to gain some notoriety for themselves or their group.  It's an example of intruders becoming more sophisticated in the way they publicize their ability to gain unauthorized access to important systems.

The Jericho Forum describes itself as \"an international forum of IT customer and vendor organisations dedicated to the development of open standards to enable secure, boundaryless information flows across organisations.\"  I read stories on them as early as , two months after they formed.  The group appears to be built from representatives of European companies.  They are attracting attention for their \"de-perimeterisation\" and \"open network\" ideas, which their \"\" define as follows:\"de-perimeterisation: the act of applying organisational and technical design changes to enable collaboration and commerce beyond the constraints of existing perimeters, through cross-organisational processes, services, security standards and assurance\"\"open network: a network freely accessible at low or no cost to arbitrary communicationg parties, such as but not limited to the public global Internet, with few or no inbuilt information security controls protecting the use of that network (although the network infrastructure itself will typically have some protection in order to support the provision of a service of useful quality)\"If you'd like to read more wordy explanations, I recommend diving in to the 39-page \"Visioning White Paper.\"  It offers some of the most painful English I've seen.  I think it could have been reduced to 1/4 of its present size.Sorting through the text, we see The Jericho Group intends to push de-perimeterisation as a means to achive open networks.  They cite \"increasing on-line collaboration and trading among multiple business entities,\" \"outsourcing and offshoring of support services,\" and \"use of low cost open networks\" as reasons to pursue de-perimeterisation.  They believe \"existing security approaches are a barrier to change because they assume... an organizatrion owns, controls, and is accountable for the ITC [information and communications technology] it employs... and all individuals sit within organisations.\"  I do not disagree with either point.As for the group's focus, we read \"Jericho Forum will therefore primarily focus on information flows that span organisations and individuals and how to secure and manage these across open networks.  The focus will be on business to business (B2B) and business to government (B@G) flows, but not exclusively.\"The Jericho Group cites the following as evidence of the need for de-perimeterisation.  \"For complex networks, protocols, and application access requirements involving customers, business partners or suppliers, firewall complexity and cost of operation will rise... Many communication protocols now run within the web (HTTP) protocol to allow 'tunneling'; indeed arbitrary tunnelling is possible rendering 'layered' communications architectures meaningless... De-perimeterisation involves re-appraising where security controls are positioned, re-balancing cost and complexity.  This may involve moving security controls from firewalls or proxies to internal end systems or applications, or if the confidentiality or integrity of data is paramount, to move controls from the systems and data repositories that hold data at rest to the data itself (i.e. using cryptographic techniques.\"Leaving clunky language aside, let's consider their argument.  Although I do not see this mentioned in the group's paper, I would agree that individual hosts should be able to defend themselves.  This has historically been a problem for operating systems not designed to survive the public Internet.  I endorse making individual hosts and their applications more independent and reliable.  However, no organization that has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on firewalls and other perimeter security devices is going to abandon them.  Despite the starry-eyed cries of IPv6 developers who long for the days of unfettered end-to-end connectivity, most hosts on the Internet will continue to be separated by a wide variety of \"middleboxes.\"  Anywhere that organizational access controls can be deployed, they should be deployed.  When security rests entirely with the end host, the compromise of that end host means complete loss of control for the responsible enterprise.  If a \"de-perimeterised\" company suffers a worm outbreak, and it has abandoned its perimeter access controls and segmented subnets, what will stop the worm from spreading?  If that same organization is subjected to a denial of service attack, how will victim hosts on a \"de-perimeterised\" network defend themselves?A principle of security that will not disappear is defense-in-depth.  Hosts should be made to be self-reliant and survivable, and function within perimeters, however porous various technologies may seem to make them.Other stories on the Jericho Forum can be found Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Specifically, a threat is a party with the capabilities and intentions to exploit a vulnerability in an asset.  A vulnerability is a weakness in an asset that could lead to exploitation.  An intruder (the threat) exploits a hole (the vulnerability) in Microsoft IIS to gain remote control of a Web server.  In other words, threats exploit vulnerabilities.This is a simple concept, yet it is frequently confused by security prophets like Bruce Schneier in Beyond Fear.  Now .  In a posting to announce work on the upcoming , the Diary calls the new report the \"SANS CRITICAL INTERNET THREATS 2005\" and says:\"SANS Critical Internet Threats research is undertaken annually and provides the basis for the SANS 'Top 20' report. The 'Top 20' report describes the most serious internet security threats in detail, and provides the steps to identify and mitigate these threats.\"So, are we going to read a ranking of identified Romanian intruders, followed by Russian organized crime, Filipino virus writers, and then Zimbabwean foreign intelligence services?  Will mitigation include prosecution, incarceration, and the like?  Probably not, as the announcement continues:\"The current 'Top 20' is broken into two complimentary yet distinct sections:- The 10 most critical vulnerabilities for Windows systems.- The 10 most critical vulnerabilities for UNIX and Linux systems.\"So now we're talking about vulnerabilities.  That's what last year's \"Twenty Most Critical Internet Security Vulnerabilities\" addressed.  The announcement concludes:\"The 2005 Top 20 will once again create the experts' consensus on threats - the result of a process that brings together security experts, leaders, researchers and visionaries... In addition to the Windows and UNIX vulnerabilities, this year's research will also focus on the 10 most severe vulnerabilities in the Cisco platforms.\"I sincerely hope at least one expert will clue in the announcement-writer concerning the difference between a threat and a vulnerability.

A real false positive involves the IDS reporting \"cmd.exe\" when no such content passed on the wire.  Therefore, there are no such things as false positives.  Blame the signature writer or IDS developer, not the IDS.Let's move from the realm of IDS false positives to the land of canine false positives.  Yesterday the  issued its opinion in the case of .  This is a case where false positives involve a dog's ability to sniff for illegal drugs.   summarizes the facts of the case:\"Illinois State Police Trooper Daniel Gillette stopped Roy Caballes for driving 71 miles per hour in a zone with a posted speed limit of 65 miles per hour. Trooper Craig Graham of the Drug Interdiction Team heard on the radio that Trooper Gillette was making a traffic stop. Although Gillette requested no aid, Graham decided to come to the scene to conduct a dog sniff. Gillette informed Caballes that he was speeding and asked for the usual documents\u2013driver\u2019s license, car registration, and proof of insurance. Caballes promptly provided the requested documents but refused to consent to a search of his vehicle. After calling his dispatcher to check on the validity of Caballes\u2019 license and for outstanding warrants, Gillette returned to his vehicle to write Caballes a warning ticket. Interrupted by a radio call on an unrelated matter, Gillette was still writing the ticket when Trooper Graham arrived with his drug-detection dog. Graham walked the dog around the car, the dog alerted at Caballes\u2019 trunk, and, after opening the trunk, the troopers found marijuana.\" held that \"the dog sniff was performed on the exterior of respondent's car while he was lawfully seized for a traffic violation. Any intrusion on respondent's privacy expectations does not rise to the level of a constitutionally cognizable infringement... A dog sniff conducted during a concededly lawful traffic stop that reveals no information other than the location of a substance that no individual has any right to possess does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\"  In other words, it's ok for police to use dogs to inspect cars for drugs during traffic violation stops (or at other times), even if there is no suspicion of drugs involved.I do not agree with this opinion, for several reasons.  The first reason involves false positives, and was correctly diagnosed in :\"I would hold that using the dog for the purposes of determining the presence of marijuana in the car\u2019s trunk was a search unauthorized as an incident of the speeding stop and unjustified on any other ground...The infallible dog, however, is a creature of legal fiction... [T]heir supposed infallibility is belied by judicial opinions describing well-trained animals sniffing and alerting with less than perfect accuracy, whether owing to errors by their handlers, the limitations of the dogs themselves, or even the pervasive contamination of currency by cocaine...In practical terms, the evidence is clear that the dog that alerts hundreds of times will be wrong dozens of times.Once the dog\u2019s fallibility is recognized, however... the sniff alert does not necessarily signal hidden contraband, and opening the container or enclosed space whose emanations the dog has sensed will not necessarily reveal contraband or any other evidence of crime.\"Justice Ginsberg expresses the second reason for my disagreement.  Returning to her dissent, we see that beyond a Fourth Amendment violation, there are other problems with allowing canine searches prone to false positives:\"A drug-detection dog is an intimidating animal... Injecting such an animal into a routine traffic stop changes the character of the encounter between the police and the motorist. The stop becomes broader, more adversarial, and (in at least some cases) longer. Caballes \u2013- who, as far as Troopers Gillette and Graham knew, was guilty solely of driving six miles per hour over the speed limit -\u2013 was exposed to the embarrassment and intimidation of being investigated, on a public thoroughfare, for drugs...Under today\u2019s decision, every traffic stop could become an occasion to call in the dogs, to the distress and embarrassment of the law-abiding population...Today\u2019s decision... clears the way for suspicionless, dog-accompanied drug sweeps of parked cars along sidewalks and in parking lots... Nor would motorists have constitutional grounds for complaint should police with dogs, stationed at long traffic lights, circle cars waiting for the red signal to turn green.\"My third and final reason for disagreeing with the Court's opinion is based on .  He writes for the Court:\"We have held that any interest in possessing contraband cannot be deemed 'legitimate,' and thus, governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband 'compromises no legitimate privacy interest.'\"Now, what if the definition of contraband is extended beyond illegal drugs?  How about music or movies in digital form, or pirated software?  Is the Court opening the door to knock down privacy rights, since means to discover contraband do not infringe Fourth Amendment rights?  The Court continues:\"The legitimate expectation that information about perfectly lawful activity will remain private is categorically distinguishable from respondent\u2019s hopes or expectations concerning the nondetection of contraband in the trunk of his car.\"The Court also brushes aside the false positive concerns:\"Although respondent argues that the error rates, particularly the existence of false positives, call into question the premise that drug-detection dogs alert only to contraband, the record contains no evidence or findings that support his argument.\"I find this ruling very disturbing.  I expect to see canine units used in increasing numbers in the coming months, where false positives will continue to plague innocent people.  For example, yesterday  reported that a man carrying cash to close on his house purchase was arrested when a dog alerted to supposed traces of illegal drugs on the money.

The goal of this book is to help security architects and engineers control and instrument their networks, and help analysts investigate security events.  Extrusion Detection is a sequel to my first The Tao of Network Security Monitoring: Beyond Intrusion Detection.  Extrusion Detection explains how to engineer an organization's internal network to control and detect intruders launching client-side attacks.  Client-side attacks are more insidious than server-side attacks, because the intruder targets a vulnerable application anywhere inside a potentially hardened internal network.  A powerful means to detect the compromise of internal systems is to watch for outbound connections from the victim to systems on the Internet operated by the intruder.  Here we see the significance of the word \"extrusion\" in the book's title.  In addition to watching connections inbound from the Internet, we watch for suspicious activity exiting the protected network.Readers will learn theory, techniques, and tools to implement network security monitoring (NSM) for internal intrusions.  I have already received several case studies from - Interpreting Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) (port 139, 445 TCP) protocols- Microsoft's Network Access Protection (NAP)- Cisco's Network Admission Control (NAC) technologies.- 802.1x- VLANs and VLAN access control lists- Cisco Network Access Module and similar means to collect traffic on network hardware- Using FPGAs, network processors, or other non-libpcap methods to capture network traffic in high bandwidth environments- Using proxies to inspect and carry traffic from internal systems to the Internet -- the more exotic, the better- Any case studies involving compromise of internal systems, such as via VPN to partner networks, attaching rogue laptops, opening malicious email or visiting evil Web sites- Anything else you think would be cool to discuss in a book on controlling, detecting, and responding to internal threats -- as long as it doesn't appear in other books!If you have an idea you'd like to discuss, please email taosecurity at gmail dot com.

First, it's important to understand how your IDS works.  If you don't understand how it works, you're less likely to trust the alert data it generates.  If you don't trust IDS alerts, why are you collecting them?  Second, this stream implementation represents a trade-off between capability and performance.  Sensors are not built with unlimited ability to capture and reassemble traffic.  Anything you can do to make the traffic stream cleaner for your sensor, like , helps.Third, Marty demonstrates that the pseudopacket that Snort presents to an analyst may not be an actual packet that crossed the wire.  If an analyst wants to see exactly what passed by the sensor, she must turn to full content data collected independently of the alert data generation with Snort.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

The hacker asked the Secret Service informant for a proxy server -- a host that would pass through Web connections, making them harder to trace. The informant was happy to oblige. The proxy he provided, of course, was a Secret Service machine specially configured for monitoring, and agents watched as the hacker surfed to \"My T-Mobile,\" and entered a username and password belonging to Peter Cavicchia, a Secret Service cyber crime agent in New York.Cavicchia was the agent who last year spearheaded the investigation of Jason Smathers, a former AOL employee accused of stealing 92 million customer e-mail addresses from the company to sell to a spammer. The agent was also an adopter of mobile technology, and he did a lot of work through his T-Mobile Sidekick -- an all-in-one cellphone, camera, digital organizer and e-mail terminal. The Sidekick uses T-Mobile servers for e-mail and file storage, and the stolen documents had all been lifted from Cavicchia's T-Mobile account, according to the affidavit. (Cavicchia didn't respond to an e-mail query from SecurityFocus Tuesday.)By that time the Secret Service already had a line on Ethic's true identity. Agents had the hacker's ICQ number, which he'd used to chat with the informant. A Web search on the number turned up a 2001 resume for the then-teenaged Jacobsen, who'd been looking for a job in computer security. The e-mail address was listed as ethics@netzero.net.The trick with the proxy honeypot provided more proof of the hacker's identity: the server's logs showed that Ethics had connected from an IP address belonging to the Residence Inn Hotel in Buffalo, New York. When the Secret Service checked the Shadowcrew logs through a backdoor set up for their use -- presumably by the informant -- they found that Ethics had logged in from the same address. A phone call to the hotel confirmed that Nicolas Jacobsen was a guest.\"I strongly recommend reading the whole article for context, but the four italicized sections yield some interesting lessons:- Intruders: Don't trust proxies you don't own.  Don't post your resumes online.  Trust no one!- Agents: Don't store sensitive information on technology or services you don't control or thoroughly understand.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I am not upset because the author says his \"results indicate that NetBSD has surpassed FreeBSD in performance on nearly every benchmark and is poised to grab the title of the best operating system for the server environment.\"  I am disappointed that the author has decided to use his \"results\" in a divisive manner.  Rather than seek to learn from each BSD project and potentially compete better with Linux or Windows, George decides to drive a wedge between the NetBSD and FreeBSD communities.Regarding the nature of the delivery of this report, George demonstrates he apparently doesn't know how to use email.  Instead of posting his findings himself, he relies on  to post the abstract for the report in multiple newsgroups, like While I find Hubert's Regarding the \"results\" themselves, I found three responses interesting.  First,  points out that George's test results do not support his conclusions.  Stheg uses excerpts from George's paper to make his case.  Second,  explains the technical decisions behind FreeBSD's architecture.  Robert says:\"Regarding SMP or not -- the path the FreeBSD Project has taken (and this choice was before I was really all that involved, to be honest) was a re-architecture of the kernel to improve performance, scalability, and structure via a movement to a parallelizable, preemptible, threaded kernel.  I think this is the right architecture to move to, as it not only improves performance and scalability, but it also closes a lot of existing race conditions in the kernel that only became more exposed as threading and SMP became more predominant.  This has had a lot of performance benefits, but comes with initial costs that aren't all immediately offset by initial benefits.  Now that this model is largely adopted, we'll see a nice increase in benefits over time -- i.e., it was an investment.\"The third response comes from , who mentions the controversial nature of the \"There's a leap from 'NetBSD performs better in microbenchmarks' to 'NetBSD is a better-performing server' (macrobenchmarks often do not reflect the same performance characteristics as microbenchmarks, although of course they are influenced by them).\"I personally use whatever operating system best suits the project at hand.  For example, I prefer to use OpenBSD for firewalls and FreeBSD for general purpose servers.  I have plans for a NetBSD system to become a terminal server, since it supports an obscure piece of hardware on that box and the machine offers only 32 MB RAM.

Dru Lavigne made me aware of this work in her I found the sections describing UNIX history to be very informative and detailed.  The author makes the point that the BSD license supports technological transfer of software from the university to the commercial space, while the GPL was explicitly designed to inhibit technology transfer (pp 14, 18).  I was surprised to learn that early hardware vendors encouraged users to write their own software, and in many cases sold user-developed software.  Even more shocking was the revelation that the US government, now infected by Microsoft, mandated UNIX for all federal OS purchases in 1986!The first 64 pages form a coherent whole, but I stopped reading when they ended.  The next pages are a collection of trivia.  For example, the author claims that the UNIX 'dd' command is so named because its parameters (like 'if=/dev/zero') take the form of IBM JCL 'DD' commands (p 70).  These and other tidbits are best read during free moments, perhaps waiting for something to compile on a slow machine.I think this work could be expanded to a full book if the author explained FreeBSD history beyond the launch of 386BSD.

They could use Some (such as Macintosh devotees) believe the GUI was one of the great advancements in personal computing.  I agree as far as personal computing goes, but I believe the GUI should stay on the PC and away from servers.  A GUI invites trouble when it wrongly empowers administrators to use powerful and potentially exploitable Web and email clients.  Suddenly a user with administrator privileges can be hit by client-side attacks.  The best way to avoid such a situation is to not allow Web or email clients to run on servers, not simply improve the security of such programs.  I have seen Microsoft encourage users not to do so, but I do not see Windows administrators breaking this mind-set any time soon.  The GUI is an example of a feature that is not really needed to provide services to clients.  What client needs a server-side GUI to offer Web pages, carry email, or serve SQL queries?  If a Windows system could be installed without a GUI, we might see less successful exploitation of Windows systems.  Microsoft is taking a step in the right direction by providing tools to limit the services activate on its systems.  I would like to see Windows machines install no listening services by default, except for an OpenSSH-like remote administration client.  Then, using a wizard, administrators could add in the services they believe they need.  It would also be helpful for Microsoft servers to offer individual services on specific ports, and not group everything under the sun on a few well-known ports.  An administrator who can look at a port listing and know the meaning of seeing port X and Y, but not Z, is an empowered administrator.  Individual services on specific ports simplifies network-based access control and identification of rogue services.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "After reading PHK's  article, I wondered about the goals of the FreeBSD project.  I found them in the \"1.3.2 FreeBSD Project GoalsContributed by Jordan Hubbard.The goals of the FreeBSD Project are to provide software that may be used for any purpose and without strings attached. Many of us have a significant investment in the code (and project) and would certainly not mind a little financial compensation now and then, but we are definitely not prepared to insist on it. We believe that our first and foremost 'mission' is to provide code to any and all comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets the widest possible use and provides the widest possible benefit. This is, I believe, one of the most fundamental goals of Free Software and one that we enthusiastically support.That code in our source tree which falls under the GNU General Public License (GPL) or Library General Public License (LGPL) comes with slightly more strings attached, though at least on the side of enforced access rather than the usual opposite. Due to the additional complexities that can evolve in the commercial use of GPL software we do, however, prefer software submitted under the more relaxed BSD copyright when it is a reasonable option to do so.\"These appear to be unchanged since Compare those goals to \"Provide the best development platform possible.  Provide full source access to developers and users, including the ability to look at CVS tree changes directly. Integrate good code from any source with acceptable copyright (ISC or Berkeley style preferred, GPL acceptable as a last recourse but not in the kernel, NDA never acceptable). We want to make available source code that anyone can use for ANY PURPOSE, with no restrictions. We strive to make our software robust and secure, and encourage companies to use whichever pieces they want to...Pay attention to security problems and fix them before anyone else does. (Try to be the #1 most secure operating system).Greater integration of cryptographic software...Track and implement standards (ANSI, POSIX, parts of X/Open, etc.)Work towards a very machine independent source tree. Support as many different systems and hardware as feasible.Be as politics-free as possible; solutions should be decided on the basis of technical merit.Do not let serious problems sit unsolved.Provide a good cross compile/development platform.Import external packages with minimal modifications - making upgrading much easier. Also to submit back to the developers any changes made.Make a CDROM-based release approximately every six months, in particular to fund the project.\"OpenBSD's goals are much easier to read and understand compared to FreeBSD, and more accurately reflect the project's purpose.The \"The NetBSD Project provides a freely available and redistributable system that professionals, hobbyists, and researchers can use in whatever manner they wish.\"Further:\"Generally speaking, the NetBSD Project provides a well designed, stable, and fast BSD system, avoids encumbering licenses, provides a portable system, which runs on many hardware platforms, interoperates well with other systems, [and] conforms to open systems standards as much as is practical.\"NetBSD's goals appear to be the same as FreeBSD's.  Of these various sets of goals, I find OpenBSD's compelling and focused.  I encourage readers to visit the  page because they are explained more fully and link to further explanations.  I think it would be helpful to launch a new thread (similar to a recent one in , would be useful.

In the fall of 2000, the AFCERT sent me to Washington, DC to participate in the \"redesign\" of the Air Force enterprise network.  Over a three week period we were expected to create plans to revamp the whole Air Force communications and security architecture.  The new network was supposed to be running by June 2001.  Obviously this did not happen, although it was the launch of the \"One Air Force, One Network\" campaign.  The entire  (.pdf) issue of The core of the project involved several key ideas:- Server consolidation, particularly email- Network access consolidation, with bases having links through their major commands- An Air Force portal (\"my.AF\")The Air Force is still following their \"One Air Force, One Network\" plans.  You can see the Air Force CIO's September 2004 Many reactions (e.g., Regarding the implementation of a homogeneous infrastructure, I have a mixed opinion.  Standardization can be a force for good when it eases system configuration, deployment, and patching.  The question is, do the benefits of standardization outweigh the potential for thorough, widespread exploitation by a worm targeting standardized deployments?  For years I've advocated deploying redundant architecture, running alternate operating systems, to mitigate this fate.  If you want your Web site running IIS on Windows, have an Apache on UNIX backup ready.I would have been pleased to see the Air Force adopt a thin client strategy for its desktop users, preferably based on \"The Air Force endures about one network-based attack per week that successfully exploits new vulnerabilities, Gilligan said. 'There's some disruption and loss of capability,' he pointed out, noting that Air Force bases all over the world support the operations of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. 'We're spending more money patching and fixing than buying software,' said Gilligan. It's not unusual for patching of vulnerabilities to take months to complete, he said.\"So instead of taking a serious look at the root cause of its patching and exploitation costs (both financial and in mission impact), the Air Force sought a better deal from the vendor producing flawed software.  This is sad.  TechWorld's Ellen Messmer wrote \"The US Air Force has had enough of Microsoft's security problems. But rather than switch to an alternative, it has struck a deal with CEO Steve Ballmer for a specially configured version of Windows.\"  Will Microsoft sell this \"special version\" elsewhere, and if so, is the Air Force the guinea pig paying to develop this version?Had the Air Force decided to break away from Microsoft, the other services would have definitely taken notice.  In fact, corporate America would have taken notice.

There's a great  discussing a user's attempt to improve NFS performance.  One of Robert Watson's \"I think the first thing you want to do is to try and determine whether the problem is a link layer problem, network layer problem, or application (file sharing) layer problem. Here's where I'd start looking:(1) I'd first off check that there wasn't a serious interrupt problem on the box, which is often triggered by ACPI problems. Get the box to be as idle as possible, and then use vmstat -i or stat -vmstat to see if anything is spewing interrupts.(2) Confirm that your hardware is capable of the desired rates: typically this involves looking at whether you have a decent card (most if_em cards are decent), whether it's 32-bit or 64-bit PCI, and so on. For unidirectional send on 32-bit PCI, be aware that it is not possible to achieve gigabit performance because the PCI bus isn't fast enough, for example.(3) Next, I'd use a tool like netperf (see ports collection) to establish three characteristics: round trip latency from user space to user space (UDP_RR), TCP throughput (TCP_STREAM), and large packet throughput (UDP_STREAM). With decent boxes on 5.3, you should have no trouble at all maxing out a single gig-e with if_em, assuming all is working well hardware wise and there's no software problem specific to your configuration.(4) Note that router latency (and even switch latency) can have a substantial impact on gigabit performance, even with no packet loss, in part due to stuff like ethernet flow control. You may want to put the two boxes back-to-back for testing purposes.(5) Next, I'd measure CPU consumption on the end box -- in particular, use top -S and systat -vmstat 1 to compare the idle condition of the system and the system under load.If you determine there is a link layer or IP layer problem, we can start digging into things like the error statistics in the card, negotiation issues, etc. If not, you want to move up the stack to try and characterize where it is you're hitting the  performance issue.\"Richard Blum's book , which I read and Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

While an HT Technology\u2013enabled processor doesn't equal the computing power of two physical processors, performance can be boosted with very little increase in cost and power consumption.

( when I installed FreeBSD 5.2 on the same system.Rather than wipe out my existing software installation, I bought a new 2.5 laptop hard drive.  Whenever I decide to reinstall an operation system from scratch on an important system, I usually buy a new hard drive and place the old one in a safe place.  Hard drives are very cheap compared to the data on them.  Although I do back up my data to other systems, you never know what you might need off the old hard drive.  I usually forget some item in the boot loader or some configuration script, neither of which are found in /home.My typical partitioning strategy is a variation of the following:/        2048 MBswap     twice RAM/usr     4096 MB/var     10240 MB/home    1024 MB (more for workstations, enough for servers)/tmp     1024 MB/nsm     remainder (if needed)That strategy works well on a 20 GB HDD, which is comfortable in today's computing world.When I installed FreeBSD 5.3, I didn't install any packages beyond the defaults.  I didn't see bash3 in the list of available packages in the /stand/sysinstall menu, so I decided I would add that later.

While many FreeBSD developers compile the FreeBSD-CURRENT source code daily, there are periods of time when the sources are not buildable. These problems are resolved as expeditiously as possible, but whether or not FreeBSD-CURRENT brings disaster or greatly desired functionality can be a matter of which exact moment you grabbed the source code in!\"In other words, CURRENT is where active, cutting-edge development is done.  Nobody should really run CURRENT on production machines because there is no guarantee it will work, due to dynamic code developments.Contrast CURRENT with \"FreeBSD-STABLE is our development branch from which major releases are made. Changes go into this branch at a different pace, and with the general assumption that they have first gone into FreeBSD-CURRENT for testing. This is still a development branch, however, and this means that at any given time, the sources for FreeBSD-STABLE may or may not be suitable for any particular purpose. It is simply another engineering development track, not a resource for end-users.\"STABLE is much more \"settled\" than CURRENT.  Radical design changes don't appear in STABLE, but features developed in CURRENT might be merged from CURRENT (mfc'd) from time to time.On production servers I prefer to track the so-called \"security\" branch, which is a RELEASE plus security fixes.Finally, a RELEASE is what you can download in .iso form or buy on a CD.  RELEASE is in some senses a version of STABLE judged to be ready for cutting to CD.  RELEASE is what you install on a new system.  You should then upgrade that RELEASE system to the \"security\" branch, which incorporates patches.Another way to think about these different versions is to consider how to reference them via :HEAD is CURRENT, or the 6.x treeRELENG_5 is now STABLERELENG_5_3 is the \"security\" branch for 5.3RELENG_5_3_0 is the 5.3 RELEASE, just as you might get on CDAt some point I may write a comprehensive article on all the ways to keep FreeBSD up-to-date.

        "content": "For my testing of  before it's available as a RELEASE, I decided to work on dual-booting it with Windows 2000.  I did not want to use any third-party boot loaders unless absolutely necessary.  I preferred to use the FreeBSD boot loader as FreeBSD is the primary OS on my Thinkpad a20p.  Unfortunately, I could not figure out a way to overcome the different ways Windows and FreeBSD see disk geometry while using the FreeBSD boot loader.  The following describes how to dual-boot FreeBSD 5.3 and Windows 2000 with Windows in the Master Boot Record handling boot selection.  I found these First I installed Windows 2000 in a 7427 MB C: partition, formatted as NTFS.  I also created a 30727 MB D: partition to hold FreeBSD, although I only let the Windows installation process create the partition and nothing more.  Next I began the FreeBSD installation process using a CD-ROM.  When it came time to partition the drive I saw this message:WARNING: A geometry of 77520/16/63 for ad0 is incorrect.Using a more likely geometry.  If this geometry is incorrector you are unsure as to whether or not it's correct, pleaseconsult the Hardware Guide in the Documentation menu or usethe (G)eometry command to change it now.Remember: you need to entry whatever your BIOS thinks thegeometry is!  For IDE, it's what you were told in the BIOSsetup.  For SCSI, it's the translation mode your controlleris using.  Do NOT use a \"physical geometry.\"I hit 'ok' and continue to the partition menu.  I deleted the partition identified by FreeBSD as ad0s2 \"extended DOS, LBA\" (the D: drive created while installing Windows) and created a FreeBSD partition.  Crucially, I set the Bootable flag on ad0s1 which held the NTFS partition for Windows 2000.When asked how to handle the MBR, I chose to Leave the Master Boot Record untouched.  This preserved the Windows code in the MBR.  Because Windows knew of another partition (originally D:) I believed the boot loader show know how to find the new FreeBSD partition in the same location.After that I proceeded with the regular FreeBSD installation tasks of creating /, /usr, and so on.  When done I rebooted and found myself again in Windows 2000.  At this point Windows is not aware of FreeBSD and one cannot access the FreeBSD installation without a boot disk.I inserted the FreeBSD installation CD-ROM and copied the boot/boot1 file to a new file called c:\\freebsd.  I then modified the c:\\boot.ini file by running 'notepad c:\\boot.ini'.  You cannot find this file with 'Search' or via Explorer as it is hidden from normal view.I added the following at the very end of the boot.ini file:c:\\freebsd=\"FreeBSD 5.3 REL\"After saving changes I rebooted Windows.  The next time Windows appeared I had the choice of booting Windows 2000 or FreeBSD 5.3-REL.

        "content": "One of the regulars in the #snort-gui IRC channel of irc.freenode.net asked me the following question via email.  This is an excerpt, and my response follows:\"I am very interested to hear your insight on the topic of 'incident containment' via TCP resets... I am concerned about whether or not incident containment should even be used. From a purely technical standpoint it seems like 'Sure, it's better than just leaving the connection live. It's helping to interfere, after-all.'But when I think about it in a real-world application, it seems like many malicious hackers will notice TCP resets as a clear sign they have been spotted. It seems like this understanding on their part will cause them to attempt to shoot in again even if only for the brief seconds required to 'rm -rf /'.The alternative, no TCP resets, it seems the intruder will most likely think their presence is yet unknown and they may be content with their backdoor...I guess the overall idea is in some ways it seems safer to -not- implement 'incident containment' via TCP resets. If their access is limited to a lower level user access or something then sure TCP resets may be great in preventing them from escalating their privs further, but if they have gained root/admin access it seems very dangerous to try such an ad-hoc method of temporary containment.Are TCP resets effective enough to prevent last-ditch efforts at wiping a machine?\"This is a good question.  I will frame my answer using the concepts in .  Let's start by describing a scenario.  You're performing network security monitoring, and your sensor generates alert data indicating the compromise of your Web server.   You check your session data and realize the intruder has connected to a back door installed as part of the initial exploit.  Reviewing your full content data, you see the intruder has root level access on the target.  (If the full content data were encrypted, preventing useful review of the back door communications, I would assume root level access anyway.)  The question at this point is \"what now?\"  Your level of situational awareness is good, since you know the intrusion attempt succeeded and the intruder has control of the target.  (If you were not following NSM principles and were not collecting alert, session, and full content data using something like If you're running a In this scenario, we saw the method of entry and its effects.  If we value learning the intruder's ultimate goal (vandalism, espionage, theft, etc.), we should not interfere with his back door.  This is very risky, especially if we see credit card databases transferred to Russia while we sit and watch the intruder.  If we value recovering the security of the target, we should definitely cut off the intruder's access.  In the case I described, I would immediately implement Short Term Incident Containment (STIC) to deny further intruder access (more on how shortly).In a different scenario, we might stumble upon an indicator that a victim is compromised, without knowledge of the initial point of entry.  For example, a review of our statistical NSM data could show an increase in ICMP traffic.  Closer review of full content data shows the ICMP traffic does not meet normal standards and is indicative of an ICMP-based back door.  Learning of an intrusion in progress is more common than seeing an intrusion from start to finish, in my incident response consulting experience.In a case where we do not know how the intruder gained access, or how many targets he has compromised, we would probably value intelligence gathering over containment.  In other words, we might let the intruder maintain access so as to determine his modus operandi and what other systems he has compromised.  Once we have a sense of the scope of the compromise, we might then institute STIC.The original question mentioned 'TCP resets.'  These are a way for a sensor to spoof reset traffic to fool the source and destination hosts into thinking they each want to end an active connection.  This technique is offered as a way for a sensor sitting off-line to interrupt an intrusion attempt.  I've used this technique since 1998 and I can report it is not foolproof for a variety of reasons.  TCP resets should be used as a last-ditch STIC method.The best way to limit an intruder's manueverability is to use an access control device.  This is best done with a true firewall, although stateful router ACLs can be applied as well.  Sometimes a target will be cut off from the outside world after an attack, and then reconnected with special access control measures taken to limit an intruder's manueverability.  This is called \"fishbowling\" a target.As for whether an intruder will try to quickly destroy a target to eliminate evidence: I never consider this when making the deny/allow decision.  You've got to decide whether you value information about the threat or controlling the threat.  I follow the rule that it is unwise to 'hack back' or otherwise touch intruders, since I don't want to tip off intruders that I've seen their activities.  (Some consider deterrence a valid goal of NSM operations, and there is evidence that the Air Force had the best results deterring intruders due to its vigilance.  I don't think the same applies to the commercial world because .gov is more willing to pursue and prosecute than .com or .edu.)  I consider shutting down remote access and thereby alerting the intruder a necessary step when the victim values controlling the threat.Any time an intruder has root level access, the situation should be immediately considered extremely poor.  The only mitigating factor is the level of knowledge you have of the intruder's activity on the target.  If your NSM operation has complete awareness of the intruder's actions, you may recover without completely rebuilding the target.  If you have any doubt as to what actions the intruder may have taken on the target, I recommend a complete rebuild from trusted sources.I talk more about STIC, the decision to watch intruders, and related issues in my Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Hotfix support that is not security-related requires a separate extended hotfix support contract to be purchased within 90 days after mainstream support ends.

He explained how it has been traditionally difficult to prosecute juvenlile offenders in federal court.

This means that, on average, organizations have less than a week to patch all their systems on which the vulnerable application is running.Over the first six months of 2004, the number of monitored bots rose from well under 2,000 computers to more than 30,000.Over the first six months of 2004, Symantec observed worm traffic originating from Fortune 100 corporations.  This data was gathered not by monitoring the Fortune 100 companies themselves, but by analyzing attack data that revealed the source IP addresses of attack activity. The purpose of this analysis was to determine how many of these systems were infected by worms and actively being used to propagate worms. More than 40% of Fortune 100 companies controlled IP addresses from which worm-related attacks propagated.In the first half of 2004, 39% of disclosed vulnerabilities were associated with Web application technologies.Symantec expects that recent Linux and BSD vulnerabilities that have been discovered and used in proof-of-concept exploits will be used as exploit-based worms in the near future.[Regarding appliances like SOHO routers, firewalls, and VPN endpoints,] as technical details of these devices have become public, attackers have modified the firmware to provide internal access and even allow attackers to monitor traffic on the network.\"I recommend downloading and perusing the whole report.The  report confirmed a few of my opinions.  For example, it seems the idea of a \"return on investment\" (ROI) for security still doesn't convince managers to pay for security:\"Negative factors (such as fear of litigation) remained the primary drivers of security spending. Positive factors (such as contributing to business objectives) were less common.\"Paying for security is like buying insurance.  Security is an exercise in cost avoidance.  There is little or no \"return\" on an \"investment\" in security.  Paying to prevent or mitigate intrusions as the money spent is not an \"investment.\"In short, the \"six secrets\" were:1. Spend more2. Separate information security from IT3. Conduct a penetration test4. Create a comprehensive risk assessment process5. Define your overall security architecture6. Establish a quarterly review processCIO should have included a seventh step:7. Maintain network and threat awarenessThe risk equation is:Risk = Threats X Vulnerabilities X Asset ValueCurrently security folks spend time on vulnerabilities and assets, but hardly any on threats.  How did this happen?Organizations began their security evolution by looking at vulnerabilities, which launched the \"vulnerability management\" craze.  At first every piece of infrastructure was considered \"critical,\" which meant nothing was truly important.  Once asset value was taken into account, assets were prioritized and vulnerabilities in the most critical assets were addressed first via patch management, access control, and other countermeasures.  This process encompasses steps 3-6 above.Unfortunately, far too many security experts ignore the third element of the risk equation -- threats.  Of course there are vulnerability correlation product, not a \"threat correlation module.\"So how does an organization acquire the third piece of the risk equation -- threats?  The answer is monitoring.  I advocate network security monitoring, which is \"the collection, analysis, and escalation of indications and warnings to detect and respond to intrusions.\"  Only by acquiring network awareness, primarily through monitoring for suspicious and malicious activity, can one identify and assess threats.  Why spend time, people, and equipment securing a vulnerability in SNMP, for example, if hardly anyone is seeking to exploit it?Until more of the security world realizes that network awareness is just as important as enumerating vulnerabilities and prioritizing assets, the adversary will have the upper hand.If you'd like to know more about this sort of thinking, chapter 1 of  addresses the threat equation, defines its components, and offers other commentary.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I recently received the following email:\"I have been reading your book on The Tao of NSM. I am an amateur but very interested in the subject.  My only issue is that I am very uncomfortable with your bias against Windows and for the OpenSoftware. [sic]  In our market, 95% of the desktops and 55% of the servers are Windows.  We do not want to be caught in the emotional battle of OS.  Any chance you can recommend a Windows zealot that is as good with the NSM subject as you are?\"This is an interesting question, as I directly address my sentiments on operating systems in chapter 3 of my book.  I was also \"quoted\" on Several factors drive my personal preference for UNIX, or more specifically, FreeBSD-based sensors.  Some are personal and some are universal.  Many places where BSD appears, Linux and in some cases Mac OS X also applies.1.  Platform Security:  One of the primary responsibilities of a security professional is to avoid introducing additional vulnerabilities while deploying people, processes, and products to improve security.  The Hippocratic Oath, \"First, do no harm,\" applies.  I am not confident that a Windows system can defend itself on the Internet.  Configuring a Windows system such that it can operate independently, outside of the protection of a firewall, is not easy.  I can quickly disable all services except OpenSSH on a FreeBSD or OpenBSD platform, and not need a host-based firewall.  With Windows, unless I deploy a host-based firewall, it is .  Furthermore,  pales in comparison to 2. Network Performance: Aside from the work of people like  and the ), and other platforms deployed on FreeBSD specifically for the robustness of its TCP/IP stack and network performance.  On the Linux side work done by  and  also point to specific network performance enhancements.  One of the primary reasons to deploy a sensor is to collect traffic, and no one ever cites traffic collection capabilities as a strength of Windows.3. Ease of Deployment: Many assume Windows must be the easier OS to deploy since it uses a GUI.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  GUIs are helpful because they tend to put options in front of the user in menu format.  CLIs tend to be difficult because the user must know what series of commands and options must be passed to accomplish a given task.  Once the CLI is understood, however, it is easier to accurately replicate and track the actions taken on a CLI system.  How does one run Beyond the GUI vs CLI, I believe the UNIX model and especially the BSD's OS installation process to be much more suited for building sensors.  For example, it is trivial to deploy a very stripped down FreeBSD or OpenBSD sensor using built-in installation options.  Fanatics are free to go the extra mile to remove tools in preselected packages, but that is not always necessary.  Even deploying the most minimal Windows system still installs a graphical subsystem as part of the Windows kernel.  4. System Administration:  I think it is easier to administer BSD or UNIX systems in general.  I can do everything I need over OpenSSH, which is installed on the OS (unlike OpenSSH added to a Windows box).  I can use OpenSSH over a low bandwidth link if necessary, unlike Terminal Services (VNC is another matter, but is again an add-on).  I can check critical configuration files into  for Windows, giving easy access to almost 12,000 applications.5. Diverse Tools: Most of the tools in my book are UNIX-based because the majority of network security monitoring tools were developed by UNIX programmers.  Besides the other four reasons given, this one is a major reason why I know of no \"Windows zealot that is as good with the NSM subject\" as me.  Commercial tools exist, but with ever tighter security budgets I don't see many enterprises having the money to buy them.  Open source is more than free -- it's also the power to change tools that don't do what you want.  Although I don't see the value in Web-based alert browsers like  (BASE) could fork the ACID code base to continue development of that tool.  Such innovation is just not possible with proprietary tools.These are the reasons I am an open source advocate and user.  I know of several very smart people working for Microsoft and this critique is not intended to attack them.  However, I am more confident that my BSD-based security appliances will do the job they were built for, and not become a liability when I deploy them.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I would love to implement Am I missing something with regards to how Snort stores data in this kind of scenario, or do I really need to plan for that much disk space?\"This is a good question, and it is a common initial response to learning about Network Security Monitoring (NSM).  Remember that NSM is defined as \"the collection, analysis, and escalation of indications and warning to detect and respond to intrusions.\"  There is no explicit mention of collecting every packet that traverses the network in that defintion.  However, NSM analysts find that the best way to accomplish the detection of and response to intrusions is by interpreting alert, session, full content, and statistical network evidence.  Simply moving \"beyond intrusion detection\" (my book's subtitle) -- beyond reliance on alert data alone -- moves one away from traditional \"IDS\" and towards NSM.The answer for those operating in high bandwidth requirements is collect what you can.  Chapter 2 (- Detection through sampling is better than no detection.- Detection through traffic analysis is better than no detection.- Collecting everything is ideal but problematic.  I recommend looking at Chapter 2 for more information on these principles.Someone monitoring a data center uplink or an Internet backbone is not going to collect meaningful amounts of full content data without spending a lot of money on high-end hardware and potentially custom software.  You may only be able to collect small amounts of full content data in response to specific problems like identification of a covert back door.  You may have to take a cue from There is nothing wrong with either approach.  The idea is to give your analysts as much supporting information as possible when they need to make a decision concerning suspicious or malicious traffic.  Only giving them an alert, with no other context or non-judgement based data, makes it very unlikely the analyst will know how to make an informed validation and escalation decision.My specific answer for the question at hand would be to try deploying Sguil with a conservative full content collection strategy.  Pass BPF filters in the log_packets.sh script to limit the full content data collected on the sensor.  Additionally, if you find the amount of session data logged by If at all possible I advise not filtering SANCP and other session collection mechanisms, as these content-neutral collection measures can really save you in an incident response scenario.  If SANCP and database inserts are a problem, consider the more mature code base of Update: My buddy Bamm Visscher points out that a sustained 5 Mbps throughput is 2250 MB per hour or 54000 MB per day in raw traffic.  However, some overhead is needed for libpcap headers.  For small packets, the header could be as large as the content, effectively doubling the disk space needed to record that packet.  For large packets, the header is a smaller percentage of the overall record of the packet.Anectdotal evidence from one of Bamm's friends says a link with sustained 10 Mbps is writing about 8 GB per hour to disk.  Speaking conservatively for the original question of 5 Mbps, a sensor like a Dell PowerEdge 750 with two 250 GB SATA drives can hold at least several days worth of libpcap data, and potentially up to a week.  That's plenty of time to retrieve useful full content data if regular monitoring is done.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "It struck me today that Senator Kennedy's  are very similar to our digital security woes.  Recently Kennedy said \"he was stopped and questioned at airports on the East Coast five times in March because his name appeared on the government's secret 'no-fly' list.\"  The Washington Post reported \"a senior administration official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said Kennedy was stopped because the name 'T. Kennedy' has been used as an alias by someone on the list of terrorist suspects.\"  \"T. Kennedy\" reminds me of a content matching IDS rule.  Is this a \"false positive\"?  If you consider that airline personnel were making decisions based on the rules they were given -- stop anyone using the name \"T. [Ted, in the senator's case] Kennedy,\" this is not a false positive.  Perhaps with more context, like personal recognition that the individual at hand is one of the most famous members of the US Senate, the airline \"IDS\" would meet more of the \"spirit\" of its mission and less its \"letter.\" How did Senator Kennedy handle being flagged when he checked into the airport?  According to the Post, \"When the senator checked in at the counter, airline employees told him they could not issue him a boarding pass because he appeared on the list. Kennedy was delayed until a supervisor could be summoned to identify him and give approval for him to board the plane.\"  That process reminds me of an investigation by a human analyst.  Luckily the analyst had the information he or she needed to make a decision.  The \"full content data\" in the person of Senator Kennedy allowed the decision maker to realize the senator was not a terrorist.  Without that data, say only knowing someone named \"T. Kennedy\" was on board a flight, the decision maker might not be able to take proper defensive actions.What is better: (1) removing a \"bad signature\" (\"T. Kennedy\"), or (2) relying on a scrap of imprecise information that could potentially identify a serious threat?  With all of this case's publicity, it's doubtful any terrorist will use that alias again.  Whatever your decision, this case reminds security professionals to collect  the information analysts need to transform indicators into warnings.  Also, don't blame the identification system for making poor decisions if you feed it imprecise signatures.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "Perhaps \"fascinating\" is too strong a word, but I've come across several intriguing government reports and documents which security professionals might find interesting.  First, the  released a joint report titled . It's based on \"23 incidents carried out by 26 insiders in the banking and finance sector between 1996 and 2002. Organizations affected by insider activity in this sector include credit unions, banks, investment firms, credit bureaus, and other companies whose activities fall within this sector. Of the 23 incidents, 15 involved fraud, four involved theft of intellectual property, and four involved sabotage to the information system/network.\"  One of the incidents, mentioned in the beginning of the report, was the case prosecuted by the DoJ on behalf of The major findings include:\"- Most of the incidents in the banking and finance sector were not technically sophisticated or complex. They typically involved the exploitation of non-technical vulnerabilities such as business rules or organization policies (rather than vulnerabilities in an information system or network) by individuals who had little or no technical expertise. In 87% of the cases the insiders employed simple, legitimate user commands to carry out the incidents, and in 78% of the incidents, the insiders were authorized users with active computer accounts.- The majority of the incidents (81%) were devised and planned in advance. Furthermore, in most cases, others had knowledge of the insider's intentions, plans, and/or activities. Those who knew were often directly involved in the planning or stood to benefit from the activity.- Most insiders (81%) were motivated by financial gain, rather than a desire to harm the company or information system.- Insiders in this report fit no common profile. Only 23% held a technical position, 13% had a demonstrated interest in  hacking  and 27% had come to the attention of a supervisor or co-worker prior to the incident.- Insider incidents were detected by internal, as well as external, individuals   including customers.- The impact of nearly all insider incidents in the banking and finance sector was financial loss for the victim organization: in 30% of the cases the financial loss exceeded $500,000. Many victim organizations incurred harm to multiple aspects of the organization.- Most of the incidents (83%) were executed physically from within the insider's organization and took place during normal business hours.\"The report also cites a 2000 study titled \"DoD Insider Threat Mitigation,\" available in threats, not vulnerabilities.  I am always pleased when I see organizations working with law enforcement to prosecute intruders.  A new firewall is not going to stop future intrusions; putting criminals in jail will.  Don't focus on the vulnerability and forget about the threat!On the .mil side, I came across fairly new documents from the Air Force describing their new network operations and security posture.  It seems after four years of debate the dust is settling around a hierarchical structure led by the Air Force Network Operations and Security Center (AFNOSC).  Several Air Force Instructions (AFIs), led by  \"Network Operations (NETOPS)\" (3 May 04) and other  have redefined the relationship between the AFNOSC and the Air Force network.  While the new structure looks good, I was sad to see the name \"AFCERT\" officially be replaced by \"AFNOSC Network Security Division.\"  I understand the desire to give the AFCERT the authority of being AFNOSC-NSD, but the AFCERT name has twelve years of history behind it.  My friends still in the AFCERT report they still use the old name and plan to do so.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": " is a review of \"Internet Security Systems (ISS) Proventia G200, Lancope StealthWatch 4.0, Snort 2.10, and StillSecure Border Guard 4.3.\"  I think they meant \"Snort 2.1.0.\"  Already you might suspect I have problems with this first article, which was done at the  in Monterey, CA.  My major concerns with product reviews of this sort is their focus on alert-centric intrusion detection at the expense of other forms of network security monitoring data.  Session, full content, and statistical data are completely ignored.  Most reviews judge products primarily on their capability to identify \"attacks,\" which in this case included \"both live Internet traffic and a variety of attacks we launched from penetration testing tool .\"When an attack is launched, the IDS is judged to be \"good\" if it blinks its red light, and \"bad\" if the light stays dark.  No mention is made of the analyst's capability to perform true incident analysis or the ability to determine how the product made its detection decision.  The review stops with attack detection and does not consider the ability to track the intruder beyond the event which triggered an alert, let alone looking for non-alert evidence of prior intruder activity.  All reviewers also include a caveat like this: \"Its [Snort's] main weakness is its dependence on (sometimes poor) signatures. As with all signature-based IDSes, Snort can be defenseless against unknown or 'zero-day' attacks until a signature becomes available.\"Unfortunately, dealing with events for which there is no signature or anomaly is the primary problem with all detection products.  I believe that administrators should deploy network audit devices that detect failures in protection as well as keep records of all network activity, within the bounds set by legal, technical, and administrative policies.  Products which focus on detecting \"attacks\" are merely documenting possible exploitation events.  They are most useful against well-defined events like worm outbreaks but nearly worthless for incident scoping against rogue insiders, stealthy intruders, and unknown exploit techniques.I was pleased to see some discussion of true enhancements to detection capabilities in the review.  Areas like active asset discovery, vulnerability correlation, and passive mapping only make the analyst's job easier.  These \"contextuals\" (as Marty says) give the analyst a better idea of his defensive landscape and should receive more attention in future IDS reviews.The areas covered by popular IDS reviews which do matter (to a lesser degree) are those that make life easier for the administrator and analyst.  These include sensor deployment, rule management, and reporting.  Reports on these features (especially installation) remind me of nearly every Linux review published; most people want to know if the installer is an X application or a series of text-based instructions.  Because it's hard for most people to judge the power of a new scheduler or the network capture improvements of device polling, reviewers spend their time on other matters.Sguil users know sensor deployment, rule management, and reporting are lacking in our tool, but we are working on each.  Sguil 0.5.2, for example, features new reporting features courtesy of Steve Halligan.  Editor Steve Fox wrote the second interesting article, , subtitled \"There's a reason you need intrusion detection systems.\"  The article ends in a light-hearted discussion of the funny names attached to many open source products:\"Snort creator Martin Roesch \u2014 founder of security pioneer Sourcefire and an InfoWorld 2004 Innovator \u2014 confirmed our suspicions about the open source crowd in a post-test conversation. ACID, he confided, is on its way out as the preferred Snort GUI, soon to be replaced by SGUIL. And what does that stand for? Snort Graphical User Interface for Losers, of course.That\u2019s a winner in our book.\"While that makes for a cute story, Sguil users know the \"L\" doesn't stand for \"Losers.\"  When I contacted Steve by email, he graciously offered to publish a reply from the Sguil team.  Bamm decided to roll with the tone of the article and not publish a correction.  I ask all Sguil users and potential users to not take such articles too seriously, and let our tools speak for themselves.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Reading from the , we find the following:\"FedLine is the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s proprietary electronic delivery channel for financial institution access to Federal Reserve financial services, and includes DOS-based FedLine and FedLine for the Web.  FedLine for the Web is available to financial institutions for access to financial services deemed low-risk by the Federal Reserve but does not currently offer access to high-risk payment-related applications such as funds transfer.\" (emphasis added) documents differentiate between the existing  by a former  staffer explains the NY Post FUD:\"The Fed is not going to be transferring money over the Internet. Clearing and settlement will continue to take place over dedicated, leased, secured IP lines or in data centers with military-level security.The change being made is how individual commercial banks interface with the computers at the Fed in order in initiate wire transfers and transmit data for bulk transaction processing. FedLine for the Web is a great improvement over the MS-DOS-based systems that are currently in use for small and medium-sized banks. Through these systems, banks do a variety of things, including initiate wire transfers, check intraday overdraft balances, submit batch files for overnight ACH payments processing, and many others.\"I find the NY Post article interesting because the writer, Hilary Kramer, emailed to ask my opinion on the issue.  Now that I have some background concerning the Fed's move, I know what she meant by \"the Fed moving to the Internet with its money transfers.\"  There's a big difference between a system which allows financial institutions to essentially perform online banking and a system used for settlement and clearing!It may be easier to disrupt a Web-based system, since anyone in the world with Internet connectivity can potentially connect to the new \"FedLine for the Web.\"  It's slightly more difficult (and costly) to dial-up the target Fed system, and preserving anonymity is also tougher when making phone calls.  I found the comments by a Fed spokesperon interesting:\"Patti Lorenzen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve, said the agency is taking every precaution.  'Of course, we will not discuss the specifics of our security measures for obvious reasons,' she said. 'We feel confident that this system adheres to the highest standards of security. Without disclosing the specifics, it is important to note that our security controls include authentication, encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection and Federal Reserve conducted reviews.'\" (emphasis added)I highlight the last two points for different reasons.  Regarding intrusion detection, I like seeing people tasked with important security decisions still speaking of intrusion detection and not \"intrusion prevention,\" since prevention fails and the \"IPS\" is a marketing invention.  (An IPS is a layer 7 firewall.)  On the Fed conducting \"reviews,\" I hope these assessments are done by independent third parties.  If the same group who designed the system is auditing it, the Fed is setting themselves up for a fall by violating an important security principle.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Mateias, if charged in a U.S. court, could get up to 90 years in prison and fined to repay Ingram Micro as well as other damages.

Unless you're a member of the core team, you'll find enough tricks and tips to make BSD Hacks a welcome addition to your system administration library.\"Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I found that I could create and save a presentation in .sxi format, only to have OOo not able to open it.  I lost several hours worth of work due to this flaw.  I was unable to open several .sxi files built with OOo 1.1.1 on FreeBSD, and was unable to get OOo 1.1.1 on Fedora Core 2 or OOo 1.1.2 on Windows 2000 to read the problematic .sxi either.  I dealt with this in two ways.  First, I chopped up my presentation into eight smaller files.  This limited the damage in the event some slide became corrupt and prevented access to the rest of the presentation.  Second, I saved every presentation in .sxi and .ppt formats.  That way I could try opening the presentation in PowerPoint if OOo decided not to read the file it just saved.I made use of the built-in bug reporting on OOo on FC2 to send a message to the OOo team.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

For the past few weeks CERT and SEI, DoD government funded organizations, have been purchasing google adwords so that when people search for \"SANS Training\" they see an advertisement for CERT/SEI's network manager course.I have a couple of concerns about this.  The first is trademark or brand related, when you search for SANS training, you should get SANS training.  Other competing commercial training companies have also engaged in this behavior and when I have written them and asked if this how they want to be remembered by the security community, they have discontinued this practice.  I wrote cert@cert.org a couple weeks ago and they continue this practice.My second concern is that the government offering the course violates the spirit and letter of OMB A 76. \"Two of the key principles of Circular A-76 has always been that \"in the process of governing, the Government should not compete with its citizens\" and that \"a commercial activity is not a governmental function.\"The course:The funding:My third concern is the amount of tax we pay as citizens.  The government is in the process of authorizing about 481 billion dollars for DoD spending.  The Department of Defense clearly has too much money if they can afford to create training that mirrors material widely available from SANS, MISTI, CSI, Intense School and other training organizations.  I believe the money spent on CERT, SEI and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics should each be reduced by at least 10% immediately. So I am asking for your help.  If you agree with me please write your congress person and either use this note as a base or write your own. I would be honored if you would copy me, Stephen@sans.org.  If you don't agree with me, or don't want to help me, that is fine, but before you send me a knee jerk email flame would you do three things.  Look at your last paycheck stub and remind yourself how much tax you pay, second, consider the impact of the U.S. deficit ( ) and finally think about how you would feel if the government decided to compete in a disreputable manner with a course that took you months to write, SANS Security Leadership. After that, if you disagree with me, I would love to hear what you have to say.  So please help me and write your congressman and tell them your home address, make sure they know you vote and you agree that the government has no business wasting taxpayer money competing with a course Stephen Northcutt does a better job of anyway.To find your representative:To find your congressional representative, the best link I could find is:Thank you for taking the time to help!  Needless to say, I write this note as a private citizen and the author of SANS Security Leadership and am certain this note does not reflect the collective views and opinions of The SANS Institute.Stephen NorthcuttStephen@sans.org(808) 823-1375\"This sounds like a hoax to me... can anyone confirm it?  \"...make sure they know you vote and you agree that the government has no business wasting taxpayer money competing with a course Stephen Northcutt does a better job of anyway.\"  If this is a true statement by Stephen, I'd be surprised.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "I needed to become familiar with burning CDs on FreeBSD to support plans for live CD-based systems.  I recently bought a  DVD+-R/RW CD-R/RW drive and an .  I already For testing purposes and to create my own media set, I duplicated the three CD-ROMs released as .  To convert the CD-ROM into a .iso file for burning, I used this syntax:dd if=/dev/cd0 of=/var/iso/fedora_core_disc3.iso bs=2048Here's a few notes on this command.  /dev/cd0 is how my Plextor drive appears to FreeBSD.  My laptop's native CD/DVD reader is /dev/acd0.  I could not get this command to work without including 'bs=2048'.  I learned why after reading a  entry:\"Data on CDs is written in blocks of 2 kB. By default dd reads 512bytes at a time, and the CD driver doesn't support this. It wouldwork if you use bs=2k.\"When I tried dd without the bs=2048 argument, I got this error:dd: /dev/acd0: Invalid argumentI also tried acquiring the .iso using my native CD/DVD reader.  I got this error, although the .iso creation seemed to work ok:acd0: FAILURE - READ_BIG status=51 sensekey=ILLEGAL REQUEST error=1Others have  this issue, and some suggested editing /boot/loader.conf accordingly:hw.ata.atapi_dma=0This didn't fix the issue for me, so I acquired the .iso using the Plextor.  It produced no visible errors.When the process was done I wanted to check if the resulting .iso matched the CD from which it was derived.  From  I learned this command to get a MD5 hash of the original CD:dd if=/dev/cd0 bs=2048 | md5I then compared that output with the result of running md5 on this .iso.  If they matched, the copy was good.  This was the case.  However, the MD5 hashes did not match the versions available at the To burn the new .iso to CD-R, I had to install # cdrecord -scanbusCdrecord 2.00.3 (i386-unknown-freebsd5.2.1) Copyright (C) 1995-2002 Jorg SchillingUsing libscg version 'schily-0.7'scsibus0:        0,0,0     0) 'PLEXTOR ' 'DVDR   PX-708A  ' '1.06' Removable CD-ROM        0,1,0     1) *        0,2,0     2) *        0,3,0     3) *        0,4,0     4) *        0,5,0     5) *        0,6,0     6) *        0,7,0     7) *Once I knew where to find the drive, I checked what options it supported:# cdrecord -v dev=0,0,0 -checkdrive driveropts=helpCdrecord 2.00.3 (i386-unknown-freebsd5.2.1) Copyright (C) 1995-2002 Jorg SchillingTOC Type: 1 = CD-ROMscsidev: '0,0,0'scsibus: 0 target: 0 lun: 0Using libscg version 'schily-0.7'Driveropts: 'help'atapi: 0Device type    : Removable CD-ROMVersion        : 0Response Format: 1Vendor_info    : 'PLEXTOR 'Identifikation : 'DVDR   PX-708A  'Revision       : '1.06'Device seems to be: Generic mmc2 DVD-R/DVD-RW.cdrecord: This version of cdrecord does not include DVD-R/DVD-RW support code.cdrecord: If you need DVD-R/DVD-RW support, ask the Author for cdrecord-ProDVD.Driver options:burnfree        Prepare writer to use BURN-Free technologynoburnfree      Disable using BURN-Free technologyvarirec=val     Set VariRec Laserpower to -2, -1, 0, 1, 2                        Only works for audio and if speed is set to 4Now that I knew what options to use, I burned the .iso to the CD-R.

It's up to a decision maker to guide the policy that an administrator implements, and it's an analyst's responsibility to judge the likelihood that a given event respresents a security incident.

Both help administrators understand dependency issues when they might want to clean out unnecessary packages.Keep in mind that installing software via the FreeBSD ports tree results in the installation of a package, but not necessarily the creation of a package that can be moved among systems.  That is why administrators can install software with the ports tree and then use the FreeBSD pkg_info, pkg_delete, and other pkg tools to manipulated deployed applications.The first tool is This screen shot shows the \"Required Packages\" tab.  It shows all installed packages, not all of the packages which could be installed.  (This differs from a tool like The next screen shot shows the \"Dependent Packages\" tab.  This lists packages followed by their dependencies.  In this view, we're looking at \"pcre-4.5\" at the top.  Indented below it we see \"ethereal-0.10.3\" and \"nmap-3.50\".

Here is the menu command I use to start xterm:xterm -ls -sb -rv -fg green -fn 9x15bold -geometry 80x24The -sb creates a scroll bar; -rv specifies reverse video; -fg makes text green; -fn specifies the font; and -geometry sets the window size.I also want to make note of a file that I use to set a resolution of 100x100 when X starts.

Jones makes several good points, which I reproduce below.\r\r\"This is not the first time that Microsoft source code leaked onto the net. In 2000, the source code for MS-DOS 6 was leaked. It received considerable less attention, as most journalist considered it obsolete, despite the fact that it still had millions of users around the world, and that MS-DOS is actually the basis for many versions of Windows still in use today. That leaked source is still being passed around...\r\rIn October of 2000, Microsoft had to confirm that crackers had broken into their network and actually gained access to the Windows source code. That breach was done using the Qaz trojan. Microsoft has stated that this time round, their security has not been breached...\r\rEvidence inside the Windows 2000 source code leaked on Thursday 12 February 2004 suggests that this particular leak originated at long-time Microsoft partner MainSoft. The leaked source would implicate Eyal Alaluf, MainSoft's Director of Technology...\r\rMainSoft is a commercial company that provides a product called MainWin. The MainWin product makes it relatively easy for third-party software companies to make the programs they already created for Windows available on Unix as well.\rThe MainWin product is based on actual Windows source code...\r\rThe leaked source is more than three year old. The newest files in the Windows 2000 source code are dated 25 July 2000. The source probably corresponds to Windows 2000 Service Pack 1, while the current Service Pack for Windows 2000 is Service Pack 4. The Windows NT 4 source code probably corresponds to Windows NT 4 Service Pack 3, while the current Service Pack for Windows NT 4 is Service Pack 6a, and a Service Roll-up Pack has already followed it...\r\rHere\u2019s a table summarising the official figures [on Windows source code lines] collected from various Microsoft sources:\r\rYear: Product: Million Lines of Code\r1993: Windows NT 3.1: 6\r1996: Windows NT 4.0: 16.5\r1999: Windows 2000: 29\r2001: Windows XP: 45\r2003: Windows 2003: 50\r\rNone of these numbers means much. The issue is not what percentage got out, but what got out.  The real observation is that what got out is not just any part, but an important part of Windows, and you do not even need to read the leaked code to figure that out.  \r\rMainSoft's MainWin product allows developers to create Unix versions of their existing Windows programs. There are all kinds of technicalities, but the basic idea behind the MainWin product is very simple: MainWin pretends to be Windows.\r\rMainSoft has incorporated considerable parts of the Windows code into its MainWin product. In a very real sense, large parts of the MainWin product do not just pretend to be Windows, but are Windows.\r\rIn support of the MainWin product, Microsoft provided MainSoft with a license in its Windows Interface Source Environment (WISE) program. The WISE license provides source code access to the very core of Windows, the basis the rest of Windows is built on. The WISE program is so exclusive that it is not listed on Microsoft Shared Source Licensing Programs page. What is provided under the WISE license is so essential, that only a few companies ever got one. That fact alone already indicates the value Microsoft places on this particular source code license.\r\rThe source that leaked is part of what MainSoft got under that rather exclusive WISE license, and what it got is the hottest part of Windows.\"\r\rI found a January 1995 document archived on a site in China about \r\"The Windows Interface Source Environment (WISE) is a licensing program from Microsoft to enable customers to integrate Windows-based solutions with UNIX and Macintosh systems. Microsoft has licensed the Windows family source code to Mainsoft Corporation, Bristol Technology Inc., Insignia Solutions Inc., and Locus Computing Corporation. Using the products being developed by Mainsoft and Bristol, developers will be able to write to the Win32\u00ae API and OLE on different UNIX platforms...\r\rWISE SDKs enable developers to write to Windows APIs and use the resulting applications on Macintosh and various UNIX systems. To get a Windows-based application running on a Macintosh or UNIX system using a WISE SDK, the application source code must be recompiled on those systems...\r\rA WISE SDK consists of tools to port code from a PC and libraries to compile Windows code on the Macintosh or UNIX system.\"\r\rI also found a  announcing Mainsoft and Microsoft agreed to licensing terms for \"Windows NT 5.0\" source code.  According to this , \"Mainsoft is one of only two companies\u2014Bristol Technologies Inc. is the other\u2014with access to the source code under the Windows Interface Source Environment agreement.\"  I found this  claiming \"When IBM purchased Lotus Development Corp., it acquired Lotus's license to Microsoft's Windows Interface Source Environment (WISE), giving it access to the source code in Windows 95 and Windows NT, including Microsoft's OLE object technology.\"\r\rSo it seems Mainsoft may be in trouble for trying to get Windows programs to run on Unix.  If you want to run Unix programs on Windows, take a look at .  They work with the .\r\rUpdated:  Tamura Jones wrote me last week.

My user account uses bash, so I made the following entry in ~/.profile to ensure my prompt shows my username, system name, and present working directory when I log in.  The single straight quotes ensure that $PWD is substituted every time I change directories.  If I had used double straight quotes, then $PWD would be fixed at whatever my current directory was when the shell was started.  Single straight quotes helps us use \"dynamic substitution.\"  Using the back ticks sets the value of the system name.PS1='$USER@`hostname -s`:$PWD 'Here's the result:richard@orr:/home/richard$ Changing .profile affects prompts seen when logging in to the terminal and remotely via SSH.  This entry in ~/.profile doesn't influence the prompt seen by terminals started within X, as they are not \"interactive\" shells.  (I still haven't figured that one out.)  To ensure terminals in X share the same prompt, I made the same entry in the .bashrc file.For tcsh, the default shell for root on FreeBSD (csh and tcsh are the same binary), I made this entry in /root/.cshrc after the 'set mail' line:set prompt = \"%n@%m:%/# \"Tcsh doesn't support much dynamic substition, but a read of the tcsh man page showed several variables built into the shell provide what I need.  %n is the username.  %m is the hostname up to the first period.  %/ is the present working directory.

        "content": "I just finished reading an excellent article called  by Matthew D. Fuller.  He gets to the heart of the matter to describe how Linux and BSD are different.  Here's an ex cerpt on the idea of the BSD :\"The concept of the \"base system\" is something that, I think, causes the most trouble for people used to the Linux methodology. Which is perfectly understandable, because the whole idea just doesn't even exist in the Linux world.Linux, from the start, was just a kernel. Without getting into the eternal debate of what an \"operating system\" precisely consists of, it's easy to state that a kernel by itself isn't very useful. You need all the userland utilities to make it work. Linux has always been a conglomerate; a kernel from here, a ls from there, a ps from this other place, vim, perl, gzip, tar, and a bundle of others.Linux has never had any sort of separation between what is the \"base system\" and what is \"addon utilities\". The entire system is \"addon utilities\". MySQL is no different from ls from KDE from whois from dc from GnuCash from ... Every bit of the system is just one or another add-on package.By contrast, BSD has always had a centralized development model. There's always been an entity that's \"in charge\" of the system. BSD doesn't use GNU ls or GNU libc, it uses BSD's ls and BSD's libc, which are direct descendents of the ls and libc that where in the CSRG-distributed BSD releases. They've never been developed or packaged independently. You can't go \"download BSD libc\" somewhere, because in the BSD world, libc by itself is meaningless. ls by itself is meaningless. The kernel by itself is meaningless. The system as a whole is one piece, not a bunch of little pieces.\"He explains the :\"The difference between ports and RPM's isn't just that ports compile and RPM's just install. Ports are designed to cover the full range of bits and pieces of installing stuff; encoding and tracking and installing dependencies, packaging, installing and deinstalling, local changes necessary to build on your system, compile-time configuration tweaks... all those things. An RPM is just a binary package. If you want to auto-install dependencies, you have to have a higher-level tool like urpmi or apt-get to do it. And, since it's binary, you have to deal with library versioning conflicts, or missing compile options, or any of the other limitations you incur by not building it on your own system.And further, ports, like the rest of the BSD systems, are centralized... all those files in that big directory tree are maintained by the FreeBSD project itself. When somebody wrote KDE, for instance, it didn't magically appear in ports trees everywhere. Somebody had to write all the necessary \"glue\" to build a port for it, then commit the files into the FreeBSD CVS repository so it would be in the ports collection. So again, there's some level of assurance that it works with other things in the ports collection. Any dependencies it has will be there, because it can't declare a dependency on something not in ports.\"He also talks about :\"In a very real sense, BSD systems are constantly developed; I can always update my system to the absolute latest code, irrespective of \"releases\". In Linux, that doesn't really have as much meaning, because the release process is very different. I think the most appropriate verb for a Linux release is \"assembled\". A Linux release is assembled from version A.B of this program, plus version C.D of this program, plus version E.F of this program... all together with version X.Y.Z of the Linux kernel. In BSD, however, since the pieces are all developed together, the verb \"cut\" makes a lot more sense; a release is \"cut\" at a certain time.\"I highly recommend reading this article.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

        "content": "I just read a fascinating paper by Luca Deri, author of \"An explanation for the poor performance figures is something called interrupt livelock. Device drivers instrument network cards to generate an interrupt whenever the card needs attention (e.g. for informing the operating system that there is an incoming packet to handle). In case of high traffic rate, the operating system spends most of its time handling interrupts leaving little time for other tasks. A solution to this problem is something called device polling.\"FreeBSD has had device polling available in the kernel since , but you need to recompile the kernel and use a polling-aware NIC.  From /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/LINT on my 4.9 REL box:# DEVICE_POLLING adds support for mixed interrupt-polling handling# of network device drivers, which has significant benefits in terms# of robustness to overloads and responsivity, as well as permitting# accurate scheduling of the CPU time between kernel network processing# and other activities. The drawback is a moderate (up to 1/HZ seconds)# potential increase in response times.# It is strongly recommended to use HZ=1000 or 2000 with DEVICE_POLLING# to achieve smoother behaviour.# Additionally, you can enable/disable polling at runtime with the# sysctl variable kern.polling.enable (defaults off), and select# the CPU fraction reserved to userland with the sysctl variable# kern.polling.user_frac (default 50, range 0..100).## Only the \"dc\" \"fxp\" and \"sis\" devices support this mode of operation at# the time of this writing.options         DEVICE_POLLINGHowever, the  says other cards are supported, including the important SUPPORTED DEVICES     Polling requires explicit modifications to the device drivers.  As of     this writing, the dc(4), em(4), fxp(4), rl(4), and sis(4) devices are     supported, with other in the works.  The modifications are rather     straightforward, consisting in the extraction of the inner part of the     interrupt service routine and writing a callback function, *_poll(),     which is invoked to probe the device for events and process them.  See     the conditionally compiled sections of the devices mentioned above for     more details.According to Luca, the new Linux 2.6 kernel supports polling as well.  He re-ran his tests against Linux kernel 2.6 and FreeBSD 4.8 (polling enabled).  Linux with standard libpcap now captured 5.6% of traffic while FreeBSD captured 99.9%.  (That's my boy!)  When Linux implemented capture using a kernel module, Linux's performance matched FreeBSD at 99.5%.Not happy with this outcome, Luca modified the Linux  and wrote patches to create a ring-buffer based version of libpcap.  He found this works much better and plans to port it to FreeBSD as well.Update:  I asked the community to provide opinions on this paper.  You can read the thread at .Update:  On 20 Feb 04 Luca released a significantly modified version of the paper at the same URL.  The big issue for FreeBSD seems to be poor performance with higher packet sizes.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

Today I worked on installing open source software on each.  Starting with the Sun box running Solaris 8 on SPARC, I visited , an absolutely incredible site providing free compiled binary packages of key open source software.  Here's a sample installation:1.  FTP to the Sunfreeware site to retrieve the package for bash2.  Unzip the package with 'gzip -d'3.  Install the package with 'pkgadd -d'I later installed wget, which made step one much easier.  I was even able to install OpenSSH using the site's instructions, which outlined step-by-step the actions needed to install a necessary Solaris patch, then grab the required packages, create keys, and so forth.  I made my own startup script using ideas from the instructions:#!/bin/sh## Simple OpenSSH start script by Richard BejtlichSSHCONF=/usr/local/etc/openssh/sshd_configcase \"$1\" in start)  echo \"Starting sshd using $SSHCONF.\"  /usr/local/sbin/sshd -f $SSHCONF  echo \"Done.\" ;; stop)  echo \"Killing sshd.\"  kill `ps -elf | grep /usr/local/sbin/sshd | grep -v grep | awk '{print $4}'`  echo \"Done.\" ;; restart)  $0 stop  $0 start ;;esacFor my HP-UX needs, I visited another awesome site -- the .  They offered all the packages I needed, but before installing them I needed to get my HP-UX box to finish its boot process.  It was hanging while looking for an NFS server, so I followed the directions 1.  Enter single user mode by booting and hit 'ESC' to interrupt the boot process.2.  Enter 'boot pri isl'3.  Say 'y' to interact with ISL4.  At ISL prompt enter 'hpux -is boot'5.  In single user mode, mount the following filesystems: /usr and /var6.  Edit with 'vi' /etc/rc.config.d/nfsconf and say 'NFS_CLIENT=0'7.  'reboot'At the HP-UX site, I downloaded HP-UX's version of packages, called \"depots\".  For example:1.  FTP to the HP-UX site to retrieve the package.2.  Unzip the package with 'gzip -d' into /usr/local/depot.3.  Run 'swinstall -s /usr/local/depot/'swinstall when used through a Telnet session is a curses-like package installer.  Eventually I installed OpenSSH and used the model for Solaris to get it to work on HP-UX.  Thank goodness for these free repositories of open source software!  Would you believe there isn't a \"top\" command included with Solaris 8?  I was able to install it from Sunfreeware, though.I considered the day a success when I had GCC, wget, bash, and OpenSSH on both boxes, along with all of their dependencies.

The report doesn't explain why so many computers--both primary and backup systems--at FirstEnergy were failing at around the same time. But MSBlast is certainly a reasonable suspect. Unfortunately, the report doesn't directly address the MSBlast worm and its effects on FirstEnergy's computers. The closest I could find is this paragraph, on page 99: \"Although there were a number of worms and viruses impacting the Internet and Internet connected systems and networks in North America before and during the outage, the SWG's preliminary analysis provides no indication that worm/virus activity had a significant effect on the power generation and delivery systems. Further SWG analysis will test this finding.\"'Bruce's article makes valid points.  Until the panel explains why the electricity monitoring systems failed, MSBlaster will remain as likely a suspect as any.I found the report's goals interesting:\"Phase I: Investigate the outage to determine its causes and why it was not contained.Phase II: Develop recommendations to reduce the possibility of future outages and minimize the scope of any that occur.\"This sounds exactly like an incident response plan I use at client sites.

I took a close look at the competition and even started reading O'Reilly's Practical C Programming before realizing CPP4E was the book for me. I had no C programming background, but had the knowledge of C-64 BASIC, Pascal, and other languages shared by many kids born in the 1970s. If you're looking for a well-conceived introduction to C, Prata's book is for you.\"I plan to read books on secure coding and socket programming next, as these are my real interests.  I also have books on C++, Java, and C# waiting.  I'm reading these to gain familiarity with these languages for purposes of security, not contributing code to FreeBSD (yet). by Marcus Ranum:\"Let's set the record straight. This book is a 231 page political rant, regardless of the author's claim on p. 31 to be 'nonideological.' I have the slightly odd benefit of reading this book with a master's degree in public policy on the wall, but I work as a hands-on, FreeBSD-running computer security consultant. I imagine many readers are also members of the technical community, yet are unaware of books addressing similar topics. \"The Myth of Homeland Security\" cannot compare to a serious book like James Q. Wilson's Bureaucracy: What Government Agencies Do and Why They Do It. I'll tell you why and conclude with my rationale for 4 stars, nonetheless...So why do I give The Myth 4 stars? At least somebody is raising important issues. Ranum may be the crazy guy yelling crude remarks at a quiet moment during a political rally, but thank goodness he's there. It's great to see someone realize what a mess our appropriations process has become, and decide to join the fray. Political scientists spend their entire lives chipping away at the same problems. Welcome to the party, Mr. Ranum, and thanks for your work. \"Finally, from my four star review of  by Bruce Schneier:\"Beyond Fear is a good book, but don't turn to it for proper definitions of security terms. Steer clear of this book's misuse of the words 'threat' and 'risk.' While I appreciate Schneier's overall discussion of security issues, I expect a book aimed at the layman to be more accurate...I loved Secrets and Lies, and every time I see the author speak I learn something new. Am I off base with this review? You be the judge. I still gave it 4 stars, since the book's vignettes are informative and its scope impressive. Given the large number of reviewers I expected someone to challenge the author's terminology. Yes, this is semantics, but shouldn't a book by an expert set the record straight? I don't think my expectations are unrealistic, either; Schneier is a previously published 'thought leader,' and he deserves to be held to the highest possible standards.\"Reading the full text of each review, especially those on Ranum and Schneier, will make these points clearer.  As of the time of writing this report, Amazon.com has published an incorrectly edited version of the Schneier review missing the word \"a\" in the first sentence.  I expect that to be fixed soon.  I'm sure I'm opening myself up to criticism by publishing these reviews, especially for Schneier's book.  All the other reviews rave about it, so anything less than five stars will single me out.  Nevertheless, I believe it's important to take a close look at Schneier's work in the interest of improving whatever comes next.  Since so many people in the community pay attention to what he says, I want to make sure his message is clear.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I don't think these terms are difficult to understand.  I wrote the hopefully amusing vignette below to communicate my understanding of these terms.  At least it won't bore you! Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice...BATMAN:  Robin, why the puzzled look?ROBIN:  Sorry, Batman.B:  Are my Bat Ears crooked again?R:  No Batman.  I've been reading some books and vendor marketing literature on security, and I'm confused by their definitions of risk, vulnerability, and threat.B:  Oh, you've been researching to protect the Hall of Justice computer?  Good for you.  Tell me why you're confused.R:  I see so many people calling \"vulnerabilities\" and \"threats\" the same thing.B:  That's certainly not right.  A vulnerability is a weakness in an asset which could lead to exploitation.  A threat is a party with the capabilities and intentions to exploit a vulnerability in an asset.R:  Huh?B:  Let's try a few examples.  Consider Superman.R:  I do, often.B:  I don't want to hear about that.  Superman is an asset to the Hall of Justice, true?R:  He's definitely an asset.B:  I bet you think so.  Think of Superman as an asset of the Hall of Justice's crime fighting arsenal.  What is his weakness?R:  Kryptonite?B:  Close.  Superman's weakness -- his vulnerability -- is the fact that Kryptonite nullifies the effect of the Earth's yellow sun, removing his super powers.R:  So what is Kryptonite?B:  Kryptonite is a weapon, or tool.  But on its own it's nothing -- unless used by an evil party.R:  Like Lex Luthor?B:  Exactly.  Lex Luthor is a threat, but only if he's carrying Kryptonite.R:  Lex Luthor is the threat, because his intentions are to harm Superman and his capability is instantiated by possession of Kryptonite.  How does risk fit into this?B:  Let's define risk.  Risk is the possibility of suffering harm or loss.  It's a measure of danger.  The loss of Superman would deal a crushing blow to the Hall of Justice's ability to fight crime.R:  That means we're talking about the risk of loss of Superman's crime fighting abilities, or more generally the loss of Superman.  I don't know how to express that formally.B:  Let me help.  Risk is the product of multiplying measurements of threat by vulnerability by cost of replacing an asset, also called that asset's value. So, R = T x V x C.R:  You did say risk was a measurement of the probability of loss.  I don't know what the numbers should be for any of those factors.B:  It's ok to assign arbitrary values, say 1 to 5 for each factor, as long as you use the same scale when measuring different risks.  How would you assess the risk to the Hall of Justice now?R:  I would assign a Kryptonite-equipped Luthor as threat 4, with Superman's vulnerability as 4, and cost as 5, for a total of 80.B:  Why didn't you assign the threat and vulnerability to each be 5?  A Kryptonite-equipped Luthor has capabilities and intentions, and Superman's weakness can kill him.R:  I assessed the threat as 4 because I know Luthor has Kryptonite, but I don't know if he has enough to kill Superman.B:  That is prudent.  His capability to exploit Superman could be diminished.  You're factoring in uncertainty.  How about the vulnerability rating?R:  Superman isn't completely vulnerable, since we fellow Super Friends would protect him if Lex appeared.B:  So you mean we Super Friends could be considered countermeasures to Superman's vulnerability?R:  Yes!  Is that why the risk equation doesn't explicitly mention countermeasures?B:  You catch on quickly Robin.  Although countermeasures could be included in the risk equation, they complicate the issue mathematically.  Better to decrease the vulnerability rating if the countermeasure effectively mitigates the asset's weakness.R:  Batman, I'm starting to understand.  What is security then?B:  Security is the process of maintaining an acceptable level of perceived risk.R:  That seems awfully specific. B:  Let me explain with another example.  You know Fort Knox?  And the gold it protects?R:  Of course.  Gold is the asset protected by Fort Knox.  B:  Let's assess the risk of theft of Fort Knox's gold.  Risk is the probability of loss, remember?  Assume that Fort Knox is so well protected, it has no vulnerabilities capable of exploitation by any human, Super Friend, or Legion of Doom member.  Only a force of nature could damage Fort Knox, like a meteorite from space wiping out Kansas.R:  Holy invincibility, Batman!  Let me see...  I'd say the threat is low, maybe a 1, since there are evil parties with intentions to steal Fort Knox's gold.  Since Fort Knox is invulnerable to anything but a force of nature, no party has the capability to harm it.  I'd assess the vulnerability as 1, since Fort Knox could still be wiped out by that meteorite from space.  The cost of replacement is immense -- definitely 5.  That gives is 1 x 1 x 5 = 5.  That means...B:  That's right Robin.  The risk to the loss of Fort Knox's gold is 5, a very small number.  R:  So Fort Knox's gold is secure?  B:  It's almost perfectly secure, especially compared to Superman as a Hall of Justice asset.  Let's change the equation.  Do you know of the Marvel universe?R:  The what?B:  It's the source of better movies than our own DC universe.  Anyway, in the Marvel universe, a creature called the Hulk exists.  R:  Tell me about this beast.B:  For the purposes of this argument, believe that the Hulk could smash his way into Fort Knox if he so chose.R:  Is the Hulk evil?  Does he covet gold?B:  No, he's a powerful but misunderstood creature.  Do you know what you just did?R:  Let me guess -- I performed a threat analysis?B:  Excellent Robin.  Your shorts aren't too tight after all.  Now, on to the next step -- risk analysis.R:  Given the presence of the Hulk, I would assess the threat as a 4, the vulnerability as a 2, and the cost as a 5.B:  Why did you raise the threat level?  I told you the Hulk wouldn't harm Fort Knox.R:  Maybe the Legion of Doom could trick the Hulk into breaching Fort Knox?  Then the Hulk would have the capabilities and intentions to exploit the Fort.B:  Very good.R:  And I rated the vulnerability as a 2 and not higher, as even a creature like the Hulk would have a tough time powering his way through all that concrete and steel, surely?B:  True enough.  You're getting the hang of this, Robin.R:  Thanks Batman.  You're swell.  Can I try this sort of analysis using the Hall of Justice computer?  B:  You bet.  We run OpenBSD on the Hall of Justice machine.  Do you know if it has any vulnerabilities?R:  Well, I haven't updated OpenSSH yet, so there is a vulnerability.  That's a 5.  Let me do a threat analysis next.  I would identify the threat as the Legion of Doom.  Specifically, I bet Brainiac could code an tool that would exploit the vulnerable OpenSSH daemon.  B: That means the Legion of Doom has the capabilities and intentions to harm the Hall of Justice computer.  We call that a \"current credible threat.\"  R:  I'd rate the threat a 4, since we aren't 100% sure the Legion of Doom has an exploit.  They definitely capable of writing it though.  That leaves cost of replacement, which I would assess as a 5.  The Hall of Justice computer is a piece of critical infrastructure.  The risk of loss of the Hall of Justice Computer is 4 x 5 x 5 = 100.  That's immense!B:  Get to patching, Robin.R:  How can we reduce risk, Batman?B:  We can't reduce risk directly.  We can only affect each of the factors.  For the threat component, we could eliminate the party completely.  Alternatively, we could try change their intentions by addressing why they hate us.  We could also remove their capability to harm us, such as removing their financing or destroying their weapons.  R:  That sounds like a way to deal with terrorists.B:  Perhaps.  On the vulnerability side, you could patch the weakness directly.  You could implement access control or other counter-measures to limit the ability of intruders to exploit the vulnerability.  All of these factors decrease the vulnerability rating.R:  You're so smart Batman.B:  Thank you.  On the cost side, we could completely replicate the Hall of Justice computer and host it off-site.  While exploitation of the Hall of Justice computer would still be devastating, by implementing redundancy we could lessen the cost of replacing a damaged Hall of Justice computer.R:  Thanks Batman.  You've really helped me understand risk!B:  You're welcome Robin.  I hear the Bat Phone ringing -- to the Bat Poles!Note: Multiplying numbers together, without any measurement or rank, isn't exactly the \"science\" one would like to see in risk assessment.

        "content": "While reading the recently published second edition of , I noticed the legal material hadn't been updated.  I visited the  (EPIC) to get their take on legal restrictions on monitoring.  Their  page is extremely useful.  To actually read the PATRIOT ACT, I suggest going to a .gov source like the .  Search for \"public law 107-56\" (PATRIOT was passed by the \"107th Congress\") and you'll find the law (From the EPIC , I found these extracts applicable to network security monitoring.  First, EPIC discusses watching \"headers\":\"Section 216 of the Act significantly expanded law enforcement authority to use trap and trace and pen register devices. Prior law relating to the use of such devices was written to apply to the telephone industry, therefore the language of the statute referred only to the collection of \"numbers dialed\" on a \"telephone line\" and the \"originating number\" of a telephone call. The new legislation redefined a pen register as \"a device or process which records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted.\" A trap and trace device is now \"a device or process which captures the incoming electronic or other impulses which identify the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information reasonably likely to identify the source or a wire or electronic communication.\" By expanding the nature of the information that can be captured, the new law clearly expanded pen register capacities to the Internet, covering electronic mail, Web surfing, and all other forms of electronic communications. ...The USA PATRIOT does contain a provision requiring law enforcement to file under seal with the court a record of installations of pen register/trap and trace devices. This amendment may provide some measure of judicial oversight of the use of this enhanced surveillance authority.\"You may remember stories on wiretaps from 2002.  You can read the original evidence \"Prior law prohibited anyone from intentionally intercepting or disclosing the contents of any intercepted communications without complying with the requirements of the wiretap statute, unless such interception and disclosure fell within one of several statutory exceptions. The USA PATRIOT Act, Section 217, creates a new exception, permitting government interception of the \"communications of a computer trespasser\" if the owner or operator of a \"protected computer\" authorizes the interception. The new exception has broad implications, given that a \"protected computer\" includes any \"which is used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication\" (which, with the Internet, includes effectively any computer). The \"authorization\" assistance permits wiretapping of the intruder's communications without any judicial oversight, in contrast to most federal communication-intercept laws that require objective oversight from someone outside the investigative chain. The new law places the determination solely in the hands of law enforcement and the system owner or operator. In those likely instances in which the interception does not result in prosecution, the target of the interception will never have an opportunity to challenge the activity (through a suppression proceeding). Indeed, such targets would never even have notice of the fact that their communications were subject to warrantless interception. However, the USA PATRIOT Act does include an exception prohibiting surveillance of someone who is known by the owner of the protected computer \"to have an existing contractual relationship with the owner or operator of the protected computer for access to all or part of the protected computer.\"At this point you may want to know more about PATRIOT by reading applicable laws.  Remember that PATRIOT amended existing laws.  To see the amended laws, you need to know the title and sections affected.  For example, the EPIC article links directly to , e.g.,  or , aka \"The Wiretap Act.\"  Alternatively, visit the  of the House of Representatives and Another resouce is  of Slate's 4 part story on PATRIOT.  The  offers its views too.Remember that state laws restrict monitoring.  The  offers an excellent , with  and an article on .  Use the state guide as a pointer to specific laws in each state, since the RCFP's focus is recording voice conversations and not electronic monitoring.To validate the RCFP results I checked out the  and  contains .   is very similar to the Federal statute.  The section below seems to give the only cover to perform monitoring:\"It shall not be a criminal offense under this chapter for any person... (f) Who is a provider of electronic communication service to record the fact that a wire or electronic communication was initiated or completed in order to protect such provider, another provider furnishing service toward the completion of the wire or electronic communication, or a user of that service, from fraudulent, unlawful or abusive use of such service. \"Finding California's laws was a little more difficult.  I visited the state's , and after not getting useful hits on \"pen register\" I tried \"interception.\"  That yielded  of the .  Since this pertains to law enforcement actions, I used the information from the RCFP site to check .  Here I found that interception and recording is illegal, unless:\"(b) This section shall not apply (1) to any public utility engaged in the business of providing communications services and facilities, or to the officers, employees or agents thereof, where the acts otherwise prohibited herein are for the purpose of construction, maintenance, conduct or operation of the services and facilities ofthe public utility...\"Let's conclude this research with a check on Texas' laws.  The Texas  offers .  Looking at  we read:\"A person commits an offense if the person:(1) intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures another person to intercept or endeavor to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication...c) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under Subsection (b) that:(1) an operator of a switchboard or an officer, employee, or agent of a communication common carrier whose facilities are used in the transmission of a wire or electronic communication intercepts a communication or discloses or uses an intercepted communication in the normal course of employment while engaged in an activity that is a necessary incident to the rendition of service or to the protection of the rights or property of the carrier of the communication, unless the interception results from the communication common carrier's use of service observing or random monitoring for purposes other than mechanical or service quality control checks...\"Again we see language that mirrors the Federal statutes.  Note I have avoided citing statutes which offer consent as a defense for doing monitoring.  Consent can be obtained when intruders use \"bannerable\" services like telnet or FTP to access a victim.  If an intruder doesn't access an interactive service, there's no way to obtain the intruder's consent and thereby use consent exceptions to justify monitoring.For more information, read .

        "content": "This morning Marty Roesch, CTO and founder of , sponsored by IBM, to describe his company's  technology.  Here are my notes on Marty's talk, which he began by noting that \"Sourcefire is a security company,\" not just an IDS company.  What follows are Marty's main points, regardless of whether I agree or not.  Any personal commentary is specifically noted.CompanyAs a company, Sourcefire is firing on all cylinders.  After being founded in Mar 01, they shipped their first IDS appliance in Nov 01, their 100th in Aug 02, their 1000th in Jun 03, and will ship their 2000th shortly.  Projecting forward, they could be the #3 IDS vendor in terms of shipped units by year's end.  Marty's estimates 100,000 installations of the open source version of Snort.Sourcefire received about $7.65 million in funding in Feb 02, and another $11 million in Feb 03.  $8 million is cash in the bank.  They were cash flow positive in Q3 of 03 and will be profitable in late Q1 of 04.  During the last year, sales increased from $2.1 million to $23.2 million.In Feb 02 Sourcefire employed 4 people.  Within the last year they've grown from 22 to 90 employees, supporting 300 customers.Detection TheoryIDS is \"an automated system that monitors traffic on a network and based on defined rules/policies alerts administrators to possible intrusions, misuses, or defined malicious behavior.\"The \"fundamentall mission\" of IDS is data reduction, which is accomplished via stateful packet inspection and protocol anomaly detection.IDS provides awareness (how is my network/security architecture working, and are policies enforced?) and analysis (when intrusions occur, what happened and how can I prevent future trouble?)\"Classic IDS\" does not \"protect\" networks.  (Amen!)Other vendors hype \"sensing technology,\" when data management is the real issue.  Sourcefire has spent 5-6 man-years of research and development solving this issue.Most IDS' operate in a \"contextual vacuum,\" unaware of network architecture, assets, and their criticality. (My comment: without context, human analysts collect and analyze the data necessary to make decisions manually.)Network AwarenessActive vulnerability assessment tools are limited.  Their \"intermittent picture\" missies laptops, multi-OS systems, and assets reconfigured by intruders to be hidden.  Scanning for all active services takes too long, so not all protocols, ports, and services are found.  Active scanning disrupts availability and consumes bandwidth.Passive discovery sees everything active on the network.  It is \"persistent\" and \"real-time,\" \"all the time.\"  It transforms traditional IDS into a \"target-based IDS\" by eliminating \"nontextuals,\" or alerts without context.Passive discovery also performs vulnerability and protocol/port/service profiling, change detection, and policy compliance monitoring.  Using confidence models (percentages based on observed traffic, or decaying half-life models when nothing else is seen), one can answer questions like \"What hosts run SSH on ports other than 22 TCP?\" or \"What hosts run vulnerable SSH services?\"Taken further, upon seeing an attack, the IDS can report if it sees a new protocol/port/service in time X, perhaps indicating installation of a back door.An IDS supplemented by RNA technology is \"self-tuning.\"  Admins can assign priorities to their assets and tell an RNA-assisted Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) which actions to take against various threats.  Response range from simply alerting, to updating a policy on an access control device, to blocking packets or whole sessions.The Next GenerationNext generation technology offers control (via firewall and traffic filter integration) and monitoring (via threat detection and policy enforcement).The \"Sourcefire Insight System\" consists of (1) \"IDP\" (intrusion detection and prevention -- thanks Yen-Ming!) capable of IDS, threat monitoring, policy enforcement, and intrusion prevention; combined with (2) RNA, offering asset profiling, vulnerability assessment, behavioral analysis, network mapping, and policy enforcement, and (3) a console, doing correlation, policy optimization, and sensor management.  An \"inline\" IDP to provide its own access control (like IPS) is being researched.The Sourcefire console has two models, with the $18,000 box handling 40 million events and the ~$60,000 box handling 200 million events.  Both use a proprietary embedded database that could handle 30,000 events per second before keeling over during the MSBlaster attacks.RNA technology is designed to be lightweight so as to facilitate embedding it elsewhere.  Upcoming platforms will offer two network ports, and future boxes will have 6 six to seven.Following the prepared talks, Marty gave a live demo of a beta version of RNA watching traffic from Sourcefire to the Internet.  It could profile 40 unique services now. Visibility to hosts behind NAT and proxies is an issue, but research continues to address these issues.  The product's visualization features actually looked useful, unlike other more expensive products I've seen.  He showed nodes in , and hinted hyberbolic trees like those of  are forthcoming.Overall, I highly recommend you  to see Marty speak.  It's the clearest indication that  on \"Passive Vulnerability Detection,\" which explains many of the concepts put to operational use in RNA today.

        "content": "Congratulations to  of  magazine for speaking the truth about the intrusion detection vs. intrusion prevention debate in two articles.  First, from  (\"NIP\" meaning \"Network Intrusion Prevention\"):\"NIP is not a replacement for firewalls and won't be in the foreseeable future. Why? The fundamental problem is false positives -- the potential to block legitimate traffic. Before you can prevent attacks, you have to detect them, but NIP systems rely on intrusion detection, which is hardly an exact science. A properly configured firewall will allow in only the traffic you want, and you can bet the farm on that. We need to feel this same confidence in IDSs before we can believe in NIP systems, but IDS vendors have employed lots of talented brain cells trying to raise detection accuracy, and they're nowhere close to 100 percent.\" (emphasis added)Exactly!  How is a firewall doing intrusion detection any better than a non-firewall doing intrusion detection?Mike continues to raise the clue bar with these insights from :\"Network Associates doesn't let users see what constitutes a signature. When we asked about this, the company said it didn't want to help people develop evasion techniques. The Exploit Alert Detail dialog on the Alert Viewer reveals text matches for a given alert, but that one match could be a subset of all possible matches.Given time, we could have puzzled out most of the signatures via exhaustive searches, so we think Network Associates is just being difficult. In comparison, NetScreen opens signatures for review and editing--an approach we prefer.The lack of signature information quickly became frustrating, and it complicated troubleshooting when a match was based on a protocol anomaly because there wasn't enough information to know why a match occurred. We had to send packet traces to Network Associates to determine why an SNMP packet was being detected as a NetBIOS issue. It took a few days, but the company resolved the problem and provided an update to the signatures. Signature updates are automated, but you need to buy a support contract to get them.\" (emphasis added)This is exactly the problem with many commercial IDS tools.  If an analyst can't independently assess why the IDS generated an alert, she will not trust it and will disregard its warnings.  Unfortunately, NWC still gave the NAI product its recommendation.

Conventional approaches to monitoring and blocking rely on blocking TCP ports -- for example, Gnutella typically uses port number 6346 -- so a firewall would block Gnutella by shutting off access to port 6346. Unfortunately, this approach works only with unsophisticated users and applications; more sophisticated users and newer applications can easily switch to other ports and thereby bypass the firewall. PacketHound, on the other hand, uses the fundamental characteristics of the protocol itself in addition to relying on default port blocking and, as a result, is immensely more difficult to bypass.\"  I imagine this sort of inspection could be done with Another network product, this from  comes in forms for financial services and health care providers.

VIEW is designed to run on Vericept security appliances installed on a 10Base-T/100Base-T or Gigabit network.\"  If indeed some intelligent algorithms are in play here, and not simple string or regular expression matching, this could be helpful to detect all sorts of abuse.Copyright 2003-2020 Richard Bejtlich and TaoSecurity (taosecurity.blogspot.com and www.taosecurity.com)",

I was disappointed by IDWS, since I have a high opinion of Prentice Hall and the new \"Bruce Perens' Open Source Series.\" (I'm looking forward to the book on CIFS, for example.) IDWS read poorly and doesn't deliver as much useful content as the competing Syngress book \"Snort 2.0.\" I gave the much better  four stars.  This book will appeal more to programmers than to casual Snort users:\"Snort 2.0\" offers content not found in other books on Snort, such as Tim Crothers' more generic \"Implementing IDS\" (4 stars) and Rafeeq Rehman's \"Intrusion Detection with Snort.\" (3 stars) I've read the best IDS books, and used IDS technology, since 1998, and \"Snort 2.0\" is the first to give real insight into an IDS' inner workings.

They are proof that a little knowledge in the wrong hands really can do a lot of damage...a \u2018blind\u2019 penetration test will take considerably longer to discover the same number of security flaws. When conducting a full-knowledge (i.e. \u2018crystal-box\u2019) penetration test, it is a simple process to indicate within a report what information was necessary to make the security findings and what level of skill or knowledge an attacker would need to exploit any vulnerabilities.  Thus, a full-knowledge penetration test provides the same, or greater, level of security information for less time and cost. I would question anyone trying to sell a \u2018blind\u2019 penetration test for less than the cost of a full-knowledge penetration test.-- end quote --It sounds like Gunter doesn't understand the difference between a vulnerability assessment and a penetration test.  He uses the latter term but describes the former.  A vulnerability assessment involves discovering and documenting vulnerabilities, whether with \"blind\" or \"crystal box\" knowledge of the target.  A penetration test moves beyond discovery to actual compromise, where the analyst exploits targets to gain greater access to the victim network and implement a real-world intrusion scenario.

Roesch insists that IDSs and IPSs are separate technologies with mutually exclusive functions. \"IPS is access control, and IDS is network monitoring. IPS is policy enforcement, and IDS is audit. It's not the IDS's job to secure your network. Its job is to tell you how insecure it is.\" But Roesch's distinction may not resonate in the wider security market. \"Joe Average doesn't want to monitor traffic and comb through data and make changes in rules and policies based on detected attacks,\" says Jeff Wilson, executive director of Infonetics Research (www.infonetics.com). \"They want to stop attacks.\"-- end article --Fine -- prevention is always preferable to detection.

Host, a Web-hosting company with 90,000 customers, was hit with a crippling denial-of-service attack. By the end of the day, after outage complaints from what CEO Christopher Faulkner described as \"countless\" customers, the Fort Worth, Texas-based company got its lawyers involved. . . In an injunction filed in a Texas district court and later moved to a U.S. district court, C.I. Host alleged that the defendants committed or allowed a third party to commit a denial-of-service attack on C.I. Host's systems. The defendants insisted that they were victims of a hacker themselves, not the perpetrators of a crime.  The case never made it to trial, but C.I. Host's lawyers did convince a Texas judge to issue a temporary restraining order shutting down three of the Web servers involved in the attack until the companies could prove the vulnerabilities had been fixed. The other popular case is well-documented in the :The U.S. Navy's Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) is in the throes of an investigation into how and why an as yet unidentified hacker stole the source code to OS/Comet from a computer at the U.S. Navy's naval research lab in Washington, D.C. in an attack conducted on Christmas Eve, 2000. OS/Comet was developed by Exigent International (Melbourne,FL), a U.S. government contractor. The software has been deployed by the U.S. Air Force on the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) from its Colorado Springs Monitor Station, which is part of the U.S. Space Command. A copy of the OS/Comet source code was found during a police swoop in Sweden on a computer company whose identity has not been revealed. The intrusion appears to have emanated from a computer at the University of Kaiserslauten in Germany, which was used to download the software's source code via the Web and the service provider Freebox.com, which is owned by the Swedish firm Carbonide. The hacker known only as \"Leeif\" was able to hide his or her true identity by breaking into the account of a legitimate Freebox.com user and then using that person's account to distribute the source code to others. Exigent has filed suit against both Carbonide and the University of Kaiserlautern in Germany.
