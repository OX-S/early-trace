All the Christmas lights made the city sparkle.  It was cold -- but we were only there for a few days so we could take it!It was so nice to spend time as a family.  At times, things were a little confusing for me, but I still managed o.k.  I realize our \"family time\" is going to be more and more limited, both in terms of my health and the fact that my son is getting older and won't want to go with his parents on vacation.  But so far, he has managed to tag along and tolerate us having our family time.The best part of all is always the ice skating part.  I love to ice skate and my son laced up some skates and skated with me at Rockefeller Center.  It was just great.  I have always loved to skate and it doesn't matter how cold it is or what the conditions are, I just love to skate.  I guess growing up in Illinois helped with that as most Southerners don't seem to appreciate it as much as I do.We had very little bickering on this trip.  Not that we usually have a lot but there always seems to be those times when we argue over where we are going to eat, what we are going to do, how to get there, etc.  But, for some reason this trip was good in that regard.  It's strange that I think about that -- but I'm glad we didn't have that on this trip.It was a nice holiday present for me -- time with my family -- that's what I like most.",

I couldn't follow a lot of what was being said and I thought my head was going to explode after a couple of hours.  I'm glad I don't have to concentrate for long periods of time anymore!It's a couple of weeks before Christmas and here in the south it is still quite warm.  Our family is going to New York City next week just to \"play\" and it is suppose to be cold there -- I'm glad of that -- perhaps it will get us into the spirit of Christmas a little more.  And, I love to ice skate so I am looking forward to skating in Central Park and at Rockefeller Center.  It is so beautiful there with the Christmas tree and everything.

Their names are not Thelma and Louise but I started calling them that because they have such a zest for life and a little crazy -- I say that affectionately.  When I started calling me them that they didn't even know who Thelma and Louise were so they watched the movie and called me and said \"But we didn't kill anyone!\" -- which is true of course, but they still remind me of Thelma and Louise.Last night I went to a Kenny Rogers concert with Thelma and Louise in Atlanta.  It is my second concert with them.  Last night marked their 896th concert of Kenny Rogers -- yes, 896.  It is rather amazing -- and they love him more today than they did years ago when they started going to concerts.Thelma and Louise are sisters and this is their passion (obviously) -- but they are so happy when they are doing it -- I can't imagine being that happy over something you have seen 896 times!  But that is what makes life interesting -- those types of people and thank God for them.  I love these women -- they have become friends in a short time.  I wish I had their enthusiasm for life!",

I'm grateful he takes time for his family and always has.This hasn't been a real good week for me.  And, the bad thing is that when I have a bad time, it is very difficult for me to find the right words to tell somebody about it.  Usually my husband picks up on it and helps me along but he hasn't been doing that lately -- I think he is just missing the cues.  But, I can't tell him about it because I can't find the right words to express myself.  Never having had a problem with expressing myself before, this makes it even more difficult to deal with.  I guess it goes back to the \"aloneness\" of Alzheimer's -- you feel so alone because you can't communicate effectively.

We had hoped for about 300 people and we came close to that.  The Alz. Office is counting our money but we are hopeful that we reached our $20,000 goal.  The weather turned out great and the walk was awesome.I can't thank everyone enough for the hours they put into making this happen along with everyone who donated money.  Thanks to all of you reading this that made that happen!One thing that struck me is that strangers called me during the week after seeing the publicity in the paper and asked if they could come out and volunteer.  I know people volunteer all the time but to have people just call, without knowing anyone else or doing it with a group is amazing to me.  Maybe I don't give people enough credit -- because like I said, I know people volunteer all the time, but it usually a case where they are tied to the cause or have family or friends involved and they want to help.  But that wasn't the case with some of those that showed up to work today -- they just wanted to help.One of my friends had surgery on her foot and she came to the walk in a motorized wheelchair so she could \"walk\" with us.  The funny thing about it is, that she had the surgery two weeks ago and never told me.  We talk on the phone but we don't see each other very often.  She didn't tell me because she knew that I was working hard on the walk and she knew (or she thought anyway) that I would be over there helping her and worrying about her and not working on the  Memory Walk.  You can imagine how surprised I was when she showed up in a wheelchair.  That's friendship.  And, that's friendship you don't find real often.I am truly fortunate to have such wonderful people in my life.  My friends and family pitched in where ever they saw something that needed to be done and I cannot express my gratitude enough.When we find out how much money we raised I will let you know.

This group has dealt with Alzheimer's in a very personal way by caring for those with the disease.  I admire them so.

It is different than most of the \"walks\" in Athens, because most people just register the day of, pay their $10 or $15 to walk and it is over.  Since this is more of a fund raising issue, it doesn't work quite that way and it is just getting people to change their mind set.  It will turn out fine -- it is just change for many people.I have 15 or so people on my team this year and that is good.  I hope collectively we can raise $3,000. Last year we raised over $2,000.  However, many of the people on my team are forming their own teams this year since the walk is in Athens, so we may have to try a little harder.I go back to the neurologist next week.

I was trying to bat them down because I didn't want them to hit me -- I was totally unaware that I was out there to play a game -- I just couldn't figure out why my husband was hitting balls at me.Then I looked around at the other courts and saw the same thing happening on the courts and couldn't figure out why people would intentionally be hitting balls at each other because someone was going to get hurt!  After about ten or fifteen minutes I just broked down crying on the court because I couldn't understand why my husband would want to hurt me by hitting balls at me.  After a time out on the court for me to cry I regrouped, figured it out and when on to play.

I always worry about how he will see me the next time he comes home -- will he notice changes in me, will he be surprised with what he sees?  I guess I worry too much.  There's not much he can do about it anyway.I think I have somewhat of a routine going these days.

So, getting errands and such done in the morning and settling into \"home\" things in the afternoon seems to work for me right now.  Things come up that throw me off but I seem to be doing o.k. with everything for the moment.One thing I have noticed lately is that talking on the telephone is a little more difficult for me.  It's not the talking part, it is taking what the other person is saying, understanding what they are saying and putting the right words together for a response.  I am sure that sometimes the person on the other end thinks I'm not paying attention, but it takes me longer to put into words what I want to say.  I tend to lose the flow of the conversation if it is a long one and then I know my answers probably don't make much sense.  I ask a lot of questions on the phone,probably repeating myself several times in the process.  I remember before I was on my medication I asked those that I worked with that the preferred method of communication with me now was either putting a note in my box or email.

That whole \"working the mind\" stuff didn't go so well.  Since I was tired, I made a lot of stupid mistakes and stayed pretty much in my office and out of harm's way.  I feel like I hibernate most of the time, trying not to venture out of my office much just because it is too difficult to get back on track once I do.  So, I do better in my quiet office, all by myself.My office wants to have a retirement party for me and I have been fighting it.  I don't want a party but they are determined to have one whether I want one or not.  So, I have decided to give in and I figure that if I can be part of the planning that I can maybe steer it my way -- not too much fanfare.  I just want to go \"quietly into the night\", but that is obviously not going to happen if I don't have something to say about it.  I have a hard time around a lot of people and I will sometimes feel like a panic attack is coming on because of all the noise and trying to sort everything out.  I just get too confused and I am easily overwhelmed.  I know they know that and will take that into account when planning the party but I am still very uncomfortable about the whole thing.  I certainly don't feel like a deserve a party and just don't want a fuss.  However, I have specifically asked for no one to bring gifts and if people would like to make a donation to the Alzheimer's Association that would be great.......perhaps there is an upside to this!  I know they mean well and I appreciate the thought......I am just not very comfortable with it.  I guess I have about a month to get used to the idea and we'll see what happens.  I'm sure you will be reading more about this as we get closer and I get more anxious!",

On the website there are transcripts of testimonies that people gave that are very touching.  One in particular was from an \"email pen pal\" of mine, John, who spoke about his lovely wife who was diagnosed with AD and how he has been caring for her and his devotion to her.

They wouldn't let me play baseball with them so I would take my tennis racket and hit the ball against a wall while they played baseball.  I did this for hours -- or so it seemed.  Over the years I have played a lot of tennis.  And, admittedly so, I am a tennis snob.  Hate to lose, love to win, only want to play with good players, etc., etc., etc.  I know how selfish this sounds, but at least I can admit it.  I like to think that I am anEXtennis snob.  I hope so, but I guess you would have to ask someone else to be certain.  Today, I went out and played.  I haven't played in about 6 months.I was shocked at how bad my concentration level is now.  I know I have mentioned the stuff about how noise bothers me and makes it hard to concentrate.  When I was playing tennis there were people on other courts talking, some children out playing behind the courts and a family pulling a wagon over a wooden bridge.  I couldn't concentrate on hitting the ball.  My brain could not put into place the steps you need to actually hit the ball.  I just had to stop until the noise quieted a little.  I didn't ACT devastated but deep down inside I was.  Another of the things I am passioniate about in my life has become an obstacle.  Of course, I'm not going to quit playing tennis.  I just have to pick quieter times to play.On a brighter note, my son called from college this week and told us he had won an award at Georgia Tech which is the highest academic honor you can win.  All of those nominated have 4.0 grade averages and then all of the other things they do plays a part in the award.  I'm so proud of him.

Work has been extremely hard this week and at one point, I was so confused I wanted to call my husband and ask him to come and get me so I could go home and snuggle up in a warm bed and take a nap.  Nothing was making sense and I didn't know what to do about it.  My brain had turned to jello and it was melting!  Somehow, I regrouped and made it through the day but it was tough.  I've mentioned before that routine is very important to me and I have bad days when my routine is out of kilter.  Having this cast on my foot has definitely changed my routine and perhaps that is contributing to my difficult times of late.I had a confrontation on the phone with our cell phone provider and I was so confused by what she was saying that I know that I was not getting across to her.  I knew exactly what I needed to say but the words could not come out and I got very frustrated.  The whole situation was frustrating but I felt taken advantage of.  Another instance where I felt this way was when I went into a drugstore to buy a lot of things and I had a bunch of coupons.  When I was being checked out I knew that the clerk had not rung it up properly to take into account my coupons and the sales items, but I couldn't explain it to her.  It was all in my head, but I couldn't get it out properly.  I felt like a senior citizen being scammed by a con artist. There was absolutely nothing I could do to make the situation right because I didn't have the capability of communicating the right way.  That is also a good reason not to go shopping by myself -- which I don't do very often.But, I was able to enjoy a weekend with my son home and celebrated my husband's 60th birthday yesterday.

One of the family members, Julie Noonan Lawson has been communicating with me on and off for the past year or so via email.  It was nice to put a face to her email address.  How brave her family is and how I admire her.  Since the program was taped Julie has lost her sister Fran (who has highlighted in the show) to AD and another brother has been diagnosed.  There are 10 children in her family and Fran was the 4th member of her family to die of Alzheimer's.  I cannot imagine what her family has and is going through.

I can't do math in my head any longer and I can't do three things at once any longer. So I was doomed from the beginning of the morning.

I prefer to walk in New York instead of taking cabs.  I was very frustrated when I found that even though the streets are numbered I had a hard time getting around.  One day I had four appointments.  I was staying at 6th and 53rd.  My first meeting of the morning was at 6th and 45th Street.  My second appointment of the day was 7th and 46th Street.  Pretty easy to get from one place to the next, right?  Well, not for me.

But, I got around to where I needed to go and on time......so I shouldn't be complaining.  I figured out how to do it.......eventually.  Dealing with Alzheimer's is just dealing with your life a different way.  When you can't do something you figure out how to do it differently.  That's hard to do and I don't know how long I'll be able to do that -- think of the alternative way to do things-- but hopefully it will be awhile before that happens.The noise was pretty overwhelming in New York, but I knew that was going to be a problem.  Everything is noisy in New York.........cabs honking, sirens wailing, people talking loud.  I was prepared for that though.  I just wasn't prepared for some of the other things that happened and, I'm too tired to go into those things!I'm exhausted from the trip. It took a lot more out of me than it should have.  I've been back for two days and I'm still exhausted.  Tackling emails, mail, meetings and phone calls when I got back was awful.  It is hard for me to compartmentalize things so when I got back to work and saw the mass of paper that had accumulated on my desk while I was gone I was overwhelmed.  I still haven't been able to put it into piles of what to do or what to throw away.  It's too much.  I haven't figured out an alternative way to do that yet.......but I'm trying.",

I know the city quite well and feel comfortable in getting around the city.  But the noise confuses me.  Being in crowded restaurants, city noises, cabs honking, sirens blaring, all can get me pretty confused.It's strange how noise affects how I think but in talking with others with Early On Set Alzheimer's this is something we all deal with.  The only way I can describe it is that the noise turns into \"white noise\" in my brain and I can't filter things out.  That gets me confused.

For a long time I have noticed friends wearing a special necklace that someone close to them gave them and they never take it off -- kind of like a wedding ring.

I've mentioned before that noise is a real problem for me.  Well, I thought I could handle it -- but I couldn't.  I've been doing well with the women's basketball games I regularly attend but they are definitely not as loud as the men's games.  It was hard for me to keep focused despite the closeness of the game and after the game I was mentally exhausted.  It was a quiet night in our house last night because I couldn't carry on a conversation, or follow anything on television -- it just wasn't in the cards.  I guess I'll settle for watching men's basketball on television!I'm going to New York in a few days on business.  I am quite familiar with the city so the trip itself does not bother me -- although I know that I have to write everything down and be sure that I have proper identification on me in case something were to happen.  But, the business end of the trip does bother me somewhat.  First of all, it is very difficult for me to get ready to go.  I'm not as organized as I once was -- and that probably isnt' even a fair statement.  I actually know what I have to do to get ready, but I find that it is more difficult for me to pull things together.  It is like when I am having a \"bad brain day\" (as I am fond of calling my bad days) and having to prepare dinner.  I know what I want to cook but I can't get it all to come together --when to time out things so they will all be done at the same time.  I know what needs to be done but I can't get there without assistance.  It's rather frustrating.  But I have started to get ready for the New York trip but it is just taking a lot longer than I had planned.  I used to be able to spend a couple of days putting my work stuff together and one evening packing.  I've been working on this process for over two weeks -- perhaps by Wednesday I will have it all put together!",

I didn't realize what so much concentrating to get through a day of work was \"costing\" me.  I haven't had to really think and stay focused for long periods of time during my time off and it has been like a burden off my shoulders.  I did work some from home and during that brief time period during the day I would be o.k., but I do realize what a heavy weight it is on me.  I went to lunch with my family and some friends today and the noise in the restaurant was quite a bit for me to handle. One of my biggest challenges is sorting the noise in my brain.  It is extremely hard for me to concentrate and carry on a conversation with lots going on around me. Thankfully, my friends and family know this -- and bless their hearts they still want to be with me!  Gone are the days when Kris' monopolizes the conversation (that's probably a good thing for them).Having my son home from college while I have been home has been great.  I really appreciate the times we have together.  Although it takes some getting used to having him being back at home.  It is harder for me when he is home because of all the extra noise that is generated.  I have a difficult time while watching television or listening to the radio when people are talking.  I tend to leave the room and find some some quieter place.  I forget when he is not here that my husband knows that we can't converse while doing something else -- so we don't.  Or we turn the \"noise\" off.  Simple things like this are easy to forget -- but it's just an obstacle we deal with.  It's not life threatening and knowing what you need to do when it gets a little distracting helps.  My family doesn't take offense to it -- they have learned to live it.  I love them for that. Alan returns to school tomorrow -- that makes me sad.By the way -- don't ever give anyone you love with Alzheimer's a jigsaw puzzle for Christmas.",

It has been nice having Alan home -- since he has been studying for final exams we haven't been doing a lot. He has been very very good and staying in his room and studying.  It's very hard for me to not go into his room when he is studying and I have probably interrupted him more times than I should have!But, because he has been so \"quiet\" I have found this holiday to not be too bad.

The amazing thing is that they cost $20,000 in American money -- and we don't think that includes the land!The third phot is the Archbishop of Canterbury talking with Father Christmas.

Pody is teaching in Canterbury this semester and what a lovely city.  It reminded me of going to a Renaissance Festival.  It was so beautiful.  The Canterbury Cathedral is just a five minute walk from Pody's apartment and it is so amazing.Pody got us tickets to a Christmas Carol concert at the Cathedral one night and it was a candlelight service with their boy's choir singing.  You can just imagine how that was.  And on Saturday morning, there was a Christmas parade and Father Christmas met the Archbishop of Canterbury at the end of the processional.  Then there were carols and a small ceremony.  Father Christmas garnered much more attention than the Archbishop.  The amazing thing that Pody and I both noticed was that if this had been done in America there would have been security all over the place with barricades and crowd control.  But not the case in Canterbury.  The parade was not what we think of as a parade here -- it is hard to describe but soon I will post some photos on the blog.  But the meeting of the Archbishop is a big deal and there was no one \"protecting\" him or security.  And, Pody and I actually got to speak with him....which was even more amazing.  Pody had greetings for him from the University of Illinois where the Archbiship had a god daughter that attended there.  Someone casually said to Pody before she left Illinois, if you ever see the Archbishop send him our regards.  Well, who ever thought that would happen but it did!I guess the funny thing to me was that when I was in England over 30 years ago, I stayed with some friends in Manchester.  They had a dinner to go to in London and they took me along and at the dinner was the Archbishop of Canterbury.  I had no idea who he even was (I was only 18 and pretty ignorant about all that stuff) and I got to meet him and talk with him.  I wasn't real impressed at the time because I really didn't know anything about the Church and all of that stuff!  It is a different Archbishop now, but to think that my path crossed with the Archbishop's twice is something I would have never thought would happen.Pody has been sick with a cold and I felt bad as she and her husband played host since she was sick, she should have been getting some rest.I did o.k. -- got tired but we did a lot and that was to be expected.

I decided I was having a good enough day that I could speak from just my notes and it turned out pretty well.  I'm never quite sure going into it whether I'm going to hit a chord with the group I'm speaking to or not.  But, as I have said before, this is much for therapy for me as it is hopefully an education for them.  They were extremely gracious women and made me feel very comfortable -- I'm sure it is that Southern Charm.  But, I appreciate them taking the time to listen to my message and hopefully I was able to answer a few questions for them.  I enjoyed myself but I was extremely tired when I returned home and a nap was in store.  I have spoken to a group in about a month and it took more out of me than I thought it would -- but it was worth it -- it is always worth it!

Not bad, but it seemed like I was about a second or two off from what I should have been.  I never thought too much about it at the time.Then when my husband came home we went out to play tennis.  And, I noticed my reaction time on the court was really off.  Now sometimes I just don't go race down a shot out of sheer laziness but tonight, my brain didn't even tell my body to run for the ball until after it had bounced -- and then it was way too late.

After about an hour and a half we were in the shade so we survived and the Braves won.Last weekend Alan his dad and Jennifer painted his room.  Then we had new carpet put down.  The house was a mess for several days and it really took its toll on me.  Things were not in the right spot and I got really confused. Alan's stuff was all over the house and it was so confusing to me that I had a few pretty rocky days until it was finished.  Now the house is somewhat back to normal and I am feeling better.

I found it extemely difficult to work in the kitchen -- I had to ask for help several times.  I was just so confused because I didn't know where things were and where to put them back when I got them out, etc. etc.  Also, Hilton Head was a lot busier in general than we had remembered it. There were  a lot more people and a couple of times, I found myself very close to a panic attack because there were so many people around and I was in a strange place.Sometimes when we go on vacation I like to venture out on my own.

Nimrod MacNair (Mac) and Dr. Neil Shulman (best known for being Doc Hollywood, being portrayed by Michael J. Fox in the movie -- he is also an author). Neil's mother passed away a few months ago with Alzheimer's and Mac's wife suffers from the disease.  In many discussions over the last few months with these gentlemen and the director of the Alzheimer's Association, we realized it is important to talk about the disease in \"not so frightening\" terms -- as Neil uses humor as a technique in teaching medicine as well as his writings.  So, we had some fun and taped about an hour's worth of material.  The Alzheimer's Assn. is hopefully going to be able to edit in some form that it will be useful to those suffering from the disease as well as those that are caring for their loved ones.Mac is also organizing a fund raiser for Alzheimer's in the community he is currently living in.  Heather Whitestone (Miss America 1995 (I think) who is hearing impaired) is going to be the featured speaker.  She talks about overcoming diversity in her speeches.

        "content": "This is going to be a long post so if you don't have a few minutes I would come back to this!Yesterday, my son took me to a conference on Alzheimer's Education. The speaker was Joanne Koenig Coste and you have probably heard me speak about her book Learning To Speak Alzheimers.  She was a terrific speaker and had some great points about Alzheimer's.  If you are dealing with Alzheimers please go out and buy this book -- it is worth every penny.  When I speak I usually take this book with me and end up giving it to someone at my talks -- it brings this disease down to a patient's perspective and I obviously can't say enough about it.Yesterday, I also recieved word from the Social Security office telling me that I wasn't disabled. Tell that to my brain!  They basically said that I need to get myself back to work -- which I guess we will appeal in time.  How can it be that three doctors have said I can't work and I take a test from a grad student at UGA and it is deemed that I can work.  That's our government at its best.I haven't written about this experience or really mentioned it to many people but my son thought I should write about it since this journal is really for that purpose.  It has often been said that Alzheimer's is a lonely disease -- and it is kind of hard to explain that.  And, I have said that you certainly know who your friends are as many drop you like a hot potato when they find out that you have Alzheimer's.  The phone stops ringing and many write you off.  When people find out about it they literally stop talking to you as if you are stupid and can't understand what they are saying.  They don't realize that you still have feelings. I say this only to preface an incident that occured a couple of weeks ago.  I attended a luncheon that was honoring a friend of mine.   I didn't know any of the women sitting at my table, but I did know several others that were at the luncheon.  They came up and spoke to me and we chatted for awhile.  Those at the table were good at making small talk since none of us really knew each other.  Then, a person seated nearby made a comment that she knew who I was -- I was that lady that had to stop working because of Alzheimer's.  I replied that \"yes, I was\".  At that moment, everyone at the table and near me stopped talking to me -- it was as if I disappeared in a puff of smoke.  It made me so mad.  Luckily the program started shortly after that and it diverted my attention......if someone said I had cancer or heart disease, I doubt they would have stopped talking to me -- it's a shame really.  Now you can understand why my real friends are important to me -- you know who you are and thank you for standing by me!On a lighter note, I haven't really mentioned much about my trip to Illinois to see my brothers and friends.  It was a great trip -- I realize how I can't really travel by myself anymore though so it was great to have Alan along with me.  We always laugh alot when we are together and that is so refreshing.  My world is a lot smaller now and having those around me that can laugh with me is a joy.  I got to catch up with an old friend of mine that used to be a client.  We don't see each other often enough, but he is a great guy and has been a friend for 30 years.  Lunch once a year doesn't seem like enough but we do stay in contact with each other and it is so nice that he still cares about me and I care so much about him.  We have been great friends over the years. Thanks Dave!My friends Pody and Rick and their daughter Rachel have been friends for just about as long.  We always have a great time together -- Pody actually cooked a meal for us and for Pody that is saying a lot -- her claim to fame is that she can't make jello so her cooking always brings us a chuckle!  But the lunch was great and I think after all these years she has finally learned to cook -- just kidding Pody.  Their daughter Rachel is an attorney in downtown Chicago and she and Alan had a lot to talk about.  We enjoy their company -- I wish we lived closer but they have been great to keep in touch with us.My family is growing with great neices and nephews.  It's fun to be around the little ones and see their moms with the children.  Thankfully, the weather was nice for a great big family picnic and the children got to play outside.  I'm not sure with all the noise they make that I could have taken having them all in the house with us -- but they seem to be doing well and I wish I could see them more often --they grow up fast.I've probably written enough for this post.

I've been rejected a couple of times, which, we've been told is pretty normal for the Social Security office.  But, they decided to send me for some neuro-psychological tests this past Monday I guess to assess \"my disability\".  I've had these tests before and they are difficult but I had to go......so I went.The tests were suppose to last three hours.  They began at 10:00 a.m. and didn't end until five hours later!  We had no lunch break and I had one rest room break.  They kept asking me if I wanted a rest room break but I settled for one during the five hours.Now, think about it, it is very difficult for anyone to sit and take tests for five hours, let alone someone that has Alzheimer's.  The last time I took these tests (for my original diagnosis) it was done over two sessions both lasting about two hours.The tests I had done Monday were done at the UGA Psychology clinic and were administered by a grad student.  (My nephew is studying for his doctorate in psychology so I kept envisioning him sitting across the table from me.)  The sessions were videotaped and we were also in a room that had a two way mirror for observation.  I felt like I was in a police precinct (although I have never been in one, it looks like those interrogation rooms from television).The tests started off with me telling them a little about my condition and the things I could not do.  Then of course, most of the tests were \"things I can no longer do\" -- like math for example.  I just can't do that sort of thing -- in my head or on paper.  It was all being timed  so I didn't get many answers right.  After doing a bunch of memory tests and sequencing tests they then moved on to vocabulary and general knowledge questions.  I must admit that after about two and a half hours I probably couldn't have told you my name at that point, let alone who Cleopatra was or who the President of the United States was during the Civil War.  Many times when I confessed to not knowing I was prompted for a guess.  I'm sure they thought I was being a smart a** but I wasn't.....I was tired and cranky and just couldn't go on.I'm not stupid......but how do they know I'm not stupid?  These tests are designed to try to find me employment.....I can see them coming back and saying she can work....\"she's just stupid\". Alzheimer's certainly makes you feel stupid and many of us fight that all the time.  We have to keep reminding ourselves that it isn't us --- it's the Alzheimer's. When you're tired it is hard to distinguish the two.I was so exhausted when I got home (and I'm lucky I could get home on my own), that I fell asleep in the chair, couldn't carry on a conversation with my husband, went to bed at 7:30 and slept until 6 the next morning.  The next day I was still dragging and not thinking real clearly.I was talking with someone at the Alzheimer's Association in Atlanta yesterday and relaying this information to them.

I never thought I would ever be married 25 years -- it just seems like a long time -- and it is I guess -- it certainly hasn't seemed that long. My husband and I enjoyed a nice quiet dinner last night.  Our son sent us a card and a nice letter.  In it he said he didn't think he had ever written us a letter -- which is not true as he went away a few times and actually wrote us a letter but I don't think he remembers.  With the age of email and instant communication I feel like letter writing is a lost art. But don't we all love to get \"real mail\" and a letter from our son was a beautiful gift.  It was filled with lots of reflection on his part and he raised some interesting points -- some which need to be addressed before too long and some that he will never understand until he is a parent himelf.  I used to hate it when my mom would say this to me \"You'll understand when you have kids of your own\" -- but it is oh so true.Lots of wonderful things have come out of our marriage but our son is the most wonderful thing. I'm sure that all parents feel that way.My husband --a man of few words -- also sent me a \"letter\" of sorts --this time electing to use the electronic version of email.  He said some things I would have never expected him to say but they were nice words to read.

I am not sure I have been as good -- but we are still together.I hate the fact that \"Big Al\" (Alzheimer's) will be taking more of my time as we continue our journey through life. My husband didn't marry that and for that I am truly sorry.",

It's not a great excuse but one just the same.My nephew visited us for three days.  He had two conferences in Atlanta -- on consecutive weekends so he came to visit us for a few days in between.  While he was here I had  a talk to give in Dahlonega and he went with me.  It was nice to spend some time with him.  He is 25 years old and we moved here 25 years ago so I never really had a chance to get to know him. He's a bright kid and studying for his PhD in School Pyschology.  But we had a great time going to Dahlonega and the folks there were so gracious.  When I speak about my Alzheimer's it is really more therapy for me I think than the groups I speak to so I'm always grateful to get the opportunity.Then we took my nephew to meet up with my son in Atlanta and he spent a night with him before his next conference started.  This weekend my nephew will fly back to Illinois late on Sunday and my brother is coming into Atlanta on business on Sunday morning.  Our plan right now is to meet my brother, get my son, catch up with my nephew and all have a meal before my nephew gets on a plane.  It's hard for me to follow -- so I am hoping that someone else is keeping track of all of this!As I write this my son is at the University of Chicago Law School for their admitted students weekend.  He went to Harvard's and last weekend he went to Stanford's.  It is down to these three and I feel that a decision will be soon.  I know this is a difficult decision for him and I'm trying to keep out of it -- it needs to be his decision.  That's hard for me to do!Next week is our 25th wedding anniversary.  That is a milestone.  I never thought I would ever be married to anyone that long!I have another speaking engagement in Albany next week and after that I think I need to rest.  Not being on my routine is difficult and I'll be glad when I can get back to it.  I just have too many bad days when I am not on my routine.",

Over the next couple of weeks I have out of town company  coming and several speaking engagements out of town.  I hope by April 15th I will be able to be back on more of a regular schedule and calm down some.  I get really anxious when things don't follow a routine.  I know I need to be better about controlling and that is something I am going to really have to work on this summer when my son is home.It is hard for me to just do something on the \"spur of the moment\" like I used to.  I feel uneasy and unsettled and pretty confused.  I know my son will understand when he decides at the last minute he wants to go play tennis or do something that I can't always do it.

Not exactly sure what that means, but I know he had some concerns before leaving so maybe those concerns have been cleared up.  The first of April he heads to Stanford and then he is off to Chicago.  We will all be glad when this law school decision is over.  It is very hard!I have several Alzheimer's speeches to give in the next month -- one in Dahlonega, one in Albany and I will be returning to Washington DC for the Public Policy conference.  All of these are so important -- it does me good to do them, but it is also exhausting and makes me realize all the challenges ahead.  I'm usually pretty good at blocking them out (I think that is the survival instinct) but when I do the talks it hits home even more.  It is harder for me to travel by myself and I know that limits what I can do for the cause.

He has it narrowed down to four Stanford, Harvard, Yale and the University of Chicago.

We have a big goal set for us this year but I know that we can make it.But, these people are phenomenal.  They give and they give and they give.

But, yesterday -- I had a bad day and what that really means is:1. I have an electric toothbrush and when I was brushing my teeth yesterday I couldn't remember how to turn the toothbrush off!  It sounds funny now, but I just didn't have a clue.  I ended up putting it in the kitchen sink because I was afraid if I put it on the counter that the vibration would knock it on the floor.  So, I put it in the kitchen sink.  I also couldn't remember where I was suppose to spit out the toothpaste -- so I went to the trash can and spit it out there.  Later, I saw the toothbrush in the sink and thought \"why is the toothbrush in the sink and it is turned on?\"  I picked it up and turned it off, cleaned it off and put it away.2. I then had a dentist appointment.  The day before I had broken my glasses and made an eye doctor's appointment to be sure my prescription was still the same before ordering new glasses.  But the whole time I was at the denists getting my teeth cleaned I thought I was at the eye doctor's.  I couldn't figure out why this lady was messing around with my mouth, when they should be looking at my eyes.  It was obviously very confusing.3. On the way home from the dentist there was an accident and all the traffic was stopped for a long time.  I couldn't maneuver my way around it and couldn't make a u-turn because of the other traffic.  So, I just sat with my engine idling.  I noticed that a lot of people were turning off their engines to wait it out.  I thought I would do the same, however, I thought to myself that if I turned the engine off, I wasn't sure I could remember how to turn the engine back on and then what would I do?  I didn't want to call anyone and ask them because I just couldn't bring myself to do it, so I just sat with my car idling until the wreck was cleared up and then I was on my way home.All these things happened in one morning...and that is a bad day.",

On a lighter note for him, he went to Mardi Gras in New Orleans over the weekend.  I guess I need to clarify what \"going to Mardi Gras\" really meant in his case.  One of his roommates works for Delta so they got some cheap air fare to New Orleans.  They left on Sunday morning around 9 a.m., stayed up all night and then got on a plane early Monday morning to come back to Atlanta.  So, they weren't there for even 24 hours but I guess they got to \"experience Mardi Gras\" if that is what you call it!  I guess it would be nice to be young again and do that.  It would take me about a month to get over a trip like that!On February 14th my son has an audition in Atlanta for the game show Jeopardy.  It is something he has always wanted to do -- why not go for it I guess.  He's a lot braver than I would be.  He thinks that if he can get on the show it will help pay for law school.

There are some in Atlanta so I asked my son if he would go ice skating with me when he came home for Christmas break.  So, we went this morning.  My husband, my son and I went to meet Alan's girlfriend and her family who were going to skate with us as well.About 20 minutes into the ice skating session my husband fell on the ice.  He said he hurt his elbow and we got off the ice to see if he could bend it, if it was bleeding, etc.  It seemed as if he might have bruised it a good bit.  After a few minutes he said he wanted to go to the hospital and have it checked out.  Mind you, my husband doesn't go to the doctor very freely -- so I figured it must have been hurting more than he let on -- he has a relative high threshold for pain.  So, we drove back to Athens (about 45 minutes) to go to our local hospital.  After xrays, it was determined that he broke his elbow.  Surgery now awaits him next week.Many of you reading this may know that many years ago he fell off of a ladder and broke his elbow on his left arm and his wrist on his right arm, both requiring surgery.  After casts were applied, there were no hands available to do the minor things in life and it was a little difficult for awhile.  This time he broke his right elbow and although he is right handed, at least he has a hand free this time -- and that will make life a little easier.You always have to find that bright spot!",

I had to deal with agents, promoters, tour managers, tour accountants, groupies, roadies and of course the talent itself.  Sometimes working with these people was fun, sometimes it was a nightmare!  But sometimes the most interesting people I dealt with were the fans themselves.  I really came to understand the word \"fan\" as being \"fanatical\".  There were all kinds -- good, bad, weird, obsessive, good natured and fun.  I could go on and on about the fans I have met over the years.   When Bob Dylan came to play at our venue the fans were extremely strange.  We had lots of gifts, flowers, letters, etc. that were sent to the venue to give to Mr. Dylan.  The rock groups had their groupies.  We had to do a lot of homework when an act booked with us to see what the fans were like and what we had to expect during the days and nights leading up to the show.Which brings me to \"Thelma and Louise\".  Back in 1997 we booked Kenny Rogers for one of his Christmas Shows.  I received a phone call from two ladies that live in Stone Mountain Georgia.  They told me what big Kenny Rogers fans they were and wanted to come over to the look at the theatre so they could \"pick out their seats\".  Our venue was relatively new at that point so many people were not familiar with the layout of the theatre.  My first thought at the time when I was talking to them was, \"I just don't have time to show two women the theatre so they can \"pick out their seats\".  Besides many of our seats were pre-sold to season ticket holders and these women didn't have a chance of being able to \"pick out their seats\", because the ones that they wanted would probably already have been sold.  But after talking to them for awhile, I relented and told them to come over.  They lived a little over an hour away and we made an appointment for them to come visit me.When they arrived, they turned out to be more than a typical fan -- these ladies in their late 40's early 50's were true fanatics.  They are sisters and they told me that they had been to over 500 of Kenny Rogers' concerts.  They were also going to be buying close to 100 tickets (or more) because they had so many people from Stone Mountain that wanted to come with them that they needed to accommodate them.  They were renting buses and making this a grand affair.  They also wanted to feed these people in one of the banquet rooms adjacent to the theatre. At the time, Kenny Rogers had a chicken franchise called Kenny Rogers Roasters.  There was one in Athens and the women wanted them to cater this dinner prior to the concert.  So, what turned out to be a meeting with these two women to \"pick out their seats\", became a big sale and a catered dinner.   On top of that, TNN, The Nashville Network, called me to tell me they were doing a piece on these two for one of their shows and wanted to come to the center and video tape them at dinner and at the concert. So, we got a little press out of it as well.I really enjoyed meeting them and their zest for life.  Their enthusiasm for Kenny was a  little over the top to me, but that is what being a fan is all about, right?Needless to say, while making all the arrangements for this trip, the ladies and I became fast friends.  I really enjoyed working with them and they always made me laugh.  But they had this passion that I had not seen in anyone for a long time.  I started calling them \"Thelma and Louise\" -- just because of their zest for life.  The funny part was that they didn't know who \"Thelma and Louise\" were.  So, they went and rented the movie.  They called me in horror after watching the movie and said -- \"But Kris, we didn't kill anyone!\".  We all had a laugh and they have been forever, Thelma and Louise.  Now they fight over who is Thelma and who is Louise.All of this took place about ten years ago and these two women have stayed in my life.  I've gone to two Kenny Rogers' concerts with them, met them in Las Vegas when they were there seeing Kenny and continued to keep up with many of their trips.  I could go on and on about them and you would laugh along with me -- they are so great.  To date, they have seen 963 of Kenny's concerts and expect to be at 1,000 by next summer.  And yes, they both have jobs, so arranging all the travel and tickets, etc. for each of the concerts is a lot more work for them.Their mother had dementia so when I was going through my diagnosis, Thelma and Louise were right there for me.  And, continue to be.  Today, my husband and I are driving over to have lunch with them.  I haven't seen them in quite awhile but we keep up with each other.You never know who is going to play an important part in your life.  Thelma and Louise will always be in my heart.",

I don't travel as well as I used to but I have this week to rest up. We had great weather while we there.One day we went into San Francisco and it was a holdiay -- Veteran's day -- so there were many more people in the crowded shopping area and park we were at than normally would be for that particular day. The schools were out so there were lots of kids in the shopping mall areas. We went to a new place in town that just opened up and it is an entertainment/shopping district that had an ice skating rink. You all know how I like to ice skate! But, there were way too many kids on the rink for me to feel comfortable -- if it had been an average day I would have been out there in no time flat. But, it wasn't to be. I don't usually miss an opportunity to ice skate. Being in large crowds is hard for me and I need to be sure that I stay close to whoever is with me. Panic attacks usually hit me in these types of situations, but I got away with not having one. I was glad to get back to the hotel though that night.More soon after I have rested.

        "content": "I think my husband and I have become officially \"old\" people.  The reason I say that is it that every day it seems we are saying \"remember when\".  Whether it is something my son used to do as a child, what we did in college or as children we are bringing up the past.  Yesterday I was telling someone how in college we used to go \"Trick or Drinking\" on Halloween. That was certainly a long time ago!But, at least I can still remember a lot of these things -- recent things, not so much.One thing I enjoy doing every year that hopefully will bring back memories for my son, is my annual letter I write to him. Every year on his birthday (his birthday was a few weeks ago) I write him a letter.  I started this on the day that he was born.  For some reason in the hospital I this desire to write him a letter to let him know what I was feeling that day.  I don't know why but the urge was so strong I just had to do it.  I wasn't sure at the time what I was going to do with the letter but I wrote it and tucked it away in my things when I went home from the hospital.  A few weeks after he was born I found it and re-read.  I sealed it in an envelope and thought I would put it in his baby book.On his first birthday the thought occured to me to write him another letter, so I did.  I sealed this one up and put it with the other one.  Then I realized that this would become my tradition, each year I would write my son a letter on his birthday.  My thought at the time was that when he turned 21 I would give them all to him.Each year, I look forward to writing that letter come October.  I write things down over the year that I want to include in it, gather some photos from the year and any newspaper clippings or whatever I might want to include.  They don't always make it to the final letter but I enjoy collecting these items as the year goes on.  When he was smaller, I used to write all of his milestones down and tell him what I thought his future would hold for him.  This experience is really an emotional one for me because I usually pour my heart out and tell it like it is.  As he has gotten older, I chronicle his accomplishments -- but of course he will remember those on his own, but I want him to know how he makes me feel.Since my Alzheimer's diagnosis these letters have become much more important to me.  Although I started scrapbooking after my diagnosis to help me remember as well as share what I could with my family through photos, these letters will hopefully mean much more to my son later on.He's 23 now and there are 22 letters waiting for him.  I skipped a year and there is a reason but I won't go into that.  Obviously, I didn't give the letters to my son when he was 21.  I'm not sure when he will get them -- my first thought is upon my death.  But when my disease gets to the stage where I can no longer remember him, perhaps that will be the time he can read them -- while I'm still with him, but not at the same time.",

And, tennis is probably about the only thing in life I have ever had a true passion for.  Yesterday, one of our Memory Walk teams in Athens held a tennis tournament to raise funds for the walk.  Of course, I had to sign up and my husband I played in it.  Of course we didn't win -- but my frustration with it was very upsetting to me.  First of all I forgot my earplugs.  The noise from the surrounding courts bothers me and to make matters worse, we played at a local high school and their football team came out to practice just at the same time we started to play.  So not only did I have to deal with the tennis court noise, I had the students making noise and the coaches whistles blowing all the time.  And, I think that my frustration came from not the fact that I couldn't play well, but that the reality struck me that I probably shouldn't play at all.  Giving up something like tennis for me is difficult.Another frustrating thing is that my oldest brother is not well.  He has diabetes and we think the start of Parkinsons.  He won't seek medical attention in spite of our best efforts.  He obviously has a death wish -- or so it would seem.  We all feel very helpless. I feel even more helpless living so far away.  He won't listen to his family.  We know he is depressed and it hurts us deeply that he won't see a doctor about the things that he can do something about -- his depression and his diabetes.  He was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of years ago and refuses to take medicine or watch his diet.  His eyes and his feet are in bad shape and it is a shame to see him do this to himself.

I wasn't raised Catholic and I always feel awkward when I go to a service in the Catholic Church because I don't know what to do and to say at the appropriate times.  My husband was raised as a Catholic but gave it up long ago.  I was raised as a Christian Scientist and gave that up long ago.  But one thing I realized when I was at the mass yesterday was that I miss going to church.  I also realized how much I missed singing the hymns.After our son was born, I asked my husband if we could shop around for churches as I thought it was important to bring Alan up with some understanding of the religious world -- if for no other reason than for him to be able to decide for himself later on what was right for him.  I wanted us to go to church as a family and be a part of a church.   But for various reasons, we couldn't agree on a church and that hope of mine was not fulfilled.However, I found a church that I enjoyed attending and did so for awhile by myself.  But the problem I found was that in the south you don't just \"go to church\".  Church becomes you. When I would go to this church I would see people that I knew and they were constantly asking me to \"come to Sunday School\", \"come to my Bible Study group\", \"come to a church dinner\", etc., etc. I didn't want to do all that stuff -- I just wanted to go to church on Sunday morning and listen to the service.  When I explained that to my well meaning friends I think they understood and they let up for awhile but then they were back at it again.  I felt bad always having to say no and as a result I stopped going to that church.  It was the same with some other churches that I attended briefly.I'm not a deeply religious person but I do believe in certain things.  If you live in the south and don't belong to a church you are certainly an outsider.Switching topics -- Since being diagnosed I have become aware that I am much more emotional now than I have ever been.  The littlest things can bring me to tears.  I have attended several funerals lately and although I didn't know the deceased very well (knew their spouses better) I was overwhelmed by my emotion. Things on tv get me stirred up to.  Perhaps it is at those times that I realize how much we take life for granted and we shouldn't.

It will run in Headline News and is schedule to run once an hour from the 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. The Healthy Minute segment usually runs about 8 minutes after the hour.

I'll be encouraging you all to contact CNN after they run as I did with the NBC piece.The National Alzheimer's office asked me to come to Washington to speak at a meeting that would include the FDA and some of the pharmaceutical companies.  Alzheimer's drugs was the topic.  I had to decline the invitation because of a trip we have scheduled to California to see Alan and it is also just a couple of days after the memory walk.  I really hate it when I have to turn down a request like that because it is so important to me.  I feel like I have let them down by not being able to do this, but my stamina isn't what it used to be.  When I'm tired my brain doesn't work right and it gets to be too much for me.  I appreciate them asking me and I know they will find someone else to do this, but I am disappointed I can't do it.

It was nice to finally meet Scott and Michelle and to see Kristy again.  They were all wonderful to work with and helped me along in the process.Although the conference was geared to professionals in the field of Dementia Care I learned more than I thought I would.  A lot of emphasis was given to early stage dementia and those attended seemed to want to know more.  It's just a baby step in this disease.But it was exhausting.  It has taken me a couple of days to feel my feet under me again.  The day I came home from Atlanta it was pouring down rain and the fog was awful.  It took me two and half hours to get home (normally it takes one and half hours) and I was white knuckle driving the whole time.  When I got home I felt wasted.  I was tired and pretty non-communicative to my husband.  Yesterday wasn't much better -- I felt like I was in a comatose state most of the day.

Coming home on Wednesday I actually felt annoyed that there was someone else in the house (my husband) and he was invading my \"silence time\".  It was so hard to come home to \"noise\". I got to the point where I was feeling mad at my husband and it wasn't his fault.  Those of you that know my husband know how quiet it is.  It was just that I had gotten used to the sereneness of my room and no distractions.  When I got home the noise of the television, the sound of my husband's voice and even the meow of my cats was getting on my nerves and making me very agitated.  I finally had to seek some quiet time in another part of the house, and then rested as well.   This seems like such a silly thing, but it is so upsetting to me.

I have to be better about not getting myself into these situations.My son starts his second year of law school tomorrow.  In about 4.5 months he'll be able to say he's half through! He was fortunate to make the Stanford Law Review so he will be kept busy by that this year as well as his school work.On another note -- I recently read an article on Michael J. Fox and his struggles with Parkinson's Disease.  I have read many, but this one was especially poignant to me.  I so admire what he is doing and speaking out on behalf of himself and others with the disease.

We are headed out to Seattle to catch up with my son.  He is driving up to Seattle from Stanford and we are going to have a week together.  I don't do well traveling these days and perhaps that is in the back of my mind.More before I leave --I promise.",

If you've read my posts before you know that I say never to give a jigsaw puzzle to an Alzheimer's patient (at least me) because it is so frustrating. But, I felt pretty good and I had one in the closet and I decided to try it.  Talk about a brain drain!  But I did finish it and I was totally exhausted.  I couldn't believe how much it took out of me.  After finishing it up on Thursday, I went to a Memory Walk meeting with my husband.  It was at a restaurant that was very noisy.  I could barely get through the meeting and meal because of the noise and just being mentally tired.  I kept forgetting what I was saying, was confused and just normally not doing very well.  I'm glad my husband was with me because I'm not sure I would done very well getting home.That night I had a dream and in it I had Alzheimer's.  Alzheimer's has never manifested itself into my dreams.  I thought it was interesting that that night it did.  I've always been this \"normal\" person in my dreams.   I hope that doesn't keep reoccuring because it is nice to know that when I go to sleep and dream I don't have this.",

Some are dealing with denial over themselves having the disease while others are dealing with denial from their family members.I can understand the denial from the person with Alzheimer's much more than I can with the family.  Now I realize that there is always some sort of denial in the beginning, but when it is taken to the extent of denial in not helping the person with Alzheimer's because they don't believe they have the disease -- that is a little harder to take.My family has said that I never went into denial.  I think I probably did, but if I did it wasn't for long.  What is the point?  If you have a disease what is the reason for denial?  Deal with it.  Find out what you can do and live the rest of the life you have.  We always say life is too short and when you are in denial it is even shorter, because you are not enjoying the time you have with your friends and family.  Besides, it takes too much effort (for me anyway) to be in denial.It's hard to ask for help when you are in denial -- and trust me -- with Alzheimer's you need help. I don't like to admit that I do, but as each day, week and month passes I need more help.  I don't like it -- but I'm learning to deal with it.",

I've asked my son to put a link to it on this page so you can refer to it later if you would like. Don was recently diagnosed and shares some of his trials and tribulations.  I've noticed that since he is just starting this blog that some of his observations are the same as mine have been -- he's just putting it into different words.  And, the longer I write this I realized that you always don't want to hear about my problems with Alzheimer's -- I don't like tothink of them myself sometimes.  So, I haven't been speaking of them as much as of late.  But I'll get back there -- I need to -- because so much more needs to be said.In reading Don's blog though, I find it interesting at some of the comments.  One lady wrote about a relative that could figure certain things out but not others.  She said something like it was interesting he could open up some files in his brain for some things and not for others.  That is so true.....I'm always amazed at how I know how to do things but I can't do them.  Like I know what has to be done, but I can't put the actions into an order to make it happen.

The following is a quote from a recent article that was published in Ireland --Scientists in Australia have developed a once-a-day pill, which they claim may cure Alzheimer's disease. Human trials of the drug - PBT2 - are to begin next month.The breakthrough was made by a team at the Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria. The drug stops the build-up of amyloid, a protein which is widely accepted to be a major cause of Alzheimer's.\"This is a major breakthrough. Though much depends on the next phase of human clinical trials...early results indicate this drug offers hope to people with Alzheimer's disease\", said Prof George Fink, director of the institute.Early clinical tests involving animals indicate that the drug is fast-acting and is capable of suppressing the impairment of memory function that arises as a result of the disease.According to Prof Fink, PBT2 could prevent Alzheimer's from developing or delay the onset of the disease for many years.He added that pending further trials, the drug could be on the market within four years.Wouldn't this be a great thing?",

Well, I should have thought about that before doing it.  Going out in the stores later in the day for me is not good.  There are just too many people and I get confused too much.  Needless to say I was very frustrated.  I needed to go about two miles from my last errand to the doctor and it took me over an hour to get there.  I was just so confused I couldn't make it from point A to point B in a rational way.   I called my husband several times for help, but he was not reachable by phone.  It is always odd that I know enough to call him for assistance but that I can't get to where I'm going.  Although, something that did change this time is, that I know that I can always call other people for assistance, but I couldn't do that on Monday.  That thought was not something that even entered my mind, until after the episode was over.When I finally arrived at the doctor's office (half an hour late) I had forms to fill out since I had not been to that particular doctor in awhile.

I guess now I can say it is \"cognitive fatigue\" --that sounds much better don't you think?Some of Brad's other symptoms that are like mine are getting frustrated and agitated easily, not remembering the right words for things and dealing with emotion.  I guess when the brain is \"injured\" however that might come about a lot of the same symptons occur.  Lauren and I discussed how far the medical world has come on so many things but when it comes to the brain we seem to be miles behind.....or maybe it just seems that way.  There are probably a lot of other people thinking the same thing about the diseases that they have.Brad and his family are on a long road to recovery.....to me it is so much harder on the families and you all know how I feel about that.  To me, that's the hardest part of having this disease, what it does to my family.  My best to Brad, Lauren and the rest of his family -- they have certainly shown a great deal of love and support to him and he will need more as the days and months and years progress.",

The weather didn't cooperate the first part of the day so we ran about two hours behind.  All in all though I think it is goin pretty well.  Because of the weather delay I was on the course much longer than I thought I would and toward the end I was making a lot of mental mistakes because I was tired.  The mistakes weren't so bad that it messed up a player, just did some things that I wouldn't have necessarily done if I hadn't been so tired and \"over extended\" is probably a good word for it.I've seen a lot of people volunteering at the tournament I haven't seen for a long time. Many of them I can't remember their names which is frustrating and I'm probably not remembering some of them at all.  But at least I'm out there.They've treated the volunteers extremely well with appreciation.  They have also been feeding us every day and since we are a country club it is country club food, not just sandwiches.  I've tried to stay on my diet the best I could but the food is pretty tempting.  One thing they had one day this week was fried chicken.  I haven't had fried chicken in probably well over a year because of my diet, but I had a piece this week and it was like heaven!  I think I even had a dream about it that night.

I've been working on the driving range for two days and tomorrow I will be working on a hole as the tournament begins.  I suppose when Ralph retires in a few weeks, we'll be playing much more golf.  I used to play pretty well, but my concentration isn't what it used to be and that means I don't play real well now.  But at least I get out and get some exercise and enjoy the outdoors.

I've always been a tomboy and when my brothers wouldn't let me play baseball with them when I was young, I got a tennis racket and would hit tennis balls endlessly against a wall, near the baseball field so I could be close to my brothers and all the action that was going on.  My mom used to tell the story that my brothers wouldn't let me play baseball with them because I would turn cartwheels in the outfield.So I played a lot of tennis.  Sports for girls in high school were virtually non-existent at that time so I never really played on a \"team\" until my adult life.This all brings me to my tennis match today.  My husband signed us up to play in this mixed doubles league.  I have made it my practice to not play mixed doubles with my husband because it never seems to work out.  I play to win -- he plays for fun.  However, I said yes, and we started our league play today.The first set was fine -- we lost 7-5 but it was very competitive.  Then I lost it.  My concentration was shot, I put my earplugs in to help block out some of the noise.  I couldn't remember the score, I couldn't remember who was serving and I couldn't remember the last point.  I started having panic attacks and couldn't breathe.  I was so confused and so upset I started crying on the court before we started the second set.  Our opponents didn't see this (I don't think) but suffice it to say we never won another game.  I disappointed myself, but also my husband -- although he hasn't said that -- I just feel that.I think I have now become a person who \"doesn't play tennis\" but rather a person that can go out and \"hit the ball\" for an hour or so and let it go at that.So many other things that I have lost the ability to do, do not bother me as much as this.  Tennis has been a part of my life for over 40 years.  I've always been that self proclaimed \"tennis snob\" but I guess I won't be any longer.  I'm sure my tennis playing friends reading this will be rejoicing at that fact.We still have five matches to go in our league and I'm not sure how I'm going to get through them or if I will be able to do it at all.My husband has commented from time to time that I was always defined by what I did -- mainly by the jobs I have had over the years.  He worried that when I retired I would have a hard time, because I wouldn't be known for something.  I've always had relatively high profile jobs and he really felt that is what defined me.  It probably did sometimes.   But, I have always defined myself in many ways and one thing I was always proud to say was that \"I was a tennis player\".I guess I no longer am.

Sometimes that got me into trouble, but for me, what else is new? So, what I am about to write will seem like a shock to you.I'm having an increasingly difficult time saying the words that pop into my mind.  I know exactly what I want to say but I can't put the words together to make it mean what I want it to mean.  Yesterday, I was having a lunch meeting with some of the women on the Memory Walk committee for this year, and it seemed like every point I was trying to get across didn't come across the way I wanted it to.  I think they were able to get some things I was saying, but after the meeting I felt really bad because I know I must have sounded like an idiot at times.I'm also working with a national committee for a national Alzheimer's conference in Atlanta this fall.  Our work includes going over abstracts for speakers.  Since the committee is comprised of people from all over the country we are having conference calls to narrow the field of the speakers.  I have a difficult time working over the phone anyway, but to have lots of different voices coming at me makes it extremely difficult.  Then the lack of me being able to put sentences together to mean what I really want to say intimidates me so I end up being more silent than I feel I should be.  (What a shocker that is!)  I feel inadequate and very useless to the whole process when I can't contribute what I want.I've said before that this disease makes me feel stupid and when I encounter days like yesterday I do feel stupid.  I know that I'm not stupid, but it's hard not to feel that way.Having come from a journalism background as a tv news reporter and writer for many different publications this becomes increasingly frustrating.  Communications has also been something I thought I did pretty well.  Since being diagnosed I have wanted to write a book, but I know that I couldn't do that without a lot of help.  I haven't found that help yet, so I guess for now this journal is the best I can do.....and I'm not really sure how good that is when I go back and read some of the posts I've written.

That's when the old brain decided to act up more than usual and I suddenly come back to that dreaded feeling I get when I think about this disease.  On good days I rarely think about it -- but when it rears its ugly head there's no denying it.On another front for \"reality\" -- in about three weeks my husband retires.  I know I have mentioned it before, but I think I have put it out of my mind.  What a change for him and definitely a change for me.  Having someone around the house all the time is going to definitely be hard.  My husband has a hard time being in the house without noise.  He has to have the television or the radio on.  I can't function like that -- there is never a tv or radio or anything that produces noise on during the day when I am home alone.  We will definitely be created a \"no noise\" room for me to escape to.  It will certainly be different for everyone.

Not being a real fan of racing, I wasn't too sure about our excursion -- but it was great.Talladega is much larger than I thought it was going to be and we got to ride around the track at 120 MPH! That was really awesome. The slope on the turns is 34 degrees and it felt pretty amazing. Now the real race car drivers go at 195 and they are just inches apart at times while racing --that is pretty scary to me.

The things I hear are not voices but \"sounds that don't belong\" -- like a door slamming when it shouldn't be or a car honking its horn when there are no cars around.Quite frequently I hear a door in our house slam.  I am usually in the back part of the house when I hear this and go out to see if my husband may have come in and I didn't hear his car pull up.  But no, when I go look he is not home and there is no one hear but me and the cats.  And, the door that I swear I hear slam is already shut and I knew it was all day long.   I've mentioned this several times to my husband because it is so annoying but he always tells me not to worry about it -- it is probably a sound coming from the neighbor's house and it just sounds like it is coming for our house.   So, I haven't mentioned it in awhile.This weekend, our son was in Atlanta spending the night and expected to arrive home around noon on Sunday morning.  At around 5:00 a.m. my husband \"heard a door slam\" and woke me up when I heard him say \"Alan is home\".  When I looked at the clock, I knew there was no way Alan would be coming in at 5:00 a.m. when he was spending the night in Atlanta.  I rolled over and tried to go back to sleep.  My husband did not hear Alan come in or go to his room so he got up and went to look in the garage to see if the car was there.  Alan was not home -- Ralph was \"just hearing my noises\"!  I told him that it was the exact same sound I would hear during the day and how annoying it was.  He was convinced someone had slammed that door.  Now his explanation is \"maybe we have ghosts\"!",

Adam had taken a job with a company in Norcross (outside of Atlanta) after he graduated so he and Alan were able to stay connected.

I love getting cards at Christmas and yes, I am one of those people that love getting the Christmas letters from everyone.  I forget what is happening in their lives during the year and it is always so nice to catch up with what they have going on.  This year, when I sent out my Christmas letter, I decided to spare some people from reading it, so I didn't enclose a letter in many cards because I just figured that they might not care what is going on in our household.

Of course, getting it over the Christmas holiday and trying to track down the records \"immediately\" might prove to be a little difficult.  And, I certainly would have appreciated them looking at my files \"immediately\" instead of almost 30 months after they were submitted!4. I've got to try to get into the dentist today.  There is definitely something wrong with my teeth -- it is very weird -- I can't pinpoint the problem but I feel like all of my teeth hurt. I know that sounds funny, but that is the only way to describe it.  I'm not sure if he can help me, but I'm hoping maybe he can give me something for the pain to get me through Christmas.5. Going back to the cards -- one thing that certainly humbled me, was that an agent I used to work with when I booked performances sent me a card.  She left the business several years ago when she had a baby.  But, on the back of the envelope of her card, she put a note saying that I had inspired her and to read her Christmas letter - she hoped I didn't mind.  After opening the envelope and reading her first paragraph, I was touched.  She told her friends that she wasn't going to write a Christmas letter this year, but after reading mine and realizing how important mine was to her, that she decided to write one.  We became friends even in our crazy business days that I truly admire her.6. Tomorrow, I am going to meet my two \"surrogate sons\" as I have called them in previous blogs.  These two young men worked for me and I went to one of their weddings this year.  I had posted a photo of them on my site last summer.  One is in the army in Texas and another works in Pennsylvania. They will both be home for Christmas and we are getting together for lunch.  They are about a year older than my son and I have really enjoyed getting to know them not only as employees but as individuals.  We have shared many a laugh together.  The other one is getting married this year, and unfortunately he is getting married the same day that my nephew is gettng married in Illinois so I won't be able to get to his wedding.  The Army is sending one to Iraq come July.  It will probably be a long time before the three of us are together again since I won't be at the wedding.  Just like my son, I hate that they are not close by. I enjoy being around them and I am grateful they have kept me in their life.OK -- Ineed to stop now.  I realize much of what I have written probably doesn't mean much to most people but it does to me.  But thanks for reading.  If I don't get a chance to post again before Christmas --- my very best to everyone for a safe and happy holiday!",

There were about 100 people at the Town Hall meeting.One of the speakers, was a lady from South Carolina who has early stage Alzheimer's.  I enjoyed laughing with her as she talked about her ways of coping.  One thing she said she did as soon as she was diagnosed was to go and put names on the back of all of her photographs so everyone would know who they were.  I did that exact same thing!  That is what led me into doing scrapbooking.  We are all so different in how the Alzheimer's affects us but it seems like we respond in so many like ways.Before I left on Saturday I was writing some notes to people, and I just couldn't spell.  Every five minutes I was asking my husband how to spell things -- and I am a good speller.  I haven't figured out how to use the spell check in the blog program and since I have such a problem with synonyms (sp?) it wouldn't tell me if I was using the right word.  How frustrating this is to me.  It's getting much worse.  I have to write and re-write just to make sense of what I am trying to say.

        "content": "This week has been a long one.  There is so much to write that I have been putting it off.  But I decided that this weekend's adventure to South Carolina for the Alzheimer's Town Hall meeting would be a separate entry so I thought I should go ahead and fill in the rest of this week.Several weeks ago when I was going to Chicago to speak, I took the airport shuttle from Athens to Atlanta.  There were 10 women in this shuttle (poor driver) and of course you can imagine there was a lot of talking!  Someone asked me what I was going to Chicago for and I said a meeting.  Then she asked me what kind of meeting.  I told her.  Then she asked me why I was going to the meeting. I told her I was speaking.  She asked me what I was speaking about and I told her.  As always, that opens up a new conversation.  And, as always, most everyone knows or has someone in their family with Alzheimer's.  The lady asking me all the questions had a mother with the disease and the lady sitting next to me had a brother (age 64) with Alzheimer's.  He was in an assisted living home.  Obviously, the topic revolved around Alzheimer's for the rest of the ride.  I kept noticing that a lady in front of us kept turning her head to listen in on the conversation.  Eventually, she turned around and joined us.  Turns out she is with the Gerentology Dept. at the University of Georgia.  She had participated in our Athens Memory Walk.  She also asked me if I would come and speak to her class.This past Monday night, I went to Dr. Glass' class and spoke.  What a great experience it was.  The head of the department, Dr. Poon, spoke before me and talked of his research with Centenarians.  It was very fascinating. The class was a graduate level class and the students varied greatly in what fields they were heading into.  I enjoyed speaking with them and I am hoping that I will continue to be in contact with them and they can possibly help in some future fund raising opportunities for Memory Walk.  I really appreciated the opportunity to visit with them and to get to spend some time with Dr. Poon.  We talked a little about the \"cognitive reserve\" that I have mentioned in my blog several times.  He thought it would be useful to keep track every day of where \"my tank\" was on reserve and to highlight the reasoning behind it.  I think it is a good idea, I just haven't gotten around to start logging it yet!Going back to Chicago, a very similar thing happened to me as I was sharing a cab to the hotel with a lady from Boston.  She asked me a lot of the same questions the lady in the van asked me and eventually asked me to come to Boston to speak to a group of people.  She evidently works in the field of health care with an emphasis on aging.  She thought it would be interesting to get some of her staff and associates together to hear what I had to say.  Interesting how these things come about.Earlier this week I went to Atlanta to visit with the Alzheimer's Assn. Chapter President, Jan Bequeath.  After eleven years with the Association she is stepping down at the end of this month.  Jan has been someone I have admired both as a friend and a leader.  Her staff has always been there for me and she will be sorely missed.  I wish her well.  That same night I attended the \"Better Start Living\" concert -- it was a benefit concert for the Alzheimer's Association at a new venue in Atlanta.  Song writer Monte Powell started organizing this about a year ago.  Monte is a prolific writer and has many many No. 1 songs for country artists across the board.  His family has been affected by Alzheimer's and he wanted to do something to help raise money.  One of the performers he writes for is Keith Urban, so he invited Keith Urban to town for an acoustical show!  It seemed to be a success and I hope a lot of money was raised.  There will be other \"Better Start Living\" concerts to come -- possibly to a town near you!All of my cognitive reserve was completed by yesterday.  I got home from Atlanta and I think I slept the rest of the day!  I was pretty out of it.  I'll rest some more this morning and then this afternoon I'm off to Spartanburg SC for the Town Hall meeting Saturday morning.  Someone from the Chapter office is driving me over there so I shouldn't have to call on \"that reserve\" until this evening when I meet with the staff from Chicago and Washington DC for dinner.  I'm excited about the Town Hall meeting tomorrow.  I hope the turnout will be good.More when I return.",

It will be some work but something to look forward to.  I only hope that I can contribute as much as everyone else does.  I feel inferior sometimes when working with this group as they are all so accomplished, driven and intelligent.  My husband keeps telling me that I fit into that category but I don't think I do.

As you know from following this blog I'm a big fan.  Our team is ranked #10 in the pre-season polls.  We have lots of players this year -- it seems like we are always low in numbers because of injuries, but hopefully we will remain healthy this year.  I do have my problems going to games though. Some days I can't go because of the noise.  It is way too distracting to me.  Sometimes we have to come home early because I can't deal with it all.  I try -- I really do but it many times just too overwhelming.  A friend of mine who recently retired has talked to me about going to some away games with her and the prospect of it sounds great -- I am just not sure how many of those games I can do.  However, the crowds at the arenas around the league are not as large as our crowds (except a couple which we wouldn't be going to anyway) so it might not be so bad.

The goal for our walk was $75,000 and I think we will make that.  It was a great event.  Having said that -- I'm glad it is over.When I came home I told my husband my body and my brain were so tired I didn't know what to do.  I rested, took a good nap, and rested some more.  It will take my brain a few days to recover.  I bring this up, because there has been much discussion lately about \"cognitive reserve\".  I never really knew it had a name, but I figured that someone would come up with it.  It is where you can store up all this brain power for something and then it is shot and gone for several days.I am putting a link in here that I hope you will all read if you are caring for someone with Alzheimer's -- or have it yourself.  Rich Bozanich is a friend from California that serves on the Early Stage Advisroy Group with me.  Rich is a journalist and can put into words so eloquently what I can't.  The Alzforumhttp://www.alzforum.org/has an interview with Rich that to me is amazing.  The interview is going to be in five parts with the first two posted at this link.  Rich and another college Jay Smith have worked tirelessly for the last 15 months to put together an early memory loss forum in Los Angeles.  It is next week and it is sold out with 350 people signed up.  They've done a great job in putting this together and I know that they will be totally exhausted when it is over.  Many people will be better off having attended this seminar I know.  I wish I could be there with them, but they know I am there in spirit.  Please take a few minutes to read Rich's interview.  It is very enlightening.  I hate it that my words don't come out like Rich's -- but at least someone can do it!   I especially like Rich's comments in the second part of the interview when people are trying to make themselves feel better by trying to make you feel better.  I kind of had to laugh out loud because we have all been there.  Thanks Rich!Hopefully I can get my brain wrapped around a few more thoughts and write some more about the walk soon.

I have been able to see lots of folks that I haven't seen for awhile.  While visiting, there seems to be a theme in what we talked about -- disappointment in things not going the way people were hoping for.It's hard to understand why some things don't go our way.  I've never been real religious but I do believe that things happen for a reason.  Or at least, in my life I believe they do.  It might be hard to see at the time, but later on I have been able to look back at things and realize why I didn't get a certain job, a certain grade, a certain opportunity.  It might have been a few days later, a few months later or even a few years later, but the reason has always presented itself.  In talking with friends here (as well as my son this week) they have shared some disappointment in something not going their way.   Most of the time, when things have not gone my way, it has been for the better.  I wasn't always happy about it at the time, but when looking back it definitely was for the better -- I wouldn't have had a chance to meet some people, or to make as much money or to be happy.I've often written about my husband being very pessimisstic.  His response to that is \"if I don't get my hopes up about something,  then I won't be disappointed if things go bad.\" I'm not sure that is the right way to look at things, but each to his own I guess.I think you have to be positive and then live with what happens as bad as it might hurt or not feel right at the time.  Everything is not going to go your way every time.  You just have to hope that you can handle what is thrown at you.  I certainly didn't want to get Alzheimer's -- but it has happened for a reason and I accept that. I don't see many other alternatives at this point so you make the best of it.  I've certainly grown as a person and value my time with my friends and family so much more.I think, too, that we have to learn from all of these opportunities.  It certainly won't be the last time we are disappointed by something and hopefully the next time it happens you will be ready for it -- or at least realize that it is not the end of the world.  Learn from it and move on.  Life is way too short.",

It has been hard to get back into my daily routine -- thought I was coming down with a cold, but it just turned out to be exhaustion.  I'm traveling to central Illinois to visit my brothers at the end of this week, but I know I will have more downtime than when I was in Chicago so hopefully, that will not be as bad.I went to the UGA football game last night.  We don't have season tickets, but a friend of mine called and had an extra ticket so I was his date.  I haven't been to a game for a couple of years so it was nice to go.  Some friends of mine that go to every game gave me a ride and stayed with me until I caught up with my friend.  Then my friend walked me back to a meeting place for my ride home so I wasn't alone.  The stadium was sold out which means over 92,000 people were in attendance, so I was glad I wasn't alone!  I really got tired after the half and it was hard for me to follow the game.  Having the game in the evening was also hard for me because I'm not at my best in the evening.  But, I'm glad I went -- it will probably be the only game I go to all season and it was a nice night for a game.  And, we won!",

Fourteen people with Early Stage Alzheimer's had been selected to serve on this committee.  We have had a conference call to get to know each other a little better, but this weekend was the first time that all of us actually got to meet each other (except one who had another committment).  I was not sure what to expect.  Let's say that I was overwhelmed at the other people on this committment.  What top notch people to be serving on an advisory board such as this.The committee is composed of three women and eleven men.  We have retired architects, doctors, IT specialists, banking and finance executives, artists, musicians -- you name it.  I'm not sure that I quite measure up to everyone but I'm certainly going to do my best.  I was so impressed by this group and I am certainly honored to be among them.One of the members of our committee is still working and he is a police chief in a small town in Central Illinois -- not far from where I am originally from.  He is very articulate.  He has gotten a lot of national press because there is curiosity out there about him having Alzheimer's and carrying a weapon.  I would be more than happy to rely on him for my defense if I ever needed it!And, he said, after one of our meetings, that he felt that he has found a whole new community and lifelong friends after meeting for just a few hours.  I whole heartedly agree with that and am certainly looking forward to working on the tasks put before us.Those tasks will be many as there are things to be looked at like advocacy work, programming and awareness.  I appreciate the Alzheimer's Association so much for asking us to do this and getting our feedback.Now as to the bad news -- A new drug called Alzhamed has been in clinical trials for some time and many of us have been hoping that this drug would be a big breakthrough in treatment.  The optimistic side of this drug was that it had the potential to help slow the progession of Alzheimer's.  Well, the trials have not shown these results and basically the drug is not an option.  There are some other drugs in the pipeline, but much further down the pipeline -- we were all hoping for such great things. It's very sad news.Here is a link to a news story about ithttp://www.reuters.com/article/health-SP/idUSN2638111620070827",

It seems we are all rather out spoken and we each have our own little niches that we interested in.  Many are interested in helping to educate the medical field more about what we go through, some are intersted in lobbying congress for more money, everyone wants to help educate the public and raise awareness to help get funds for research.It's a very diverse group and I am honored to be one of the fourteen.One major initiative this year for the Association is to have regional town meetings to discuss Alzheimer's.

I have had increasing problems with finding the right words for things lately.  That is so frustrating. I can see it in my head but I can't find it!",

We had a garage sale with several other families and it was held at our house.  We had the opportunity to do a lot of spring cleaning, but at the same time, it created upheaval around our house because things weren't where they were suppose to be.  The house was a mess, our garage was full of \"stuff\" and things were just not \"normal\".  It is amazing how this affects me. But it is over now and the money we raised from the garage sale is a start for our Memory Walk this year.Also, the mother of a close friend of my son's, passed away last week and that always gets me much more emotional than I used to be.  She was only 55 too and it was such a shock to everyone.  She had four children and Alan's friend read a eulogy that one of her other sisters had written.  It was so sad.  Those things stick longer with me now -- I don't know if it is the disease or the fact that I am getting older and people are passing away that are close to my age or just before their time.",

The yellow green color that it leaves everywhere literally can take your breath away.  We are suppose to have rain today and that will certainly help.This week I had a test done at a local hospital on my left leg.  The leg has been swelling and at first there was reason to believe that I had a blood clot in my leg.  But after tests for that it was determined that was not the cause.  Now the doctors believe that the problem lies in my lymph system.  Anyway, I went to the hospital to have this test done -- I don't remember the name of it -- but it entailed having some fluid injected into my feet and then they watched the fluid stream through my body.  It doesn't sound so bad, but the shots were given between my toes on each foot!!!  Sounds awful.....it was awful.  I have had several cortisone shots for various things over the years and it was very close to that -- which caused me excruitating pain.  And, it also topped right up there with getting two spinal taps during my diagnosis for Alzheimer's.  What fun I have had.  Results will be in next week on my leg.

And, with it comes stories of failing health in some form or another.  Do we just neglect ourselves in all that we have to do, do we overdo things because our bodies are what they used to be or is it \"just getting old\"?I've tried to keep remember what some doctors have told me about my Alzheimer's.  That they are hoping with the drugs out there today and some to come on line soon, that their hope is for people like me to die of something else rather than the Alzheimers.  Of course, I hope this is true as the downward spiral for someone with Alzheimer's isn't exactly pretty. But some other diseases are not either.Spring has sprung in the south and with it comes the dreadful pollen.  I have never seen it this bad although my husband says it has been.  I suffer from allergies and when you can't go outside because the pollen is so thick in the air it is bad.  The range for the pollen is up in the 5000 range (whatever that means) and if you consider that the \"high range\" is 150, you realize how bad it is.  The streets, cars and any surface outside are covered with this yellow green dusting.  I remember when I was playing tennis with this pollen that you can see where the ball bounced because it would leave a mark in the pollen.  We are hoping for rain to help clear some of it out.I'm having some circulation problems in my left leg so am going to the hospital for some tests tomorrow.  The name of the test is too long for me to remember, but they will basically be shooting dye up my leg to watch the flow of it.  The doctor thinks I have lymphodema -- which isn't life threatening -- more of a pain and a nuisance.On a lighter note, my son and his girlfriend are in Hawaii on his spring break right now.  Ever since moving to California they have wanted to go since it is a lot cheaper if you are starting out in California.  I hope they have a good trip.  They have both worked hard to get there.",

Soemtimes it is just hard for me to come up with the right words.When I was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's I made it a mission of mine to get into scrapbooking of some sort.  I had lots and lots of photos and they were catalogued or captioned and you probably know the drill.  It was always something I was going to get to.  Well, I decided that while I could still remember some things I would really work at getting all those photos and kid's drawings and momentos in a scrapbook.  It took me several months but I finally got caught up.  I was relieved when it was over, because at least I knew that my family would have some memories of our life even if I couldn't remember it.My project of late has been to work on a scrapbook for a friend of mine.  It is a secret so I won't go into who it is for and what the purpose is, but since I know this person doesn't read the blog I think it is pretty safe to talk about it in general terms. I have solicited letters, stories and photos from friends to include in the scrapbook.  At times, I feel a little guilty in reading all the letters and stories about this person's life because they are so personal.  But at the same time, I am taken back by how much this person has meant to so many people during their lifetime.  You never really know what kind of an impact one person has on another until you read stories about them.  We take that kind of friendship for granted too often.I look back and I can pinpoint several people during my lifetime that changed the way I am (was) and sometimes it is not the people you expect that change your life.   I'm not sure when I was growing up we called these people Mentors like we do today, but just the same they are important in our lives.  Sometimes we don't realize what an impact they had on our lives until way after the fact.  If there are people in your life that have affected you for the positive, let them know it, before it is too late.  There's no time like the present.",

I had to take all the Christmas stuff down shortly after Christmas Day because I was starting to have panic attacks.  Have to get back to that routine you know!!!One thing I enjoy most about the holidays is hearing from friends you don't hear from often.  I love getting Christmas cards and I like to send them as well.  What worries me is when I don't hear from some one that has been sending cards and letters for years and then I don't hear from them.  I'm going to make an effort to contact them and hope that they are well.  When I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's I realized how much my family and friends meant to me.  I've said it here before that it is a shame that something has to strike you before you realize what is important in life -- but you hear many people say that.  So, it has been important to me to remain friends and reconnect with friends I have let slip by the wayside.  This past fall, a friend of mine popped back in my life that I was so grateful for.  We had been friends for years professionally and when we both switched jobs we kind of lost track of each other.  Then I ran into her in a local deli and I was so excited to see her and catch up on her life.  Unfortunately, I learned that her husband too was suffering from dementia.  She was glad to run into me as well and we shared notes and reconnected our friendship.  That has meant so much to me.If you are looking for a new year's resolution -- don't look far.

It was nice having a few days for just the three of us.On Saturday, we huddled around the television set to watchUGAplay Georgia Tech. For the first time in seven years, Georgia Tech beat Georgia. Since GT is Alan'sAlmamater -- he was extremely happy. It was finally his year to gloat -- he certainly had to wait a long time.On Saturday night Alan and I went to a \"come see Josh\" party. The photo above was taken there. If you have been following my blog, there are two young gentlemen that used to work for me that I continue to follow through their life's journeys. They are both a year older than Alan and when Alan went away to college, these two young men, Chris and Josh worked in the box office of the theatre that I was managing. They had many friends in common and they kind of became my \"surrogate sons\" for lack of a better word. I'm not sure they would agree that that is the proper word, but it works for me! Since that time Alan,  Josh and Chris have all gotten married in the last year or so. Chris now lives in Ft.Lauderdalewith his new wife Katie and he is going to medical school. Josh was home for some R&R as he has been deployed in Afghanistan. His wife Melissa just bought a new house and we went to see him and to see the new house on Saturday night. It is not often we can get together with everyone spread all over the world. Josh returns to Afghanistan in a week or so and will be finished with his deployment in July. These young men have been extremely kind to me over the years and are great about keeping in touch. I only wish the best for them. Since Chris and Josh are both huge Georgia fans, the defeat to Georgia Tech was a little more than they could handle.Now Alan has returned to Washington DC and I need some rest.",

Alan is flying in from Washington DC on Thanksgiving morning and Ralph will be going to Atlanta to pick him up.  That means that no one would be around to help me get everything together for a meal.  So, I knew that I couldn't host friends coming over.  The realization of that bothers me a lot.

I just had this sensation that someone was standing on my chest.  So, I went to the hospital on Monday morning. Going to the hospital is never fun.  There are two hospitals in Athens and we usually go ot the same one every time -- although I'm not going to say which one.  We have never really had a bad experience at this hospital -- until this trip.  The good news about the whole experience is that I didn't have a heart attack and there is no damage to my heart.  I have extremely low blood pressure and always have.  That could be my culprit.  But I'm fine now and enjoyed being in my own bed for a full night's sleep last night.  The bad news is that the as I mentioned the experience on this trip was awful.  I'm not going to go into it hear, but I did take lots of notes and plan to write to the hospital.  There is another option in town, and perhaps next time I'll take that option.  I felt my \"Alzheimer's\" kicking in when I became very frustrated and stressed while there.  It wasn't pretty!!!Many of you have asked about Alan and Jennifer.  I know I didn't post much when we returned from Washington but it was a quick trip.  Their apartment is nice -- really small -- but nice and in a nice new apartment complex.  The roof has an area where you can go sit and there are even hammocks!  I liked that part.  I'm not sure how much of the year you can enjoy being on the top of the roof and not freeze to death -- but the weekend we were there it was delightful.  They live a close walk to the National Zoo and we walked down there to see the pandas.  Alan commutes every day on the metro.  There is a metro station connected to their apartment building and his office sits on top of a metro station so he really doesn't have to deal with the elements too much on his daily commute.  Jennifer has not found a job yet.  I hope with the economic downturn we are in that she will get one -- it may take her awhile but we are hoping the best for her.  Alan finds out this week if he passed the bar exam.  He enjoys his job with Hogan and Hartson.  He's working a lot but I don't think much more than when he was in law school since he spent so much time studying.Memory Walk is in a couple of weeks.

I've always enjoyed letter writing -- as many of you may know.  When we were young and in school we were encouraged to have pen pals -- remember those days?  In fact, my oldest brother married his pen pal who lived in England and they have been married 40 years!  Right now, my sister-in-law's brother has been writing to me from England and it is so nice to go to the mail box and actually have a letter waiting for me some days.  I've enjoyed writing to him as well.I've written before about my letter writing to my son.  The day he was born I wrote him a letter and every year on his birthday I have written him a letter.  I put them all in the safety deposit box not knowing when the appropriate time to give them to him would be.  Since my Alzheimer's diagnosis these letters have become even more precious to me.  I'm able to share my feelings with him while I still can and when I can no longer remember what is going on at least he will know how I was feeling at some point.  I have struggled to know when the best time he should received these letters.  At first I thought it was when I died.  He knew that I wrote them and at some point he would get them.  Then, when he turned 21 I thought that would be the time.  But, I decided to give them to him the night before his wedding this last August.  We were alone together and I had gone to the safety deposit box to get all 25 letters out and put them in a box.  I thought since he was starting a new chapter in his life, that I would give them to him.  It was one of the hardest things I have done.  I shed quite a few tears and I'm not sure why.  His first reaction to me was -- \"I don't want those now!\".  I don't know if he thought that this was an \"end\" of some sort or what.  I told him that he didn't have to read them now -- he could read them five, ten or twenty years down the road.  I added a letter that he was to read first -- and that bascially told him that I didn't care when he read them, but once he did I wanted him to tell me that he had read them if I am still alive.  His other comment to me was \"Does this mean you are going to stop writing me letters?\" My response to that was \"I didn't say that!\" But, he has 25 letters from me now and who knows -- since his birthday is coming up I might write another to put away in the safety deposit box.  I guess my reason for giving him the letters now is for him to decide when the right time to read the letters would be -- not for me to decide.  Perhaps when my mind is to the point of not remembering him or what is going on it will bring some peace to him -- knowing how much he has meant to me through the years and how proud of him I am -- I may not be able to tell him that at some point and at least I know I'll have it covered!I guess what made me write this post is that I just finished reading the book \"Wednesday's Letters\".  It is about a man who wrote his wife a letter every Wednesday that they were married.  He wrote them thinking that he would die before his wife and she would have them to read as a sign of his love.  I won't spoil the book for you -- but it turns out they die together and the children find the letters.  What ensues is a beautiful story and reminded me so much of my letters to my son.If you miss getting letters in the mail from friends, write one yourself to a friend.  You might get one back.",

I then got in my car to come home and there was a major accident on the major interstate I was coming home on.  While that didn't bother me too much, I was tired and I just wanted to get home.  Obviously I made it home -- but it really takes the fun out of traveling!We are getting into wedding mode here at the house.  My brother-in-law from St. Louis comes in on Wednesday and Alan will be home.  That is going to be four people in the house as opposed to our usual two.  I've told my husband already how hard that is going to be on me and that I need my quiet time and I need his help.  It's way too much confusion to have that many people in the house for me, let alone clean and cook.  I know my brother-in-law will understand when I just have to go into a room and shut the door for quiet time.  By week's end we will be staying at a hotel in Atlanta for the wedding and it will be easier for me to escape.   I really enjoy having company and seeing people, but it isn't like it used to be.  I get so tired so quickly and I'm not myself.  I hate this!!!!",

Between thunderstorms in Chicago and Atlanta and a very large car crash blocking traffic in Atlanta it was a long day.  More about that later.I was in Chicago for the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease.  Over 5,000 people from around the world were there -- it was pretty impressive.  They are all trying to find a cure for this disease.  That's encouraging.  Of course, most of the sessions were so technical they were way over my head, but I hung in there for a few of them.  There are some exciting things in the pipeline -- it will just take years for the drugs to make it through our complicated process of clinical trials and the FDA.  I have to keep in my thoughts that there will be a breakthrough of some significance in the next ten years or so.Thanks to the BBC for their remarkable five part series on Alzheimer's this week.  I have had lots of comments on the show.  They filmed my story while I was in Washington in May for the Public Policy forum and it ran on Tuesday of this last week.  Here is the link if you missed it.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7532226.stmOn the page that this comes up on you will also find links to the other stories that ran.  It was a powerful series in all.There was a lot of press last week on Alzheimer's with the conference going on.  And, Memory Walk commercials were running last week as well.  If you want more information on the conference you can get it atwww.alz.org.  I will be writing more once I am rested.",

I haven't had much time to reflect on them, but as I do think about them, I wonder when those events will be a long lost memory for me.  It's kind of weird to think of it like that, but what will I remember in the years to come of those events?  It's anyone's guess I suppose.  The words \"living in the moment\" seem appropriate at times like this.  These events will be memories for some, but most likely not for me.

We were without power for 6 hours.  It was about 9:00p.m. when it happened.  It was extremely warm in the house so we had to open all the windows.  The bad part was that a fire truck was sitting idly in front of our house until the power company could come.  The power company showed up around 2:00 a.m. with chain saws and started cutting up the tree. Finally the power was restored, all trucks left and I could finally go to sleep. The tree fell on a car parked on the street, but luckily there were no fires and no one was hurt that I am aware of.  We think the wind blew the tree over but ther was some powerful lightning in the area but none of the neighbors heard anything that sounded like lightning striking the tree.Balance issues were plaguing me a great deal this weekend.  I'm not liking this one bit.  I met three other ladies for brunch yesterday and had difficulty walking to the buffet line and out the door.  I held on to someone to help me the rest of the way.  Around the house I'm just sure not to \"walk with sharp objects in my hand\".I forgot to mention that we had our captain's meeting for this year's Memory Walk about a week and a half ago.  With the economy the way it is this year it may be a little more difficult to raise money but we are certainly going to try.  A new friend of mine from Atlanta came over to speak to our group -- her mother is \"young\" like I am and has the disease.  She did a great job.Last week I went to an assisted living center about 20 miles away that has a monthly support group and talked to them.  They were great and it did me good to get out and speak.  I say that it is as much therapy for me as it is for them.It's likely to be a slow week this week with the holiday.  Jennifer and Alan are driving to Georgia from California starting today. They are hoping to be in Atlanta by week's end.  Ralph wants to play golf tomorrow, but I'm not sure if I can play with the balance issue.

Of course, I didn't know him, but was very sad by his loss, as was it seems the nation.  I have been watching lots of the coverage that has aired on all the stations recently and realize what a \"larger than life\" person he was.  He touched so many lives.  His son Luke, is a testament to his father.  I cried openly yesterday as I listened to his son giving a loving tribute to his father.  You look at a young man like that and realize his future is bright and going to be filled with great things.  How proud his family must be of him.  For someone to only be 22 years of age and command the respect he did is truly amazing.  There are many wonderful and amazing young people out there that we don't get to see much of.  They are making their way into the world and we will hear from them in due time I am sure.I'm sure my son is reading this at some point and he knows how proud I am of him.  I thought of him a lot yesterday while watching Luke Russert speak, thinking that he reminded me a lot of Alan.  Alan has a few years on him and has not had the privileges that Luke has enjoyed but they both seem to have worked hard to get where they have gotten and are very mature for their age.  I know that all parents are proud of their children and we probably don't tell them enough what they mean to us.  It's never too late to tell them.  Alan shared with us last night that he was ranked in the top ten percent of his graduating law school class at Stanford and for a class size of 180 that is pretty good.....it's actually better than pretty good!  I think I used the word amazing last night but I don't think that is the proper word either! It is well deserved.  You did good kid! Now go pay off that law school debt!!!",

I felt especially sad this weekend when I heard the news about NBC's moderator of Meet the Press, Tim Russert's passing.  Of course I didn't know him, but I felt as if I did.  And, I know from watching him for so many years, he was so proud of his son Luke.  I kind of felt like part of my family passed away with him and I know that sounds silly.  But, I really enjoyed watching him.  I particularly liked his book \"Big Russ and Me\" about his father and their relationship.  I remember reading that and thinking that many times he was describing my relationship with my father.....which was indeed special.

So, I was very interested in his book.  It talks about the special relationship he has with his dad, and how the sports career that he has had has influenced his life.  It is an easy read and I really enjoyed the book.  If you are not a sports fan, though, I am not sure you would enjoy it as much.  Since I'm kind of a sports junkie I could relate to many of the stories he told because I remember them and I've kept up with lots of the players in the book over the years.  His relationship with his father, and other people, like former President Bush (#41) is very interesting to read about.  The struggles they have faced with Alzheimer's in the Nantz family are no different than the ones faced by you and I, but he puts a different spin on it.  I would certainly recommend the book.It has been extremely hot here (as it has in other parts of the nation).  I got a little dehydrated over the weekend so it has taken me a few days to recover.  I'm suppose to be playing golf tomorrow but it is only suppose to be in the low 90's -- as compared to over 100 degree temperatures for several days here this past weekend.Things are kind of quiet around our household these days.

I haven't published all of them for various reasons, but please know how much that means to me.  Hearing from others diagnosed young is always nice, although I wish it weren't the case.

I hope that those of you that are looking at this and are seeking more help about Alzheimer's will go one step further and contact the Alzheimer's Association if you need more information.After my initial diagnosis the first place I went to was my local Alzheimer's Association and asked for the help.  I basically said, \"I'm 46, have Alzheiemer's --what am I suppose to do\".  And, although they can't offer a cure, they have certainly been with me every step of my journey since finding out I had this disease.Many of us are writing about our experiences since being diagnosed.  Some days it is harder than others to put into words what we are feeling and experiencing.  So, there are some days you will read this and not see anything about Alzheimer's.  I can't dwell on it all the time, and the reason for this blog is more to let my friends and family in on what I'm going through when it is appropriate to do so.  Early on in my diagnosis they would ask me \"How are you feeling?\" and I would just say \"fine\" instead of going on in detail how difficult some things had been for me.  Through this, though, as things happen I can share the experience of living with Alzheimer's.  It's not always fun sharing, but sometimes it can be funny.  It's easier to laugh at myself when I do stupid things, than to admit how stupid I feel when I do things!  I don't always get it in the right words, but I try, and that, in essence what this blog is all about.Thanks to Lauran for writing the article and hope that it helps start more of a dialogue about early stage Alzheimer's.",

She got to meet a lot of people that she has only heard about and some that I haven't seen in a long time.  One of my sister-in-laws is originally from England.  She and my brother have been married for almost 40 years.  Two of her brothers and one of her sisters came over for the wedding. One of her brothers was here 38 years ago when I was just 14 -- mind you he was only 18 at the time!  I met her other brother at some point when he came visiting and I had never met her sister.  So, it was certainly a special time for all of us.  The wedding was great -- real laid back but everyone had fun.  I'll post a few photos when I get back.it will be nice to get back to a routine.

I've become much more emotional though in the last few years so it doesn't take much!!!! I lost my necklace that a dear friend gave me about ten years ago.  I never took that necklace off -- i loved it so much.  I had always admired other women who had something from their husbands like a necklace that they never took off.  My husband never gave me anything like that.  One year for my birthday a very dear friend from Illinois sent me a necklace that had a small pendant on it.  It was oblong and had the word love on one side, and then the word love was spelled in Chinese on the reverse.  It was very simple but beautiful and i fell in love with it when I saw it.  I knew that once I put it on I wouldn't take it off.  i got so many compliments on it.  Then, the chain broke when I was in Peoria this week and I lost the pendant.  I have no idea when or where it broke but it did and I was so sad to have that gone.  It really meant a lot to me.  I got very emotional over that.  I know that sounds silly, but it wasn't just the necklace, it was the thought that my friend would have taken time to buy it for me - he has such good taste and he knows how much I have worn that.  I'm going to hate to have to tell him.Enough about that.  I'm using Alan's keyboard and I don't like it, hence the capitalization errors in this post.

Adjusting to all of that will be hard after my almost week of solitude!  This wedding, however, will probably be the last time that my whole family will be together.  It's kind of weird to think about that.  I have two brothers, one that is 13 years older than me and another that is only two years older.  My oldest brother is not in good health so I don't think he will be able to travel to Alan's wedding this summer.  I have a niece who is living in Nevada who will be back for the wedding in Illinois, but probably not for Alan's wedding either.

All were relatively accepting of what we had to say except CongressmanWestmoreland.  He flat out told us that he would not support our increase for funding because he didn't think the NIH was using the money wisely.  The others pledged their support for increased funding and all said they needed more information on the two year wait ban.  Our meetings were interesting to say the least.

She is a cancer survivor and has some struggles of her own.  It was so nice to recieve her note and for her to take the time and trouble to contact me after the event.  I look forward to getting to know her better.Several weeks ago I mentioned that I was reading the Story of Forgetting, a new book out about Early on set Alzheimer's.  I finished the book and I didn't like it all that much.  It was very complicated for me to follow and it was certainly a different approach to the subject.  Many books are very emotional that deal with this subject and it wasn't -- which is o.k. -- it was a little too technical at times if anything.  And, there was a lot of symbolism in it and I'm not sure I caught all of it.  It was a very hard read for me.  My favorite book so far is Still Alice by Lisa Genova and Losing My Mind by Thomas DiBaggio.  Someone left a note on my blog about the latter book and it was one of the first books I read after being diagnosed.  My son had given it to me for Mother's Day the first year of my diagnosis.

When we were together last week we were talking about his CD's and he told me he was going to send me some.  And, they came today.  I didn't really expect them -- but now they will be downloaded on to my IPOD for my upcoming trips.We are getting ready for the trip to California.  I'm looking forward to it.  We probably won't be out there for awhile since Alan and Jennifer will be moving to the East Coast.  I'll miss an occasional visit out there.I'm also trying to gear up for the Public Policy Forum in Washington DC the Alzheimer's Association is having the next week.  I'll be home for two days and then off to Washington.  It will be a very busy time for me and I hope I can keep up.  I'm going in a few days early as the Association has interviews set up for me with the Associated Press, AARP, and the BBC.  Alan is coming with me on this trip to help me maneuver my way around.  It will be fun to have some quiet --if you can call it that -- time with him.  At least we will be together on Mother's Day and that means a lot to me.  During the conference he and I will be going with members of our State Alzheimer's office to lobby on Capitol Hill for more funding for Alzheimer's research.  We have meetings set up with Congressmen Price, Lewis, Westmoreland and Deal as well as Senators Isakson and Chambliss. A very busy agenda as you can see.  During the Washington trip we will also have our last meeting of the Early Stage Advisory Group that I have been associated with the past year.  It has been a rewarding experience and I have gotten to meet some great people who also serve on that committee.Our state Alzheimer's Association has a new Executive Director that I met last week.  I'm anxious to get to work with her as well.  A lot still needs to be done!!",

I just usually give the clerks a twenty and they give me change back.  Today I was in Borders bookstore and my bill came to $27.45.  I handed the lady $17.00 in cash.  She tried to explain to me that I was short -- I understood what she was saying but I couldn't wrap my mind around it in order to give her more money.  I just stood there not believing I couldn't figure it out.  Needless to say, I got frustrated and took the money back and gave her a credit card.  I always joke that \"God made credit cards\" for those with Alzheimer's that can't handle money.  It makes you feel so stupid that you can't figure something as simple as that -- and I didn't want to tell the lady why I couldn't make the change in the first place!   How frustrating.The book I did buy at Borders is called \"The Story of Forgetting\" about a family dealing with Early On Set Alzheimer's with several members of their family.  If anyone has read it yet, please let me know what you think.  I've read some good reviews on it.Speaking of money........$7.99 for a watermelon at the grocery store? I don't think so! Talk about sticker shock!  If gas prices weren't bad enough!And, the last thing about money -- I have to have yet another crown -- another $1,000 to my dentist!  What fun.

I had forgotten how much better it is for me when there is no one in the house with me......silence is golden.  After I retired, my husband was still working and I had about two years here at home by myself.  The television was never on, the radio was never on and my peaceful day was bliss.  After he retired that all changed -- I had to suddenly become use to the noise of the television, someone else in my space, and the constant need to be \"on\" -- since I had someone else around who was expecting me to communicate.  If you knew me before I had Alzheimer's you would have agreed with me that being in a quiet still environment would not have been what I wanted, I would have gone crazy in no time flat.  But the distractions that just one person has on me is tremendous.  This week while he has been gone most of the day have been so much better for me.....I haven't been as tired as I usually am and have just felt better.  There's nothing I can do about the situation since my husband is retired -- I know he isn't going to get another job!  We have tried \"quiet rooms\" and that works to some extent, but it's not perfect.  My husband likes to do things together so when he plays golf he wants me to go with him.  Sometimes, I just find myself having to say no because I need that quiet time.

We were very pleased with the turnout and the results.  I was so pleased that so many people spoke up and shared their stories.   The Association did a great job in getting prepared and facilitating the meeting.  I was especially moved by the people who find themselves still waiting for social security and for the system to catch up with them.  It is so sad that this is the way it is, when it doesn't have to be.  Many were forced from their jobs and the stories become all too familiar.Thanks to those who came up to me and said they have been following this blog.  I never know who is going to read this and to those that do I say thank you.  Many times I don't know what I'm going to write when I sit down at the keyboard.

I realized about mid way through the session that I didn't have as much \"reserve\" as I thought I did so it was hard to keep going.  I was able to catch a catnap on the way home from Athens which helped a little.  But then, I tried to watch NCAA basketball last night and kept falling asleep.

One thing that was striking to me is when they interviewed his wife Trish she said  something to the effect of -- if we sat around and were depressed about this we would be missing out on a lot of quality time together.

In the top photo you will see one of the miniature landmarks done with all natural materials -- berries, nuts, acorns, twigs, leaves, etc. There were several on display including the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, Supreme Court and others. There were also trains running around the buildings and the rest of the decorations.I did pretty well on this trip -- but there wasn't much expected of me.

He has been spared from this disease, but he watches members of his family suffer. I've had the opportunity to review the book and it is one you will want to read.....you can preorder it now athttp://www.thethousandmilestare.com/. Gary's cousin Chuck has been active with the Alzheimer's Association as someone who is living with the disease. Chuck's grandmother went to Washington DC years ago to talk with legislatures about Alzheimer's and it has come full circle with Chuck as he has done the same thing -- talked in front of a Senate Subcommittee to increase funding for Alzheimer's research. The story of the family is heartwrenching but beautifully told by Gary Reiswig. Order it now for a holiday gift -- but get out the tissues because it will tug at your heart.",

        "content": "My husband likes to \"tinker\" with things.  It drives me crazy because there are certain things he just can't leave alone.  When he wants to change things he just does, without consulting me of course. And, since change is a problem for me, this creates problems.He recently changed our Cable television service.  Which means a new remote. Since he is the \"king of the remote\" (what man isn't though!) this creates a problem for me because \"I'm not doing it right\" or \"you don't know how to use it\" is muttered quite frequently in our house.  I try -- but when you don't get an opportunity to even touch the remote most of the time, it is hard to learn -- let alone learning something new.Then, my husband upgraded our computer from Vista to Windows 7.  Which I know is an improvement -- but it is something else to learn.  Things aren't in the same place I'm used to them being.  Then my husband decided to install several new programs that he wanted to use. One of the problems with that was that when he installed this one of these programs, it would not allow me to turn the sound off on the computer.  (I can't deal with the sounds coming from the computer -- it sounds silly, but I lose my concentration).  After complaining my husband finally took it off the computer until he could talk with it's maker and find out what the problem was.  But, many times, when he makes one slight change in something -- it changes other things that affect me -- and because they are \"little things\" to most people, he doesn't seem to think it is a big deal -- but those little things are big things to me.  It is very frustrating.So, the last few weeks I have been confused. As a result, I get confused about a lot of things and I get anxious about that because things are not \"normal\" -- they've changed.  I say the definition of normal changes all the time for me so I guess writing that last sentence doesn't make much sense -- but it is frustrating.  I just feel like I'm a few steps behind everyone else.  I need my space, my quiet and all things to stay the same......I know that is too much to ask for.....especially in my household.   I've tried to explain that it would be like going into someone's house who was blind and moving all the furniture around without telling them.  (or at least that is what I think it would be like)  Little things make a difference in the life of someone with Alzheimer's.",

I started having panic attacks on the second hole, because it \"wasn't right\" -- it wasn't my normal routine.  I thought I could work through it but I couldn't -- I hit two shots straight into the woods and then had such panic attack I thought I was going to die because I couldn't get my breath.

I learned a lot from that.But a few months a friend from my hometown passed away.  We had gone to elementary school and high school together.  Word of his death hit me very hard although it had probably been over 25 years since I had seen him.  He was quite successful in business as I think we all knew he would be.  He was every kid's friend and I don't think I ever heard anyone say anything bad about him.  I've recently tried to reach out to some of my old classmates through Facebook and \"talking\" with them via Facebook I learned that they too were hit hard by his death.  I guess that speaks volumes about him as a person.  I'm sorry I didn't make it back home to his funeral.  I had sent a note to his parents and received a lovely note in return about the support they had been given and how touched they were that so many old classmates came to pay their respects or contact them.

I don't know if it works for everyone but it certainly has helped me.  I was having such a difficult time concentrating for more than an hour or so, it has definitely helpe me.  One of the side effects is that it will keep you awake so sometimes, even though I still feel like I need my afternoon nap, that is difficult to come by.  Sleeping at night though hasn't been a problem if I take my pill early in the morning.  It took a little while to get the dosage to where it has worked, but for now, it is helping.2. Next questions was about travel since I have been talking about it a lot lately.  Someone wanted to know \"how well I travel\".  I wish I travelled better -- it is getting harder and harder to do if I go to a place I am unfamiliar with.  My husband was with me on the last two trips -- but the one up to Cape Cod was definitley harder because I had never been before.  Plus, all the tourists (me included) made it more difficult.  I don't do well in crowds -- I get a feeling of being overwhelmed and the noise is very distracting.  I find myself having panic attacks.  I know how to deal with them so I do, and having someone along certainly helps and can get me out of situations if need be.  Also, not overcrowding my schedule helps and lots of sleep.3. Do I speak to groups? was another question I have had recently.  My answer is yes -- and I love to do it.  I have said that as long as I can I want to be able to speak about this disease to help educate the public.  I'll go just about anywhere and talk to just about anyone.  As long as my expenses are covered I'm usually good to go.  I try to bring a bit of humor into my talks so it isn't \"a downer\" and try to share some day to day experiences with the audience.  Just leave me a message with contact information if you are interested and I promise I won't broadcast that information out to all the readers of this blog.4. Memory Walk -- I've had several people ask me who can walk in a Memory Walk.  Anyone can walk in any walk across the country!  Of course, Memory Walk is the major fund raiser for the Alzheimer's Association but you do not have to raise money if you don't want to --- you can just find a walk near you and come out and support the cause.  If you do raise, $150 you will get an official \"Memory Walk\" t-shirt.  Walks are held all over the country in the fall -- go towww.alz.orgor find a walk near you.

During my diagnosis process I had two spinal taps.  An analysis of the spinal fluid showed that I carried one copy of the APOE 4 gene.  APOE4 is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's. About a quarter of the population inherits one copy of the APOE4 gene. This increases their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by up to four times. However, you can have the APOE4 gene and not develop Alzheimer's -- you are just at greater risk.  There are other genes out there associated with Alzheimer's and I'm not sure how detailed my analysis got.  It showed a high level of Tau (I think that is right).  I am adding a link to a publication put out by the National Insitute of Aging/National Insititute of Health that can explain it a lot better than I can.  Here is the linkhttp://www.nia.nih.gov/Alzheimers/Publications/geneticsfs.htmBoth of my parents died at a relatively young age (early 60's) and my father was adopted so we don't know anything of his family history.  It's possible in looking back by me and my two brothers that my grandfather may have shown signs of what they called back then \"hardening of the arteries\" or a dementia but we aren't sure.Doctors don't do genetic testing though just to see if you have the disease.  I say that, but then I also know people who have found doctors to do it.

I used to \"see\" things with words -- if I had a thought I was trying to say or get a point across it was words that I was forming in my brain and almost reading them back in order to explain something or even with a regular conversation.  Now, I see more images in my mind rather than words.  This makes it more difficult for me because I then have to convert those images to words and then get it out of my mouth!  How simple is that?  Not that simple for me.  Last night I had this whole storyboard of images in my mind with this story I was going to tell my husband.

I'm sure this sounds strange to most of you reading this, but I can't figure out another way to say it.I tried playing golf yesterday -- my concentration just wasn't there.

My back story is that I was diagnosed 7 years ago with Early On Set Alzheimer's (not referred to as Younger On Set Alzheimer's) because I was diagnosed at an age before 65.  I was 46 years old at the time.Since I've kind of been following along with this project since its inception, I wasn't sure what the finished piece was going to feature.  Like many projects, the focus of the this documentary started out entirely different --or at least that is what I remember.  But, the finished product is something everyone should see.  If people and mainly legislatures that see this don't realize this is a disease we need to take seriously, then I am not sure of what will convince them.I'm looking forward to the future segments of this piece.Some of the lines in this first episode that struck home to me were:\"That's what is so disgusting -- I feel so good......\"The disease does \"not take her intelligence away\" -- this is hard to accept when you can't do the simple things in life -- you know you aren't stupid --it is just the disease talking\"I have to read this a million times\" in referring to a recipe -- I hate to have to do that!\"I never feel like I'm giving up\" - you can't or you will.\"I don't want to be a burden\" -- we all carry this I think\"One day at time\" -- live in the moment\"Your judgment becomes an issue\"  -- how true\"my life is not that important in the grand scheme of things\" -- you want to think so, but you have to know that it isn't.I'm sure others with this disease will see what fits them.  Since we aren't around others like ourselves at this stage it is almost comforting to know we aren't alone although we feel it.For those of you that are reading this blog that need help, please seek help with either a doctor's office, an association like the Alzheimer's Association or wherever you can find what you need.

Since I don't see him that often, it bothers me that I know my disease must seem worse to him each time he sees me.  And, I always wonder when the next time I see him if I will remember him.  I know my disease hasn't really progressed to that point, but you can never stop worrying about that.  And, what this terrible disease does to the family.  I hate it.  I hate it with a passion. My mother always told me never to use that word, but I do hate it.",

It was nice having him home this past weekend -- an early Mother's Day present for me.  Just spending time with him is enough.  I wish I could take the credit for him being the man he is today -- but I know that he has done most of that himself.  I'm real proud of him.My relationship with my mother was pretty bad.  We were like oil and water.  I was never good enough.  We went long periods of time without speaking.  And, it is sad.  But, I tried.  I don't remember early Mother's Days with her, but as I became an adult they became harder and harder.  I never, ever bought her a present she liked.  She would yell at me for buying certain things because \"you know I don't like this\" is what would come back to me.  If I knew that I wouldn't have bought it for her -- but I guess she thought I was doing it on purpose.  If I chose the route of sending flowers I would get the response \"you don't take the time to go buy me a present so you take the easy way out and call the florist\".  As you can see a no win situation.  Before she passed away twenty years ago we had become friends somewhat I guess, but never had that mother daughter bond.  As a result, Mother's Day was always a problem for me -- I was damned if I did and damned if I didn't.My first Mother's Day as a mother 25 years ago didn't go so well either.  My husband is not a person that usually buys presents or thinks about getting a card or wishing someone a happy birthday.  I always bought the presents for his mother, sent the cards and was sure that he called her on Mother's Day.  But, I was sure that my first Mother's Day would be different.  Was I wrong.  After going most of that day without even a \"Happy Mother's Day\" from his lips (Alan was 7 months old at the time) I was sure that he had something planned for that evening.  About 4:30 he asked me what we were having for dinner.  At that point I knew there were no surprises.  I asked him if he was ever going to wish me a Happy Mother's Day and his response was \"You're not my mother\".  I don't think I need to say anymore!So, all my friends out there that are Mother's -- even though you are not MY mother, I wish you all a great day on Sunday.",

The development director in the Macon office asked Alan to come from Washington DC and speak before the concert. Last year, I spoke before their benefit concert so it was nice that they asked him to speak. I was so proud of him -- as every mother would be -- but he put a lot of his emotions into the speech and it was very well received. Lots of people came up to him afterwards and told him how touched they were by his remarks. I know how hard that must have been for him to write and I appreciate him and love him so much.

They are in their late 20's early 30's and have families of their own.  As I am, we are all struggling with the problems Bill is facing.  They want answers and so do I.  Unfortunately the answers are somewhat elusive.  I feel bad in that Tom and I are the \"adults\" if you will in this situation and we are not able to help Elizabeth and Jonathan with the answers they need.  I feel so helpless. I feel like I should be able to provide the support they need and I can't.  I've never really felt like the \"grown up\" giving out advice. But, they were looking for it and I couldn't help. No one can -- and that is the difficult part.As I look at the situation, I realize that in my own life people feel helpless because they can't help me either.  But, I'm not looking for help in terms of what people can do for me.  I just need people to be around me for friendship and companionship -- not to forget about me because I'm sick.  There will be days when my family needs help and I hope my firends are there to help them when the time comes.  I feel bad that I am going to be a burden on people and hope that it isn't too bad.

We have had so much rain in the last week or so that in the background you can see the water standing in our front yard.  I don't know if these geese made a detour on their trip up north or what but they were certainly looking for food.  We feed the crows, the squirrels, other cats and whatever comes our way in the back of our house.  We usually feed them cat food -- I know it sounds weird but they eat it.  The geese didn't seem to care that much for it.  But they were lovely to watch before they flew away.Today I went to a funeral.  The father of a man I used to work for passed away.  The service was lovely.  He was loved my many and it showed.  Life is just too short.Friday Night Lights is a show that airs on Friday nights about high school football in Texas.  Last week while I was speaking at the Alzheimer's Conference there I had the pleasure of meeting one of the character's grandfather.  His grandson, Jesse Plemmons, is a Champion for the Alzheimer's Association. Jesse's grandmother had Alzheiemer's.  Coincidentally, in the show there is a story line that involves another character on the show with his grandmother who has Alzheimer's.  Although it is not clearly stated that that is her condition, it is understood to be -- at least by me.  Anyway, the show has been dealing with this story line in a very dignified manner.  But last week it struck a chord with me.  I could see myself in the character and it is scary.  Just as I saw myself in the Still Alice book.  You can talk about this disease a lot, but when you see yourself, it is scary and becomes even more real.  It's hard to explain, but it is also hard to watch.HBO is coming out with a series beginning in May about Alzheimer's.  They have been working on this for about two years.  I have been to several conferences where they were shooting.  I believe it starts May 10th and it is a four part series.  It will be good I'm sure as they have put a lot of time and effort into it.  I'm not sure if it is something I can watch either -- I know I'll tape it and watch it over time, but I'm not sure if I can watch it all at once.Terry Moran, one of the hosts of ABC's Nightline program just did a short series on Alzheimer's.  He has Alzheimer's in his family and he goes the through the process in his piece about getting his DNA tested to see what his chances of getting Alzheimer's are.  Here is a link to the piecehttp://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=7175910.  He also interviews Meryl Cromer, a member of Newt Gingrich's Alzheimer's Study Group (ASG).  I had the pleasure of working with Meryl on a prelude committee to the ASG about a year and a half ago.  She is a true crusader.  And, in the piece she also finds out what her chances are for developing Alzheimer's.  She now cares for her husband and mother who both suffer from the disease.  Please note that the tests that they had only were indicators of developing Alzheimer's not that they would definitely get Alzheimer's.  During my diagnosis I had a spinal tap which indicated that I carried one of the genese for Alzheimer's but it didn't necessarily mean that I would get Alzheimer's -- it was just one of many markers in my diagnosis.  The story is interesting and I thank ABC and Mr. Moran for doing it.I'm off to Illinois again on Saturday to visit my ailing brother.  I'm hoping to find him in better spirits and in better health.

I can no longer be the \"responsible\" one on the trip -- seeing to everything because my mind doesn't work that way any longer.  He has always relied on me to do that -- and he isn't capable of doing it.  He might be capable of doing it, he just doesn't want to do it.  Plus, as I've mentioned before, he is very negative.  With him, the glass is never half full or half empty -- it's always empty.  there are always a million reasons why we can't do something, or he is worrying about things that are totally out of his control, which makes a trip more trying for me and way too stressful.

Young people these days don't understand that and if my son is reading this he is probably rolling his eyes. So, it was very refreshing to receive a beautiful hand written note from a young lady in California.  She had emailed me a few weeks back and she was working on a project for a class on Alzheimer's.  She asked if I would answer a few questions for her via email.  She was very sweet in understanding that I might not be able to answer all of them and to only answer the ones I felt comfortable with.  I did the best I could and this week I received a hand written note from her thanking me for my time.  She could have just as easily emailed me back with a thank you but she took the time out of her day to get a card, write a note and send it to me.  Thank you Kirsten -- that meant the world to me and I hope your project went well.I miss the letter writing.  I don't do very well with it these days so I hope that my cards speak for themselves.  I'm old fashioned that way I guess.Today my husband and I had lunch with a lovely couple. Both of these people had been my son's teachers in high school.  While my son was on the Academic Decathlon team he spent more time with them than he did with us, but considering they went to nationals each year and he learned so much we were so glad he got the opportunity.  And, what great role models they were for him. I couldn't think of two nicer people for my son to be around.  They will always mean a lot to me and to our son.In the last few days several people have asked me about my Alzheimer's and \"where I'm at with that\".  Some people don't want to ask because they really aren't sure how to either broach the subject or they are not sure that I want to talk about it.  But, I respect these people in their approach -- they have started by asking something like \"would it be inappropriate for me to ask about your Alzheimer's\".  That is so considerate and it is nice to know they are interested.  So many people act is if it is like a big elephant in the room and it is so much easier to talk about it than to have it hanging over your head.Our Memory Walk team raised the most money in the state......or at least we did until a company in Atlanta found out about it and matched it!

I was having an extremely hard time explaining things this week. I was trying to work on a few of my projects around the house and needed some help from my husband. Before I asked him I told him that it wasn't a good day for me and I it was going to be difficult for me to explain what I needed so he just needed to stay with me. He doesn't hear what I am saying most of the time and he caught the part that I needed help, but not the part about my having a hard time explaining what I needed. So of course, we got into a huge argument because he was mad that I couldn't explain exactly what I needed. I got upset, he was mad and it was just not good. I told him I would figure it out somehow -- I have yet to do that, but I can't go back to that scene again! It is just so frustrating to not be able to communicate efficiently. I wonder that as this disease progresses and it gets harder to actually convey anything, that will it be clear in my head and just not be able to get it out? Just not being able to communicate?Lots of little incidents like that happened this week. Then, I happened across something that I shouldn't have and it bothered me. It bothered me a lot and while I can't say what it was, it has played on my mind over and over and I can't reason it out. It's like I'm obsessed with it and can't really do anything with the information. I'm not sure I could explain it to anyone even if I could, but it disturbed me and that has been bothering me.So, I've tried not to ask for help when I don't absolutely need it. I'm frustrated, my husband gets frustrated and then we are at a standstill. I hate this.I've also had a difficult time doing things on the computer this week. I just couldn't get things right. Several people have been kind enough to forward things to me and I wasn't sure that I could get it all down properly so I have waited. Here are a few things that have been brought to my attention.NPR - National Public Radio -- This week a story aired from StoryCorps. To learn more about StoryCorps here is a linkhttp://storycorps.org/initiatives/mliIt was developed several years ago for people experiencing memory loss. It is a way for families to talk with their loved one, share stories of their past and to record a legacy of their life -- among other things. I have known several people that have taken advantage of this and it is a wonderful program. This week this story airedhttp://storycorps.org/listen/stories/robert-patterson-and-his-wife-karenAnother story that ran on NPR was about the early testing for Alzheimer's that has been in the news lately -- I have a related post to that in my blog. Also, USA Today is working on a big story on this subject and it will be out soon. The story from this week on NPR is at this linkhttp://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129454412And lastly, I received an email from a gentleman by the name of Norrms and he lives in England. He has younger on set Alzheimer's and he has a blog and has written a book. I will admit that I have only glanced over his site, so I can't say much about it at this point. I intend to spend some more time on it when I can concentrate a little better. But, his blog address ishttp://norrms.web.officelive.com/default.aspxI have had several other people contact me this week regarding books, DVD's etc. and I will try to sort through them soon.

        "content": "I've mentioned this before but it is so frustrating I could scream.  Twice this week I had a problem shopping and dealing with money.  Everyone knows that I can no longer make change -- and I usually give the clerk a $20 and I get my change back, or I use plastic.  I've been trusting of clerks to give me the correct change, because I couldn't tell you whether they were or they weren't!!!  Anyway, on Monday I went to get my hair trimmed and it was $12.00.  I gave the lady a $20.00 and she gave me $8.00 back.  I decided that I was going to check it -- stupid me.  I kept insisting that she gave me too much money back -- I thought she should have given me $7.00 back -- so I kept giving it back to her and telling her she gave me too much money back -- she was very patient with me and tried to explain several times, counting the money back to me several times.  I became frustrated and she was really patient.  Then I decided that if she insisted that I gave her too much, I must be wrong.  It was so confusing for me.Then today I went to the grocery and although I was using my debit card, I was using coupons.  I didn't think the clerk rang it up correctly with my coupons.  She went over it with me several times and I was holding up the line so I decided not to argue any more.  I'm sure she was right but I can not explain clearly enough what I am trying to say when it comes to the coupons and money off -- it is so simple, yet so hard.  I feel like such a fool.  I don't know why I try -- but sometimes I get that stubborn streak in me that \"I am going to figure this out one way or another\" -- i usually don't and become even more frustrated.

        "content": "I'm sure many of you have heard about the new article out about using spinal fluid to use as an indicator in diagnosing Alzheimer's. If not, here is a link to the Alzheimer's Assn. page that gives their take on it.http://www.alz.org/news_and_events_statement_regarding_biomarkers.asp.This was an interesting article to me, because eight years ago when I was going through my diagnosis, I actually had this procedure done and these exact things were looked at. My results showed that I had levels of tau and beta amyloid protein that were \"consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's\". A genetic test was also done at the same time and it came back that \"this individual possesses an ApoE genotype that indicates with high specificity that Alzheimer's disease is the cause of or a contributor to the observed dementia. We know that just because one carries this particular gene doesn't mean that you will develop Alzheimer's. Also, the absence of this gene does not rule out the diagnosis either.We will be hearing much more about this study I'm sure. I think my neurologist had these tests done on me because I was so young at the time of diagnosis and this was one more tool she could use. Although during my whole diagnosis the words \"Alzheimer's Disease\" rarely came up in conversation with the doctor, it was looming in the back of my head the whole time. And, although I was bracing myself for this diagnosis, to see the lab results come back with the actual words Alzheimer's, caught me off guard. I was actually seeing some data that said it might be likely. When I received the results of my neuro-psychological exam it said the same thing, I was still a little rattled. But all of that is behind me now and we move on.I just thought that these tests were the norm. But, I do recall talking to others with younger onset Alzheimer's and asking them if they had a spinal tap most of them said no. I guess we will see what happens with this new information.If we can just work as hard now to find a cure.Thanks to those that have made a donation to the Memory Walk in my behalf.

Last weekend, we went to a  professional tennis tournament in Atlanta.  It was 96 degrees and on the tennis court it was registering 140 degrees!  We weren't that far from the court, so you can just imagine how hot we were.  After 10 minutes in the stands, our clothes were soaked through.  When we left our seats and came back, you couldn't sit on them they were so hot.  Thank God they were wood, or we would have never been able to sit down.  Ralph poured some water on the wood to try to cool it down and it actually boiled!!   I know the tennis players are in a lot better shape and much younger than I but I don't know how they do it.  One player did have to get an IV of fluids after his match -- I'm thinking others must have as well.  The newspaper said that there were 39 people in the stands that had to have medical attention due to the heat and several were taken to the hospital over the course of the tournament.Yesterday, we played golf but we rented a cart and didn't walk.  It was still hot, but not bad when you are riding in a cart.I've had a couple of \"writing assignments\" if you will for things for the Alz. Assn. lately and they have been really tough for me.  Getting words out (even doing this blog) is getting harder and harder for me to do.  I know what I want to say, I just can't get my thoughs collected enough to put on paper.  It takes way too long to do it.  Thanks to Alan and Jennifer for being my editors on one piece --- it's so frustrating to me.   I think that is why I haven't been posting much, it is just too hard to get the thoughts out in an intelligent way......people already think you are stupid if you have Alzheimer's ......by reading my writing and it not making sense will add fuel to that fire!So, thanks for reading even I don't make sense some time.",

        "content": "to all of you that have sent emails to me lately, wondering about my whereabouts on this blog.  Sorry I haven't written -- I'm here.  Just having a problem getting my thoughts in order and typing them out.  I seem to have a problem lately with getting my thoughts organized and out whether they are in written or verbal form.  I went to the neurologist last week and he told me that he thought that I had gotten a little worse in my \"delayed speech pattern\". Which basically meant that I was having a hard time getting my words out.  I told him I thought so too, but then he looked at me and said, \"you know, there isn't anything I can do for you\". Which although I know that is true, it's hard to hear sometimes.It's frustrating for me when I can have whole conversations in my head that I want to have with someone, but I can't get the words out.My husband has been gone for about a week.  He's home today.  I know I have said it before, that when he is away and I am home alone, it is so much easier on me.  He knows this too so I'm not saying anything out of line.  I am amazed at how much easier it is -- not from the physical things I usually do like cleaning, cooking and dishes, but mentally.  I find that I can stay up longer at night because I'm not as mentally tired from having someone around all the time. And I get much more stressed when my husband is around, not sure what that is all about, but I would probably be stressed with anyone around --that isn't aimed at him!  My husband doesn't talk much, but he is a pacer -- he paces all over the house during the day. I'll be in one room trying to \"do my own thing\" and he will come in there many many times during his pacing.  Each time it interrupts what I am doing and although he says he doesn't want anything, it's still an interruption in my brain.  It's amazing how these little things will get to me.  And, of course, the noise is an issue -- which it gets worse and worse.  I think I might have had the television set on a total of about 5 or 6 hours during the entire time he was gone.  Counter that with the almost non-stop television set being on when he is home, it sure makes a difference.  He is getting better about wearing earphones with the televsion set, but it is still bothersome.  A friend of mine with AD, just had some custom made ear plugs made that he says blocks out all the noise except for conversations.  He says he can ride in the car with his wife with the radio on and not hear the radio but he can hear her when she talks.  I might look into that. We have finished converting my son's old bedroom into a \"quiet room\" for me and it has certainly been a great place for me to go to achieve some peach and quiet.On another note, my friend Carol and I went to Macon last week to an Alzheimer's fundraiser with the band Diamond Rio.  It was lots of fun to be away together and the concert was really nice.  Thanks Carol -- for being my chaueffer and most of all my friend for all these years -- Sainthood might be up there for you too! Carol will certainly understand this.",

In all we had 8 people from several congressional districts with us. Our goal was to go to Capitol Hill and ask our leigslatures for increased money for research, a coordinated plan to deal with Alzheimer's nationwide and a better way to improve detection, diagnosis and care planning. Rep. David Scott had already signed on for these things and when we returned we got word that Sen. Chambliss had signed on to the bill representing a coordinated plan to deal with Alzheimer's. We met with Representative John Lewis and he was the most gracious man to us. What a civil rights pioneer he has been and it was a pleasure to meet him. He is also very supportive of what the Alzheimer's Association is doing and gives us his complete support.I'll post some more photos next week -- I'm collecting them from other members that went with us. Thanks to Ginny and Kathy in the state office for setting up interviews and to the national office for putting this together.I have posted one photo on top though. This photo was taken from Rep. Lewis' office -- rather breathtaking isn't it? The reason I am posting it is that to the right (the round corner building) is the building my son works in. I was going to walk from the Capitol over to meet him for lunch and to meet the judge he works for. I've mentioned the fact before that I have a problem crossing the street -- there are too many visual signals that confuse me. But, I didn't really think much about it when going to see Alan. I walked about 10 minutes from the Capitol and got down to the intersection you see in the photo near that building and I didn't know what to do. I couldn't cross the street. There were a few people milling around but they weren't much help. I thought about calling Alan but he said that he would come down to meet me so I didn't have to go through security twice. So, I stood on the sidewalk and waited for him. He finally emerged from the office building and started walking across the street toward me so I walked toward him. I feel so stupid not being able to do this, but it's just one of those quirky things. I wouldn't have attempted to do that if I knew that he wasn't going to be on the other end. I travelled alone to Washington DC but Alan and Jennifer picked me up at the airport and got me to the hotel just fine.I got to meet many folks that I have been corresponding through email or through this blog at the conference. That is always great to be able to put a face to an email address.Diane -- you asked about a scholarship -- I did get a scholarship from national and our state office to attend.

What a refreshing friend to meet. I'm thankful for that. When you think about it, you don't really meet that many people that truly become friends -- usually just someone you meet in passing. It's a treasure to find a \"new friend\".We had a nice quiet Thanksgiving with son and daughter-in-law and her parents in Atlanta yesterday.

This book is a real \"hands on\" book in helping you to communicate with those that have the disease. Dr. Mary Cail is the author and she has certainly done her research on this book.After I was first diagnosed people didn't know how to talk to me. They thought (and some still do) that I couldn't think for myself, that I couldn't understand them and they would talk around me, not to me. They would (and some still do) say --\"You look great -- you don't have Alzheimer's\", or \"we all forget things every now and then I'm sure you're fine\". They say things like this because they don't know what else to say. Dr. Cail helps you out with this. She gives you avenues to go down with those with the disease -- in all stages of the disease, not just early on-set.Some of the stories in the book are sad, but you need to read them. It will help you understand the disease from the perspective of someone who has Alzheimer's.In terms of full disclosure, I must tell you that she has used some things from this blog in her book, but that isn't why you should buy it. She deals with the \"elephant in the room\" kinds of things that happen on a regular basis to us that have the disease. No one wants to broach the subject but she helps you through this. She shows that we don't have to be \"alone\" in our disease if our friends and family know how to deal with it. Most Alzheimer's patients and family will tell you that after the diagnosis, friends pull away. You don't get those invitations to go out, you don't get company very often. Dr. Cail tells you how to feel comfortable in those situations.Some of my friends point blank asked me after my diagnosis -- what should I say to you if I see you and you don't recognize me? I was grateful for the question, because they cared enough to want to know the answer. Today, sometimes I see people I know out shopping and they avoid me -- I don't know if they avoid me because they didn't see me or if they just don't know what to say. I know it's hard. but friends make the effort and this book helps.Dr. Cail's book can be found on Amazon athttp://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The+All-Weather+Friend%27s+Guide+to+Alzheimer%27s+Disease&x=0&y=0I can't do the book justice here, but if you get the book, you'll be glad you did.

We also spent some time with kangaroos, koalas, wmbats, dingoes, wallabys, and lots of birds yesterday.  The variety of birds is just amazing and they are all so colorful.The harbour is beautiful.  As I see things I keep thinking about my friends back home as to what they would like about the city.  Pody -- if you are reading this -- this is definitely a city for you and Rick -- with all the art, architecture and boats!!!The time change has taken a while to get used to.  I have sinced stopped asking everyone what day it is.I have certainly become a follower on this trip.  Alan has taken the lead and I am grateful for that.  I've had a couple of meltdowns with all the people and the noise, but we have managed that.  Sydney is a big city and I have to remember that it has lots of people and that bothers me.  But, we are adjusting. Getting my medicine adjusted from morning and night time pills has been interesting.   Alan isn't around me that much anymore so it is difficult for him to guess when things might be a problem for me.  But, I'm here and I'm enjoying myself.  He's taking care of me and that is good!  Jennifer is taking lots of photos and once I get some more time on the internet I will try to post some.The weather has been beautiful.  It is the beginning of spring here.  And, it is after the \"busy season\" so it is not as crowded (or so I am told) as it during the peak months.Our airline, Qantas, is threatening to strike next week and we have four flights left including our return trip home next week.  We are watching it carefully, but it would be a shame if we had to stay longer --- although Alan's new employer would not appreciate that much I'm sure.Lots of seafood here as you can imagine.  Sydney is heavily influenced by Asians.  We are heading to Melbourne today and we are told that in addition to an Asian flair there as well, it has the second largest Greek population outside of Greece, so that should be interesting.Thanks for reading -- more soon.",

I know part of the reason they are moving back here is because of my health, and I wish that weren't the case, but I am glad they are going to be \"home\" again.This afternoon I get to go speak to one of my favorite groups, a gerentology class at UGA. The professor invites me every year and I really enjoy talking with her students. They always have lots of questions. And, many times have a very different perspective on Alzheimer's. A chance meeting of this professor happened several years ago when I was on my way to an Alzheimer's meeting in Chicago and she was on the same shuttle bus from Athens to the Atlanta airport. I'm so glad I have gotten to know her. She also fields a team for our annual walk.And, I have a new book for you to consider. It's written by Dr. Mary Cail and it is called \"The All Weather Friend's Guide To Alzheimer's Disease\". I haven't personally read it yet, but it is available on Amazon. Here is a link to her websitehttp://www.allweatherfriend.com/. One of the lines on her website is \"Books to help friends be friends when it matters most\". I like that.

We've lived in Athens for 30 years and have followed the UGA Lady Bulldogs since moving here. Our head coach, Andy Landers, also starting coaching the team at the same time, so I like to consider Andy a friend of mine.When I was first diagnosed with early on set Alzheimer's, I sent an email out to all my friends. Within a matter of hours of sending that email out, Andy called and said he was coming to pick me up for lunch, to hear all about it and wanted to know what he could do to help. Those are the kinds of friends that we all need.So, I thought of that today, when I heard the news that Pat Summitt, head coach of the University of Tennessee Lady Vols was diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer's at the age of 59. Coach Summitt has been a big adversary of ours, but she is also to be admired for what she has done with her teams over the years. She made a video statement on the Lady Vols site today talking about the diagnosis and being very upfront about it. She sensed some relief in knowing what she had and now know what she is facing. I felt the same way -- I wanted to know what my problem was and then to deal with it. Coach Summitt has a lot of support, from her family, her fans and her UT family. She plans to continue coaching and I'm sure she will try to live as normal of a life as she can. I know she has great assistance and will get the support she needs from them and the University. I hope, that she, like myself, will have many more productive years ahead of her. She's tough, she's strong and she will make the best of her life.I have had lots of people reach out to me today -- wanting to know if I heard about Coach Summitt and what I thought. No one wishes this on anyone, but I wish her the best.Also, tonight, Glen Campbell was interviewed for the ABC News -- his full interview will be played tonight on Nightline. Mr. Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and is speaking out about it for the first time.In other news, people inquired as to how Alan did with the earthquake in DC. He said that his building which is right across from the Capitol was evacuated and then they were sent home. He walked home as the traffic was bad because everyone was trying to get home, and the metro system had slowed down. I told him he should have had a big one like this when he was living in California not Washington DC. Tonight he and Jen went down to take a look at the new Martin Luther King memorial. He said it was pretty impressive. Comedian Dick Gregory was there tonight -- he wasn't sure who he was as he is a little old for Alan to know him. But lots of people were taking his picture and he called to see if I knew who he was. I guess moms are good for something.",

Although -- I'm off again tomorrow to another Alzheimer's meeting in Atlanta.When we were at the golf tournament, I couldn't remember anyone's name. I saw the golfers and knew them, but then couldn't remember their name. On the practice days the golfers do not have people following them around with little signs with their names and scores on them. Their names usually only appear on their bags. And, if the caddies are carrying them the way they are suppose to (and they usually do) you don't see the name because the name part is always facing the ground. If the caddie stands the bag up on the green, you have to be lucky enough to have it facing you. Luckily enough for me there were enough people around that I usually overheard someone saying their name. I know I was tired when going but it was really bad.

Before my diagnosis, I used to say \"before I die I want to do _______\". Then sometimes I would get into my head that once I did that particular thing I was for sure going to die. So I started thinking of multiple things so I wouldn't exhaust my list. So, maybe that is why I don't write it down. However, since my diagnosis some of the things I had thought before I wanted to do, don't appeal to me as much. My priorities have certainly changed.I've read a couple of articles lately about improving your odds of being lucky. I'm not sure that is really a true statement as I thought lucky always meant by chance something fortunate happened to you. So strategically planning something isn't by chance. But several things that may have been on my bucket list at some point have happened because I was at the right place at the right time (like meeting certain people) -- that may be considered luck -- but when I think of it I had probably put myself in a certain spot in order for that to happen even though it wasn't a conscious decision on my part. I'm not sure I'm explaining this the best way I can -- but I think of a bucket list as something you concsiously set out to do and then achieve it.Some things I've always wanted to do or have:SkydiveGo to AustraliaWin a tennis tournamentShoot a hole in oneMeet Maria ShriverOwn a red Mazda MiataHave a screened in porchBe skinnyMake a difference to someoneSome of these I've achieved, some I haven't.What's on your bucket list?",

So, I'm up and thought I would write a few words.A few people I know are going through some \"transitions\" in life right now. Different circumstances for all of them, but transitions just the same. I got to thinking about how we perceive these times in our lives. Some take the bull by the horns and run with it, some fear change, some try to change their course and others just take what comes along. I think over the years I have tried all of these things. But, in the end, they weren't things I could control so the effort I put in didn't really matter because it was going to turn out the way it did for better or worse. It's funny how we envision things happening and then see the how they really happen.It's not what we thought it would look like at all. Kind of like thinking we knew the end to a good book and it didn't turn out to be anything like we thought is was going to be, but it was a good ending anyway. Or thinking that we found a missing piece of a puzzle only to find out it really wasn't the right one and the one we were looking for didn't seem to be the right fit the first time we looked at it. I know the people that are dealing with this right now will all make it through their respective transitions, but they might not believe they will. Things will work out and perhaps not in the way they envisioned them, but they are strong people and they will make it work in the end.

It was nice spending time with my son and daughter-in-law, but my main purpose there was to attend the Alzehimer's Association's Advocacy Forum. We spent one whole day on Capitol Hill talking to our legislators and their aides about the two bills I mentioned in my post below. Reaction was good and hopefully we will see some movement on these bills in the near future.I was also able to meet many folks who belong to a Facebook group called \"Memory People\". It was started several months ago and has almost 700 people in the group. Had I thought about it before, I would have planned to have a \"meet up\" with everyone, but as word spread that some of the group's members were there we were able to meet. At first the Facebook group started out with just those with Alzheimer's and has grown to include caregivers as well. It is a closed group and you need to be invited to be a part of it, but if you are interested in it, please leave me a message with your email address (I won't publish it) and I'll get back to you.My husband accompanied me to DC but didn't go to the meetings with me. He says it depresses him. I understand that -- it depresses me too, but I get through it. Having him with me was hard. Hard from the standpoint that I can only process so much information at a time. Usually when I go to these meetings, I'm able to go to my room at night and not have to talk to anyone, not have to listen to the television blaring and just have some down quiet time. When you are sharing a room, that is hard to do. I couldn't really relax or wind down before it was time to go to another meeting. I know I only absorbed about half of what was said because my brain was on overload, but I was there. I also worried about what my husband was doing, when and where to meet him, etc. Plus, as you know from my other posts, he worries about everything -- the weather, the cab fares, the restaurants, you name it he worries about it. And he doesn't just worry silently -- he has to share with me. I've lived with it for over 30 years -- i should be used to it right? Again.....slow learner!I encourage you to hop on over the website for the Alzheimer's Association and check out what happened at the Advocacy Forum. And, if you aren't already an advocate -- I hope you would consider doing it. It doesn't take much time, and we need you.Another site I would encourage you to go to ishttp://www.alzimpact.org/. Alzheimer's Impact movement (AIM) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit advocacy organization working in strategic partnership with the Alzheimer’s Association to make Alzheimer's disease a national priority. There's lots of great information on the site about current legislation and issues that are vital in moving our cause forward \"A World Without Alzheimer's\"",

        "content": "is a book written by Marianne Talbot. The book deals with caring for someone with dementia. Ms. Talbot tells the stories of caring for her mother in a truly unique, humorous and loving way. For all of my readers out there who care for someone with dementia, it's worth reading. You're not alone although I know you feel it sometimes. Believe me, the person with dementia does as well. Ms. Talbot's book starts out with the definition of \"piglet\" which she uses throughout her book. She borrowed it from another writer, but the word \"piglet\" is used throughout the book to stand for the person being cared for. It stands for \"PersonIGiveLove andEndlessTherapy to\". It took me a little while to get used to this word in the book, but before long I caught on -- yes, I'm a little slow to new ideas.The book deals with all phases of dementia as well as most phases of care-giving....from in home care to nursing home care. The author has friendly tips all throughout the book in dealing with her \"piglet\" to dealing with other family members. In the back of the book she offers practical advice on dealing with the stages of dementia.But it is humorous and warm and filled with compassion. If you are a caregiver, please look for this book. You'll see yourself in it, you'll have dealt with the same problems, and you'll feel like part of a community.One word of note -- the book was written in England and many of the references deal with British agencies, laws and legal issues inherent to the British ways. You will probably find something comparable in the country you live in, but there are lots of British references.Thanks to Ms. Talbot for having the courage to write such intimate details about her life and her relationship with her Mum. Knowing I am on the other side of the coin made me feel bad, knowing what my family has to look forward to. I'm not sure I could be a good caregiver if I had to be, but you never know I guess until you are facing it. God bless all the caregivers out there -- you are heroes in my book!",

I'm at an advocates forum and this year over 600 people are here. Over 300 of these people are here for the first time -- that says a lot! We are here to help get the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act passed as well as the HOPE act which insures a care plan for those with an Azlheimer's diagnosis.Yesterday, Melody Barnes spoke to our group at lunch. She is the Director of Domestic Policy for President Obama. Imagine my surprise when in the middle of her speech she mentioned my name! She then began to quote from an article I had written for The Shriver Report. I was shocked when I heard my name mentioned by her. My cell phone started buzzing with text messages from others in the room commenting about my mention. It was a little embarassing but I was humbled at the same time. I guess the administration is looking at lots of sources out there on Alzheimer's. I've also met some folks from the Facebook Page Memory people. Many of them are here for the first time and are enjoying their experiences.Have also had a chance to spend time with my son and daughter-in-law while in DC. More when I return.",

I didn't want to just post this in comments, as many of my readers don't always read them. So, I hope you don't mind. And, speaking from someone that has Alzheimer's -- I know that this certainly meant a great deal to your mom. We should all wish for such a \"touching moment\" in our lives.I came across your blog and thought I'd tell you the story behind that \"touching moment\". The couple you saw dancing was my mom and my cousin (he's more like her grandson than nephew as his father is my father's baby brother). \"Look At Us\" was my parents song from the day they heard it until last year when Daddy was snatched away from us following a tragic accident. Mom has Alzheimers and Daddy was taking care of her. She now lives with me, my husband and daughter. On April 29, 2003, 3 days before my parents' 50th anniversary, my niece had gotten front row seats for my parents and aunt and uncle (parents of the young man you saw dancing) to go and see Vince in Sarasota, Florida. We had made them a sign and my aunt gave a letter to a security guard before the concert asking that Vince sing \"Look At Us\" for my parents. Not only did he sing it for them but he brought them up on stage and they danced on stage while he sang. It was a moment that is one of my mom's most treasured memories and one that Alzheimer's hasn't touched. Before Daddy died he promised Mom he'd take her to see Vince one more time. When my cousin heard on the radio that Vince was coming to Macon and it was an Alzheimers fundraiser he called to let us know and I bought tickets the day they went on sale. We knew this was orchestrated by God as it was 3 days after Daddy's birthday and Mom and Dad's anniversary and with Mom having Alzheimers we knew how special this opportunity was. Both of Daddy's sister's, his only living brother and his wife, their son,and my husband and I were there with Mom. We didn't tell her where we were going and she was so surprised and excited when she picked up the program from her chair. My aunt and I had written Vince letters and I gave them to the guitar player when he was tuning he guitar before the concert. If you remember Vince dedicated the song in memory of Dennis Segars - my dad. So now you know...... the rest of the story. Vince Gill is an amazing person that has given my mom and my family 2 of the most precious memories and I will forever be grateful to him for taking the time to read a letter and then having the compassion to touch the lives of people he's never met in such a special way!!",

I noticed a young man (late 20'as I would say) get up and an older lady followed him. I guess she was in her early 80's maybe? Anyway, the young man, took the lady in his arms and started dancing with her. I'm sure it was his grandmother or something, but it was so touching. It brought a tear to my eye. Several people got up to take their photo and when Vince Gill finished his song there were lots of women around that young man clapping for him and his partner. I shed a tear at that, too.

        "content": "Last night I caught a few minutes of Hallmark Hall of Fame movie, Beyond the Blackboard. And, while I didn't catch all of the movie, I caught many of the commercials. My mom used to say that I would always watch the commercials and leave when the shows were on, so I guess I come by that honestly. And, I worked for an advertising agency for many years, so yes, I'm into those commercials. One thing about the commercials last night was that Hallmark showed a current commercial and then a commercial from twenty or thirty years ago. The fact that I actually remember some of the old commercials was amazing.One of the commercials depicted a woman looking into an old box with cards that her children had given her over the years. This tugged at my heart strings for a bit, because, what mother doesn't do that? Don't we all save things our children have made or given us at one time or another? I know we can't keep everything, but I'll bet that most moms that are reading this also have a little treasure box tucked away where they can go and get some of those special treaures from their children (or other loved ones). I know I do. Quite often I find myself going back to \"my box\" because I don't know when I am going to forget those things. I think,too, that your children don't realize how much those things mean to you until they themselves become parents. I think about the elctronic age (yes I realize I am writing this in the electronic age) we live in and how in the not too distant future cards (like books and newspapers) will become a thing of the past. It's not the same printing out an email as to when someone takes the time to sign a card or write a note. I know I have written about this before, but the Hallmark commercial last night had me thinking about it all day today.Please think twice when the next holiday or event comes up and you quickly type that email to a special person. Think how much more it would mean to them to have a hand written note they can cherish. I hope that never goes away.And, speaking of special things, my two \"surrogate sons\" that I have talked about so much on my blog, have both found out that their wives are expecting babies and within two weeks of each other.

I had some coupons and there were some specials going on at the office supply store I was at. When I was looking at what I wanted to buy, I couldn't figure out what the best deal was. Should I buy more than one with my coupon? some items were buy one get one free, was that a better deal than what I went in there for? Too many choices and too many variables for my mind to wrap around . Since I was looking at an item with a relatively high ticket price I didn't want to make a mistake. The sales people kept asking me if they could help me and I was so confused by everything I couldn't even explain what I needed to tell them or ask them. I know I stood there for a very long time trying to figure it out. I know that it was probably something very simple, but I just got so frustrated I left the store. Why do I keep putting myself in these situations? Because I want to be able to do it and I used to be able to do it.

Maybe I will have to resort to that. My knee is healing. That's a good thing. Most of you that know me, know that I am not a real patient person and of course I want to be all better, right now. But, that ain't happening. But I have started walking around the house without my cane, am doing physical therapy three times a week. I started driving this week -- o.k. only to therapy but it is a start. I still have a difficult time sleeping but hopefully that will get better as well. It's coming along....just slowly. A dear friend dropped by this morning with dinner for us. She is someone I have known for close to twenty years. Our paths first crossed when she was working for the local newspaper and she covered some of the work I was doing special events for Downtown Athens. We kind of drifted apart as our jobs and lives took some twists and turns. But we've picked up right where we left off several years ago when we both made an effort to get together. You know how it is -- one will say \"we need to do lunch\" or \"we need to go have coffee\" and then you never do. Well, we finally did and I'm so thankful for that. Thanks for being a great friend Meg -- I love you! Mentally, I haven't been feeling real good. I think basically because of the limitations my knee has given me. Hate being housebound and feeling useless. Plus, it has been raining for about the last 5 days and it has just been dreary. But, I probably turned somewhat of a corner this week. I am finally able to wear \"regular clothes\" -- mainly meaning my jeans/slacks/pants. I couldn't before because my knee was so swollen I couldn't get the pants on over my knee. So, I have been living in sweat pants or shorts and it has been a little too cool for shorts. Getting dressed in real clothes has helped me mood a little. And, since I have started strenuous therapy I at least am able to ride the stationary bike to get my blood pumping! This also helps with my mental attitude as well as helps me think clearer. I realized some time ago that there is definitely a connection between exercising and brain function -- or at least there is for me. I definitely do better dealing with my Alzheimer's when I am exercising on a regular basis. Remember, whatever is good for your body is good for your brain! Here's to getting better faster!!!!",

Except......the little problem I have about crossing streets by myself.  I know, it sounds silly and stupid. But, if you think about it, we don't cross the street by foot much anymore.  We pull up to the grocery, or the bank or wherever we are going and then walk into the business.  Or at least, that is the way I usually do it.  I don't find myself having to walk too far on the streets in Athens.  So, I ventured out into the streets of downtown Nashville and came to my first cross walk. I panicked. I forgot that this is a problem for me......mainly because I don't usually do this and normally I have someone with me.  The problem is that there are too many conflicting signals for my brain to decipher.  Thwe blinking cross walk sign, the traffic signals and traffic noise don't move smoothly through my brain.  They collide into a huge mass of confusion for me. I don't trust the other people walking (because I don't know them) and that people walk when they are not suppose to.  I didn't want to turn back the block or so that I had walked from the hotel so I thought I would venture on and see what I could do by myself. Sometimes, I am just determined to do it come hell or high water!  I stood at the corner for a good while before deciding to move.  I only went across the street when there wereabsolutelyno cars coming.  This, by the way, was after the lights had cycled maybe three times. I'm sure if there was someone watching me they were thinking this lady is a lunatic.Down the next block I saw an officer and thought I could ask for his assistance at the next block -- which I did.  All the while thinking, what happens if this police officer is not here when I come back?  I always try to think of a contingency plan -- and it is so odd that I can usually come up with something to work (for now anyway) but I can't figure out how to get across the street!  Anyway, this officer was very friendly.  I explained my situation to him and he told me that in the direction I was going there were police officers on every corner because of the high volume of people in town --- thank you Nashville!  I ran into one officer that was on asegue wayand he helped me for several blocks.  After walking around for an hour or so, I made my way back to the hotel with help from mainly the men in blue.

So, I appreciate all those that still read this blog, because a lot of times I do just ramble......without structure.....random thoughts that pop into my head -- have to write them quickly or they pop out just as fast. Having said all of this, I want to share an experience I had yesterday and you may have to weave it all together, but it means a lot to me.Yesterday was one of those days where it was cold and rainy. A day where you wanted to stay inside and read a book or take a nap. But, I had plans to go out and meet some old friends for lunch. I met these ladies thirty years ago. That's shortly after we moved to the south. My husband had been transferred and when he transferred many of the same people he worked with up north transferred along with him. So when he went to work here, it was kind of like working where we used to live, because although he was in a different building, he was doing the same thing and working with the same people.I, on the other hand, was the new wife, moving to a small town, had no job and knew no one. So, we joined a small community country club -- and when you think of country club, I'm sure you are not thinking of this one -- no white table cloths, no exclusive parties, no high initiation fees, no valet parking, no waiting list to join. It was an affordable one for what we wanted to do --which was mainly play tennis. There was a golf course and a swimming pool, but our main focus at the time was to play tennis. We paid our modest amount of money to join and bought basically the \"tennis package\" which allowed us to make reservations for a court and play about as much tennis as we wanted.We slowly began to meet other people that played tennis and before I knew it I was on a tennis team. Then, I was on two tennis teams. Then I was playing in some socials....and you get the drift. The ladies that I played with became my newest best friends. It was my \"community\" at the time. I didn't realize what an important part of my life these people would become. We seemed to live at the tennis courts and traveled together for matches. As we each had children, we started bringing them to the courts where the bigger ones would watch the smaller ones. We came from different backgrounds, different counties and different cultures. But we were all a family on the tennis court -- even though we liked some strong but friendly competition.Over the years, one by one we stopped playing tennis, or we stopped playing in league play. We all had our reasons, whether it be family, injuries, returning to work or whatever. But, those 25-30 people that became my community back then, still surface from time to time and we picked up where we left off.That's a long way of saying, that yesterday, I met two of these ladies for lunch. One I had not seen in probably twenty years, the other, I have just recently gotten back in touch with and renewed that friendship. It was great catching up with both of them and I realized how lucky I was (or am) to have these women in my life. It didn't seem like we missed a beat in picking up our conversation -- like we were talking over the tennis net. Although we have lost touch over the years, they (and all my tennis buddies) are people I know that I could pick up the phone and ask for help if I needed it. We all need friends like that. I hope they consider me to be just as an important friend to them.  I thank them for being in my life.I can remember times my son and I would be out shopping and I would run into one of my tennis friends and introduce Alan. Many times he would turn to me and say \"Mom, is there anyone you haven't played tennis with?\" It always made me smile. I would reply \"Of course, there is -- but this lady was a friend of mine, too\". They were all friends and \"my family\" as well.We all have our own little communities and they change the way we look at things. Sometimes we forget that our friends help shape who we are. I'm glad I have the friends I have....even if I don't see them as often as I should.",

I did an interview with a young student yesterday from UGA for a journalism class that she was doing.  I did awful -- I didn't even make sense most of the time.  I guess it will give her a chance to use her editing skills.  I knew exactly what I wanted to say, but couldn't get it to come out the way I wanted it to.Since I last wrote, Ralph was in St. Louis for almost a week for a family funeral. It was nice to have the house to myself.  Alan and Jennifer visited Jen's sister Christine in Chicago over the MLK weekend, and they also got to visit with my friends the Atterberrys. I went to Alabama for a women's basketball game and am going to South Carolina this week for another women's game.Thanks to all that have commented lately -- it's interesting to see what people have on their minds.

        "content": "is a new book out by Lisa Genova.  Lisa is my friend that wrote the best seller Still Alice about a young woman with Younger On Set Alzheimer's.  Lisa's new book is about a woman who has a condition called \"Left Neglect\".  It is where a person with this, does not recognize his/her left side.  Lisa first told me about this condition a year or so ago when she was working on the book before Still Alice even came out.  I was intrigued with it and looked up what I could on-line.  It's a very interesting brain disease. I'm sure this book will bring loads of attention to Left Neglected.As I said with Still Alice, run to the bookstore to get this book, don't walk.  I was mesmerized by it and it is an easy read -- even for someone with Alzheimer's.   And, while I don't suffer from left Neglected, it is a brain disease just as Alzheimer's is.  And, like I could relate to Alice in Still Alice, I can relate to the character in Left Neglected, Sarah.In the book, Sarah has a car accident and ends up with a brain injury - Left Neglected.At one point in the book she is working on her physical therapy and her son is by her side.  Her son has Attention Deficit Disorder and while he is working on his homework, he declares himself stupid because he can't get his homework right.  Sarah asks him if he thinks she is stupid because she can't do some things right.  He tells her no.  Then Sarah says, \"Right. Neither of us is stupid. Our brains work in a different way than most people's do, and we have to figure out how to make ours work.  But we're not stupid, okay?\"  How this hit home......I feel stupid a lot of times because I can't do some simple things.  It's easy to say your stupid, even though you're not. I guess it is the easy way out, but I fight this on a daily basis.In another instance Sarah remarks on all the changes that have been thrust upon her in the last few months....getting used to it and redefining \"normal\".  I feel like I redefine the meaning of normal everyday!In another instance Sarah talks about being helpless. She is crying to her mother that she doesn't want to be helpless. Her crying intensifies as she says the word helpless.  Her mother tells her she is not helpless, she just needs some help. They are not the same.\"  I had to really stop and take a deep breath over this one.  While I am not helpless (now) I know I need help and it is hard to ask for help.  But there is a difference and I need to recognize that and keep moving forward.Thanks, Lisa, for writing this book. You have another winner on your hands.",

        "content": "Something I like most about the holidays is hearing from everyone through Christmas Cards. I know a lot of people have stopped sending cards in favor of electronic greetings. But I love seeing the photo cards that come in the mail and can't believe seeing everyone's children or grandchildren growing up so fast. And, I like hearing about what everyone has done the past year. Staying connected with people is important to me. And, I appreciate the cards I get each year --that people are still willing to keep in touch with me. Then, out of the blue, I'll get a phone call from someone I haven't heard from in a very long time. That happened again yesterday, when Patty Smith called me from Falls Church Virginia. Patty was on the Alzheimer's Association Early Stage Advisory group several years ago. Patty and her husband were also the driving force behind the Alzheimer's Association getting a multi million dollar grant from the American Express company for the Alz. Association. How nice it was to talk to Patty and hear her voice. That meant a lot to me. I also heard from other former advisory members over the holidays that I haven't heard from in awhile.The holidays were a little more trying for me this year. I think a lot played into it, but I must do a better job of pacing myself, as well as not trying to get so overwhelmed. The latter is a little harder to do because you never know when one of those simple projects you start, are going to turn into something different -- thus the result is not so good. But, I guess I need to relish in the fact that I cans till do so much -- although not happy with the outcome much of the time.My son and daughter-in-law were here over the holidays. I'm sure you have figured out that is them above. It was nice to have them home. I really appreciate the effort they take to get here -- with traveling during the holidays. Luckily the snow we got in Georgia and the snow up the east coast didn't get them stranded anywhere with the times they were flying.The new year brings on lots of new challenges for me. I think I need to look at them more as opportunities to keep me going.Thanks to the UGA Pyschology class I spoke to for the lovely note they sent to me after speaking to their group. One of my followers asked what type of questions they asked. Some wanted to know if I still drove, how did I deal with the fact that I could no longer do things I once did everyday. I shared with them how I had a difficult time crossing the streets in large cities because of all the signals flashing at once and this was a little hard for them to understand. And, when I told them how difficult it was for me to talk on the phone and that I relied heavily on email and they asked if I was able to utilitze all the new technology with smart phones, texting and the like. I told them that I had a hard time learning new things and had a difficult time with all the new \"lingo or abbreviations\" they used now! Although, my old phone does not have a regular keyboard -- I'm still relying on the phone key pad and that takes me forever to text a message to someone. It's interesting to hear the questions that the students ask. The older students have a different perspective on things. Most everyone in the classes I speak to though have known or do know someone with Alzheimer's so they can relate in some way to what I am saying. I think the most awkward question was when someone asked me how Alzheimer's affected my sex life!Happy New Year to all!",

        "content": "I wouldn't say that I \"love\" Christmas like lots of people do.  I usually get a little down during the holiday season and don't really know why.  I guess I don't like the expectation of everyone thinking you should be happy for the holiday season when in fact you should try to be happy all the time!But what I do like about the holidays is the receiving of holiday cards.  If you know me, you know I like to receive cards, make cards and send cards.  So many people don't send holiday cards anymore and that is a shame to me.  But those that do, I love getting them, and I say thank you.  Even if there isn't a holiday letter inside explaining to me what everyone has been up to I still enjoy them.  I thank the Lord I have friends that still remember me and take the time to send that holiday greeting.  And, I love reading all the letters -- I know a lot of people make fun of them, but I do enjoy reading about all the wonderful things people are doing and the love they are sharing.Our family didn't have a lot of \"traditions\" at the holiday time when I grew up except maybe two that I remember.  My father was a pressman for the Peoria Journal Star (PJS), the daily newspaper in Peoria Illinois where I grew up.  He always worked nights.  But Christmas Day was the only day of the year, the PJS didn't publish.  So, my dad would always have Christmas Eve off from work.  We knew he would always be home that night.  In fact, my mother and father were married on Christmas Eve because of that very fact.  At the time, he was an apprentice and didn't get much time off at all, so they knew they were safe in planning a Christmas Eve wedding and that his friends from the newspaper could be at the wedding. Every year on Christmas Eve, it seemed as if everyone we knew came by the house and \"celebrated\" my parent's anniversary and Christmas Eve.  I don't know how it started, but every year, we could always count on seeing our friends, neighbors and relatives that one time of the year.  No one was sent invitations, everyone just showed up.  My mom always had lots of food and everyone brought their homemade goodies to share with everyone.  I don't remember my mom working for days getting things prepared......it just happened.  I'm sure she did, but don't they say that the sign of a good party is when it looks effortless?Another tradition that we had involved my dad.  He was an orphan growing up.  His mother had some problems in child birth after one of his siblings was born and could no longer care for my dad and his siblings.  They were put in an orphanage and all of the children were adopted out to different families except one who ended up staying in the orphanage until she was a young adult.  The family that adopted my family didn't end up raising him as he ran away and headed up to Illinois (he was born in the south). In adulthood, he ended up finding a sister and a brother and was able to actually reunite with his birth mother before she died.  But, having grown up an orphan he didn't exactly have many traditional Christmases.  He never asked for a lot, but he loved opening presents.  So, we would wrap everything and anything for my dad to unwrap on Christmas day.  He was a big fisherman so we would end up wrapping individual little hooks and fishing flys just so he would have a lot to open up.  It sounds silly, but he enjoyed opening all the presents as much as we enjoyed seeing him smile.My dad died the year before my son was born.  One of my biggest regrets in life is not having Alan sooner so my dad could have met him. They would have been buddies.Life's short.  Make your own traditions with your family and cherish the moments you have together.  The tragedy that unfolded recently in Connecticut should bring that home to everyone.",

Through him, I got to know Lisa.  In February of 2010 I met Lisa for the first time in Savannah.  She had just finished Left Neglected and was starting to work on Love Anthony.  She told me that Love Athony was about autism.  She was explaining to me how she was handling the subject and I couldn't quite get into my head how it was going to work.  A few weeks ago, Love Anthony came out.  I bought it but didn't pick it up until this weekend.  When I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.Without ruining the story or the ending for you, I wanted to say that Lisa has nailed this just like in her other two books.  The story involves two women whose lives are paralleled throughout the book, with them coming together at the end. One woman writes a book about autism, the other woman has a son that has autism.  When they meet, the woman who has the son tells the other woman that she has written the story of her son's life.  This was such a poignant moment for me, because when I read Still Alice, I said out loud to no one, \"this is the story of my life\".  I couldn't believe that she had captured this so eloquently and so on target.  So, when I read this in this book I thought it was very ironic for me.And, Lisa also gives a shout out to Athens, GA -- which certainly brought a smile to my face.I know I wrote about Left Neglected when it came out as well.  It's about a neurological condition called Left Neglect.  I had never heard of it and it just fascinated me when I read the book.If you want a good read, please go get Love, Anthony.  You will not be disappointed -- oh, and bring some tissues because you are going to need them.",

        "content": "For about the last year, I have been thinking about going fishing.  That probably sounds funny to most of you.  But, when I was young, my father pretty much fished every day of his life.  He would work the night shift as a pressman for the daily newspaper, come home, eat breakfast, go fishing and then take a nap.  He'd get up from his nap, eat dinner and go to work.  I loved going fishing with my dad because it was about the only time I saw him and it was alone time with him.  We would always get in an argument because my dad would be trolling the boat and if he caught a fish while trolling we would stop, put down anchor and fish there for awhile.  If I caught a fish while trolling he wouldn't stop but go somewhere else to fish.  We used to laugh about this all the time.My dad died about 29 years ago.  My big regret has always been that I had not had my son when my father died.  My dad would have loved Alan.  I see a lot of my dad in Alan and that makes me proud. I miss my dad.  My mom and I weren't that close and I guess dads and daughters are.  After my dad died I took one of his fishing rods and have it mounted in my living room.  It's a constant reminder of that constant person in my life.  I haven't been fishing in over 30 years and the more I think about my dad the more I want to go fishing.My brother visited about a month ago and he made the comment he wanted to go fishing.  I was so surprised he said that because I hadn't told him what I was thinking, and he wasn't the first one to volunteer to go fishing with dad.  He would go on occasion, but he certainly wasn't the first one in the boat.  And, I don't remember him cleaning fish with dad and I.  He probably did, but I don't remember that.  So, we had this conversation while he was here about fishing and I needed to buy a rod and reel because one way or another this summer I am going fishing.  I've said a few things to friends about wanting to go fishing and although they fish on a regular basis I haven't been given an invitation to go with them -- so I'll do it on my own.  And, maybe I'll even catch enough for my dinner.",

        "content": "This post is going to be long and it is going to jump around a lot, so hang in there with me. I've been making notes about some of the things I wanted to write about and the topics are all over the place. I can't come up with a way to string them all together, so I'll try to at least group my thoughts. This is one of those instances where I can't get everything to flow smoothly in my brain, so I'm doing the best I can today. Most of the time I just put it off because I can't get it to come out like I want -- but this time I'm going for it!I've been to two funerals in the past three weeks. Both lives cut way too short. The services were unique in their own way. But both services brought home to me that there is never enough time to be with your family and friends. One minister said \"Death ends a life, not a relationship\". But when I think of Alzheimer's I think just the opposite -- Alzheimer's ends a relationship, not a life. As the disease progresses it is harder and harder to have a \"normal\" relationship with those you love. It's constantly changing and much sooner than you would like -- the relationship becomes one sided with those afflicted inching away. I guess that is why I've always said \"I have the easy part\".The last funeral I attened was for a friend that had a terminal illness and knew she was dying. She had given her pastor instructions on what she wanted her memorial service to be like -- the hymns to be sung, the prayers to be said. As I was sitting there I couldn't help but think of my own family. We've talked about what we want to happen to us when we die but never about any type of service. After this particular service I was laughing with some friends about the fact that when I die no one will probably know. They asked me why and I told them that these days it costs money to put an obituary in the paper and anyone who knows my husband knows that he would never spend money like that! So, I've told them if they don't hear from me one way or another for a month or so they might want to check! In all seriousness, I'm going to give it some thought and try to steer my family in the right direction anyway. We've given a lot of other things thought. We've gotten all of our legal \"stuff\" worked out. And, as bad as this may sound to you, I've even selected photos and items I would like to have in my room if and when the time comes to place me in a home. I have to believe that if some things are important to me now that they will be then. Although I won't be able to communicate it.Friends -- I've talked a lot about firends and alzheimr's. How it was difficult for some of my friends after I was first diagnosed. Many just walked away. Some have retured and others have not. That's o.k. I'm meeting new friends and at this stage of my life I'm kind of surprised by that. You usully think of friends as being those life long friends from elementary, high school or college. But since I've been out of school for so long and live far away from my home town, I suppose its only right that my friends are somewhat local and easy to find time to visit with. My new friends intrigue me because some are much younger and some I have met by happenstance.It saddens me that several of my friendships I thought were pretty solid have gone by the wayside. I've tried to reach out to them on numerous occasions with no response. I would really like to know what happeneed. If I did something wrong I want to apologize even if the friendship is beyond repair. I want to know because I don't want to make the same mistake with others. It's o.k. if they don't want to be friends any longer -- I'd just like to know why. The thing that probably gets to me the most is I didn't see it coming. Sometimes you do. Sometimes you just drift apart. I didn't realize there was a problem with these friends. I hope some day I'll know and I hope in some way some of these people will work themselves back into my life -- before I can't remember them.Major meltdown -- A few weeks ago I was out at our local Target store. I hadn't been in there for awhile and it looked as if they were in the middle of a makeover. At first it didn't bother me, but after about fifteen minutes in the store and a cart half full -- I started to panic. I didn't know where things were, everything looked different and I just got disoriented. I literally froze in place. I knew I needed some help. My husband was out playing tennis so I couldn't call him. I checked my phone for my one number dialing and everyone on there didn't live in Athens (I have since changed my dialing numbers). Finally someone who knew me walked by and realized I was having some problems. I just needed to get out of the building and she helped me. I haven't been back since. After telling this story to several people they all asked me the same thing. When you are traveling and go into a store that is unfamiliar to you how does that affect you? My answer probably doesn't make a lot of sense to them -- but usually I am with someone and I'm not expecting merchandise to be in a certain place or on a certain shelf. The things that catch me off guard seems to be a trigger point for me.Money -- You would think by now I would just stop trying to make change. But every now and then I try to test myself on it -- it's simple right? A few days ago I was buying something and it came to a total of $26.10. It took me awhile to get the $26 counted out. I was so proud of myself. Then came the $.10. Although I could hear the clerk tell me I was ten cents short, I couldn't physically take the dime out of my wallet. I knew what I was suppose to do -- but the whole process couldn't make it from my brain to my fingers. This is just so frustrating -- I need to just stop testing myself. By the way -- I asked the clerk if he minded just taking the dime out of my wallet. Yes, he looked at me pretty strange and he did it....but hey....welcome to my world.",

Many people are intimidated to go to the \"gold dome\" as we often call our capitol. They are intimidated by not knowing the process of talking to our legislators and afraid of saying the wrong thing. The great day about the Awareness Day at the Capitol is that if you feel uncomfortable talking, you don't have to -- you just need to be there. There will be others willing to talk on your behalf, but you showing up and adding to our numbers makes a difference. When legislators see the \"sea of purple\" (since you'll be given purple shirts to wear\" it makes a big impact on them. We want to make legislators aware that Alzheimer's isn't going to go away any time soon, and we need their help.The Georgia Alzheimer's office is currently working on several initiatives that we want our legistlators to know about. Items that will affect not only those living with the disease but certainly the hundreds of caregivers in Georgia. One of those things is a state Alzheimer's Plan. Currently, 19 states have state Alzheimer's plans. These plans help to guide how Alzheimer's is handled on a state basis and will work in conjunction with the National Alzheimer's Project Act that is currently being formed on a national level. The state plan can deal with all types of issues facing those dealing with Alzheimer's to help with respite care, programs and services and laws that protect our loved ones with Alzheimer's.Many initiatives need funding -- and although we know funding is in short supply these days, if we don't stay out in front of our legislators, then we will be forgotten.If you've never done anything like this before, please consider joining us. As a favor to me, and the other 200,000 people living with Alzheimer's in the state of Georgia. Numbers count. And we need you to help make a difference. Just your presence is something. Don't be intimidated -- you won't have to do anything you aren't comfortable with. But, if you are reading this blog, you probably have someone in your life you know with Alzheimer's and you can help us just by showing up on Feburary 13th.The day will start with lunch, then a walk to the capitol to meet with legislators and possibly the governor and end with dinner and a candlelight tribute on the steps of the capitol. You can come for all or part of it. I can't stress enough what an impact seeing hundreds of people wearing purple shirts in the capitol makes.You must register -- but it is simple and can be done online. There is also training if you so desire to learn about the iniatives that are going to be discussed. You can do that in person or online if you so choose. We just need to know if you are coming or not so we can plan for food and shirts for everyone. You can read more about here:http://act.alz.org/site/PageNavigator/georgiaadvocacy.html1Please make Alzheimer's a priority -- we need everyone's help!",

I would wake up in the middle of the night with the best ideas, plan it all out in my head and by morning, it was gone. I'm sure you're saying, why didn't you get up and write it down. I've tried that before, and when I do, I can't go back to sleep. So, I am giving up ideas for sleep is what it sounds like! Since my sleep is often given up to hot flashes (or \"power surges\" as one friend calls it) I don't like to give up much more!I was overwhelmed with our trip to Australia, and quite frankly it took a lot to get back to normal after that trip. It pretty much took the wind out of my sails if you will. But, it was worth every minute -- it just came at a bad time of the year, but it was the only time we could go and did I mention IT WAS WORTH IT?I don't usually do the traditional resolution thing at the new year. Why should you have to wait for a new year to make a change? If you need to make a change, you need to make a change. I'm not sure I'm up to \"changing\" things this year, that probably isn't within my power -- or at least the things I would like to change are not. But, I need to be better about some things. ....but don't we all.I want to be a better friend. I don't want to keep saying \"we shouldn't wait so long to get together\" -- I just need to make it happen. A few of my friends have kind of gone by the wayside this past year. That saddens me some. I wonder why that is. Do our friendships run in cycles? Do we just not work hard enough at it? Is it maybe the friendship wasn't meant to be? Has the friendship run its course? Am I to blame? I get the feeling people don't want to be around me as much anymore. That's kind of hard to come to terms with but what bothers me more is not knowing. If those that choose not to be friends any longer would just admit it or bring it to a close, rather than leaving that faint hint of welcome in their voice it would be so much better. I know that is hard to do, but I'd rather just know why it is the friendship has ended. We have invested a lot of time over the years and to just let something go without paying attention to it is sad. I don't know what else to say about that.Another thing I want to work on is to be better to myself. I need to pace myself better. I need to let things go more easily. It's hard to admit you can't do something that you could do all your life -- I just need to let go! I'd like to do more public speaking on behalf of Azlheimer's so if there is a group you think I could talk to -- let me know.I'm grateful for a lot last year. My family's health has stayed about the same (not gotten worse thankfully), there have been many new babies born to bring a smile to my face, my son and daughter-in-law have moved \"back home\", I got a new knee and lots of help from friends when I was going through that ordeal. I read Dr. Mary Cail's book, The All-Weather Friend’s Guide to Alzheimer’s Disease and everyone dealing with someone with Alzheimer's should read it. I've stayed active on Alzheimer's Association's boards. Our Walk to End Alzheimer's reached its targeted goal of $75,000 raised. And, of course, the aforementioned \"trip\".The bucket list got a little shorter this year, but I'm thinking of adding more things to it. There really can be no end to your bucket list if you really think about it -- there is always something you want to do. I've been very fortunate all in all. I'm still pretty active physically even though not as much mentally -- but I'm hanging in there.Thanks for all your support. I'm going to try to be better about blogging in this new year.",

To mark the occasion of skating in Athens I crafted a pair of skates out of scrapbook material.Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!",

As I have mentioned before -- some of these probably should be on my bucket list because they are out of my control, but I can wish for them just the same.Bucket List -- out of my control -- kind of in order of priority if I could make them happen!1. Get tickets for myself, husband, son, daughter-in-law and brother to go to the Master's Golf Tournament in Augusta.  I've tried for years to get tickets and \"it ain't happenin\" as they say in the south.2. Become a grandparent -- definitely out of my control.3. Make a hole in one -- technically I guess I could be in control of this, but yet again, as they say in the south \"it ain't happenin\".4. Find a cure for Alzheiemer's -- definitely out of my control.Real Bucket List1. Go Skydiving2. Go to a corn maze3. Go to Denver and see a concert at Red Rocks4. Travel to Europe again5. Go on a girls weekend somewhere for fun6. Own and red Mazda Miata7. Add a screened in porch to my house8. Be skinny9. Make a difference to someone10. Have more patience with myself and my family.11. Go to Wimbledon again12. Go to ItalyI am sure in the next few months this list will change.On another thought........I have been thinking about this whole memory loss issue.  In thinking about short term memory loss, is it the fact that we cannot remember or is it the result of not processing the information?  I have found that I have a difficult time processing information, so when someone tells me something or I read it, I don't fully process that information, so I couldn't recall it if I never understood the information in the first place. I wonder if this isn't the case sometimes, rather than just forgetting something.  You can't forget something you never had in the first place.  This probably only makes sense to me!",

        "content": "There is a reason this blog is called \"Creating memories\".  It's because when I was first diagnosed with Alzheimer's the first thing I realized was that my \"memories\" would fade over time. So, I set out documenting things like the boxes and boxes of photos we had accumulated over the years.  I re-evaluated my \"bucket list\" to see how many things I could accomplish and realized that I had short time to \"create new memories\" for my family.This all came to mind when I was with my son this week.  I shared something with him that I thought I had told him long ago, and his response was \"you never told me that\".  Then he started to laugh as he recounted all the times in his almost thirty years that he had said that to me.  You honestly don't think to tell your children everything that happened in your childhood.  And, since we don't live near relatives there are not many people around recounting stories of what I did or did not do growing up.When I look back at my life growing up I realize a lot of it surrounds sports.  My oldest brother was an athlete in high school playing football and basketball.  I don't remember a lot of that because he was so much older than I was (I was in kindergarten when he went off to college), but I do remember some of his broken bones from football.  Long after my brother was out of college he returned home and by then I had taken up many sports including figure skating, tennis and golf, to name a few.  My brother played golf on his college team so when he came home we started playing golf together. When I started working full time, every morning at 5:00 a.m. we would meet at the golf course and play nine holes before we would go off to work. That's how I really got to know my older brother.My other brother who is two years older than I am was always playing baseball, bowling, basketball or golf.  I was a tomboy and always wanted to be out in the school yard next to our house to play with the guys.  He would put me in the outfield (knowing I hated it), and then would complain to my mom that I was out there turning cartwheels instead of paying attention to the game (which I was).My dad loved to fish.  He fished almost every day of his life.  He was really into tying his own fishing flies.  My brothers didn't like to go fishing -- they said it was boring.  I wanted to go with my dad, just because I wanted to spend time with him.  He worked nights and would come home and make himself some breakfast, go fishing, come home sleep, get up and start all over again.  So, when I was in school he was  fishing or sleeping and when I was home, he was at work.  So weekends were my time to go fishing with my dad.  He also accompanied my brother and I out on the golf course. Since my dad passed away over thirty years ago, those memories of just the two of us in the boat on hot summer days are precious to me.  I hate to think I will lose them.My sports were figure skating (and the competitions that went along with that), tennis and golf.  I played an occasional summer league of softball every now and then, but girls were not encouraged into sports when I was growing up.  I loved to be outside so sports is what I was doing, whether on a frozen pond in the winter, or a tennis court in the summer (plus indoor tennis in the winter in Illinois).The reason I went into this is that many of my \"memories\" of growing up revolved around sports.  (I was also heavily involved in theater and music but that is for another blog entry.) On my bucket list there are many sporting events that I still want to see and experience with my son.  I'm only reminded of this as this week I received my annual \"you did not get tickets in the lottery for the Master's tournament\" again -- I've been trying for a long time.  I want to experience that with him as well as my brother -- and although we all enter the lottery every year we don't get tickets.  I also put in the lottery for tickets for an NCAA Final Four men's basketball tournament.  I've experienced a Final Four women's tournament with my son, but the men's side is more exciting.  So, we will keep trying and hope that those items come off that bucket list while I am still able to enjoy them.When we think of \"memories\" it is mostly about experiences.  My husband doesn't enjoy \"experiences\".  If I could spend my money any way I wanted I would travel and experience some of the things the world has to offer as well as those sporting events I would like to see.  My husband enjoys \"things\".  He wants to be able to look at something, hold it, and cherish it.  He didn't have a lot growing up so this is important to him.  We didn't have a lot growing up either, but we had tennis rackets, ice skates and baseballs!  So, we argue a lot in our house about vacations versus things. Making memories is not that important to him.  Fortunately (the way I see it anyway) my son is on my side when it comes to experiences -- he tries to buy gifts for us like tickets to a show, sporting event or to an event we would like to see.So, I will try to experience what I can and hopefully my son will have fond memories of some of our experiences together -- long after I will be able to remember them.",

The things on my mind are weighing heavily on me right now.  I used to be able to let things go, but that is more difficult for me now.  I focus on them so much that they eat away at me.  My patience wears thin and I can get pretty cranky.  When I was young and someone would tell me that I was cranky I would go take a nap and that seemed to help.  Taking a nap these days doesn't help so much.I just re-read this and it rambles -- sorry about that.  Can't seem to capture the words the way I want them today.",

        "content": "It's hard for me to write this, but considering this is a blog about Dealing With Alzheimer's I must.  This past Monday was really hard.My husband was in St. Louis visiting his family.  those of you that follow my blog know that I usually enjoy my time alone when he leaves -- it's real quiet and peaceful!  And, it had been for several days. But then Monday morning came around.I had purchased a new fishing rod and reel on Sunday.  On Monday morning, I went to adjust the line and get it in working order.  When I started to do it, it confused me.  I couldn't quite figure out how to do it -- but it's pretty simple you know?  I got frustrated pretty quickly and thought I'll just put it aside and come to it later.  I then decided to go into my craft room and try to clean and straighten up the mess I had in there.  When I went into the room, I couldn't clean it.  I looked at everything -- there were stacks of paper everywhere, scissors, scraps of paper on the floor, etc.  I knew that eventually I had to run the vacuum in that room, but I couldn't figure out how to pick things up off the floor in order to vacuum.  I couldn't pick up the stacks of paper I had laying around and organize them or even straighten them to put away in their nice cubby hole.  How hard is it to pick something up off the floor?  But I could not do it.   I decided to try something else.I then went to do some laundry.  I got the clothes in the washing machine, but I couldn't figure out how to turn the washer on.  I should be able to do that in my sleep right?I decided to leave that task and go outside for some fresh air. I had a major panic attack and couldn't go outside.I had become a prisoner in my own house and couldn't do anything. I realized I was not in a good situation with all of this happening.  I called several friends at home and at work and either they were not home or they weren't in their office.  So, I broke down.  I'm not a \"crier\", but I started to cry and I didn't stop.  I tried to call my husband in St. Louis -- he knows how I get when things like this happen.  But he wasn't answering his phone.  Then I called my son.  He has not experienced me this way and I am sure I scared him.  When I am like this, I can only tell you that \"I can't do anything\".  I am not capable of telling you all the things I can't do -- all I can get out of my mouth is \"I can't do anything\".  I'm sure when my son picked up the phone and I was sobbing out of control he figured something had happened to me or his dad.  He offered to come over but I told him no I just needed to hear his voice.  After that phone call I finally got in touch with my husband, and although he wasn't here with me, he understood what was happening to me and it made me feel better.  But it makes me feel so stupid when I can't do the simplest things. Logically, I know I am not stupid, but I can't get that out of my mind.  I had thought of calling a neighbor to come help me but I didn't want to tell them that I couldn't turn my washer on!   I feel like I have a big \"S\" on my head for stupid.The thing about these episodes is that I know what I am suppose to do, but I cannot physically do it.  It's like the instructions are written in a foreign language. The thought is in my brain but it can't be relayed into action. As you can imagine it is very frustrating.  Things like this happen to me all the time, but not usually all at one time. Luckily, I didn't have anything that I absolutely had to do that day and of course I didn't.  I honestly don't remember much of the rest of the day other than my husband and son both called to check on me.  I was still crying a lot during the day which is not like me.The rest of the week has been much better compared to my Meltdown Monday.",

But\nHallmark hadn't caught on to that, so I expressed my feelings another way.So as Mother’s Day approaches I wanted to “remember” some\nthings from my experience as a mother so if you’ll indulge me in this I have a\nfew things to say to my son –Dear Alan –I remember ---Reading\n     Curious George books to you over and over and overYou\n     correcting me if I missed a word here and thereYour\n     kindergarten teacher calling to tell me she didn’t feel comfortable\n     reading a story your wrote about how babies were made because it was too real for the other children\n     to hear – you have your father to thank for that!The\n     “marble incident”The\n     first time I saw you singing in a school play – I had no ideaYour\n     “first crush” that was not reciprocatedHow\n     nervous I used to get when you were in musical theater productions.  I don’t know how athletes’ mothers\n     handle it!That\n     you didn't seem embarrassed when we did a few shows together – thank you\n     for that opportunityHow\n     you used “the marble incident” as the topic for an important paper“Date\n     night” – did I really think I was teaching you how to act on a date?When\n     you got mononucleosis your freshman year in college and worried about your\n     gradesTelling\n     you about my Alzheimer’s diagnosis and sharing some tears with you.  That’s when you told me about meeting\n     Jennifer – your future wife.You\n     being miffed that Yale put you on a waiting list forLawSchoolWatching\n     you deliver a speech inMaconon our family’s battle with Alzheimer’sYour\n     law school graduation from Stanford – you worked hard for thatYou\n     coming to my rescue in aNew York\n       Citysubway on the way out to Flushing Meadow for\n     the US OpenIce\n     skating inRockefellerCenter, in Pentagon Row inWashingtonDCand inAtlanta– notwithstanding Dad’s broken\n     elbowYou\n     telling us that you wanted to move closer to home once you finished your\n     clerkship in DCGiving\n     you all the letters I had written you over the years on the eve of your\n     wedding – that was hard for both of usOf\n     course, the weddingYou\n     and Jennifer buying your first house.As I write this, I chuckle to myself at all the things you\nwould probably remember differently – but it’s Mother’s Day and it’s my\nturn!  Seriously, you and Jennifer have\nso many more memories to make in the years to come.

At the time, I thought it sounded like a good idea.  The Race accepts 60,000 people every year.....yes, 60,000 people.  You have to enter a lottery to get a spot.  Well, wouldn't you know that we won a spot from the lottery.  Why couldn't I have won the Georgia lottery, or the lottery for Master's tickets, or the lottery for Final Four tickets -- no I have to win the lottery for the Peachtree Road Race.  So, I'm starting to get motivated and when I can at least walk for exercise I'll gear up for running and train for the next few months.  I'll probably be the last person over the finish line, but I'll finish one way or another.The problem I know I will have is -- the sheer number of people.  I dont do well in crowds as I have chronicled before -- but considering we will be in the back on the pack I probably won't be in much of a crowd, but one just the same.  We'll see how this all goes.  Luckily my son and daughter-in-law will be with me, or at least at the start of the race anyway!A friend of mne passed away a few weeks ago. She valiantly battled ovarian cancer for the last 13 years.  She was a fighter, but I know she is in a better place now.  Another friend lost his mothr this weekend and it is always hard to lose a parent.  My thoughts are with both families this weekend.Thanks to Northridge Medical Center in Commerce Georgia for having me come to speak to their Alzheimer's 101 Class a few weeks ago.  The group was great and I enjoyed seeing everyone.  I'll be speaking in Cleveland Georgia April 27th at the Pilot Club if anyone is interested. You can leave me a message or send me an email and I'll give you specifics.I go to the neurologist in the morning.  Lots of things have been happening there that I'm not going into here, but we'll see how my appointment goes tomorrow.As I mentioned earlier, I've been having trouble communicating.  A problem I am having with a friend of mine, I think stems from the problem I have in communicating.  It is hard to explain and I don't know if it is a matter of the friendship just losing its luster, or the communications problem.  I hate it, but I don't know what to do about it.  I try to work hard on keeping my friendships up, but sometimes, it is time to let go.  Maybe I have come to that point.Hope everyone had a good Easter.",

We use the word all the time.  \"I just love that dress!\"  \"Wouldn't you love to have that car?\"  There's puppy love, first loves, our \"only love\", the love of my life......you get the picture. When you're in a relationship for the first time, it's always tense until one person finally utters those three little words.  In my family growing up, we didn't say \"I love you\" very often.  I guess it was a given.  I never really gave it much thought.  We were a loving family, but those words just didn't tumble out of our mouths.  And, most of the people I knew didn't say it that often to others in their family.  Maybe because I grew up in the Midwest -- I'm not trying to stereotype here.....however, when I moved to the south over 30 years ago that is one of the things I noticed first.......how many times people said \"I love you\".  Because I heard it so much it didn't really seem genuine to me.  It's kind of like hearing people at the bank or the grocery saying \"have a nice day\", instead of just saying thank you.  You don't really hear it the same.After moving to the South I started to give it some more thought.  My first thought was, do people really think I don't love them because I don't say it very often?  Will they really hear what I am saying when I say it?My husband is very quiet and reserved and for him to say those three little words is something short of a miracle, so I don't push it.  But when I had my son I couldn't say it enough -- and I was certain that was something I wanted him to say frequently.  I think I got him to say that more than \"Yes ma'am and No Ma'am\" which is sacred in the south as well.  But at least I love you worked on him even if I couldn't make the Yes ma'am No ma'am thing stick. (As you can see I'm shooting 50% here with husband and son)I've become more comfortable with telling people I know how important they are to me and yes, that I even love them.  I used to think that that was just for those in our immediate family who we were almost bonded to love because they were a part of us.  It took me a long time to realize that my friends that are important to me are worthy of the \"I love you\" phrase and it should be said more often.Over the holidays a very long time friend (who also happens to be a native northerner) said \"I Love You\" to me and I was so taken by it I didn't know how to respond.  Isn't that an interesting response after thinking I had actually broken that barrier.  I was proud of myself for also saying those three little words before we parted.  It made me feel good.  And, this week, I received a very touching email from a friend and she signed it \"I love you\". And, even though we have exchanged those words to each other frequently it still moved me.Don't wait....tell someone you love them.....you'll never know how that will lift someone's mood.",

We shared the day with my great niece who goes to Emory in Atlanta, my daughter-in-laws parents and her sister.  It was a great day....quiet and Jen and Alan did the cooking so it was an easy day for me.Last weekend we spent time in Memphis with my nephew Jonathan and my sister-in-law Fran.  Jonathan ran his first marathon there.  I was so proud of him.  He ran in the St. Jude marathon.  Many years ago my great nephew had leukemia and was treated by St. Jude.  When Jonathan was looking for a marathon he chose the St. Jude charity as they had helped our family so much.  Jonathan came down from Champaign Illinois and brought his mom -- Fran. I was so glad she could come as she has been pretty much housebound the past six years caring for my oldest brother who passed away this summer.  We rented a house while in Memphis and spent some time catching up and enjoying Jonathan's accomplishments. But it was a tiring weekend and it took me all week to rest up after the long drive to Memphis.Now that Christmas is almost upon us, I am trying my best to stay with my routine but it is hard.  I feel like I am a \"day late and dollar short\" with all the things I want to do, but feel overwhelmed.  I've asked my family for no presents this year, as I really don't need anything and I just want time with my family.  That is more precious to me and the best gift of all.",

It will be held at Moon's Grove Baptist Church, 1985 Moon's Grove Church Road in Colbert Georgia from 11am to 1 p.m. The event will feature jewelry sales (all proceeds go to the Walk to End Alzheimer's), gel nail manicures, raffles and lots of fun for everyone.  Information about Alzheimer's will be available. Also, my friend Kathy will be walking with us this year in the Walk To End Alzheimer's....see below.  She is asking everyone that comes to the event to bring a framed photo in honor or in memory of someone they know that has (had) Alzheimer's.  Kathy wants to then take a photo of all the photos gathered at the event and carry this photo with her in the walk.  She also wants families to sign a t-shirt she will wear on the day of the walk to remember and honor all of her friends and their families that are dealing with Alzheimer's.  It sounds like a great event and I would encourage all of those living out near Colbert to take a few minutes and go by Moon's Grove Baptist Church on Saturday October 11th and say hello to Kathy and do your part to End Alzheimer's.1985 Moon's Grove Church Road - Colbert, GA 30628  -  706-7This year's Athens Walk To End Alzheimer's is Saturday October 25th.

But the end is near for him -- the past week has seen a heart attack and two strokes among other things. He left the hospital today to go home to be with loved ones for his final few days.  We have known this day was coming -- but quite truthfully I thought this \"time\" had come many times before. Now that it is finally here we know that he will be in a better place shortly and in no pain. He is surrounded by his family.Bill is 13 years older than me so I didn't real know him as a brother. When I was in kindergarten he was in college. I vaguely remember going to some basketball and football games he played in high school. I also remember some times when he baby sat for me and my other brother (who is only two years older than me). After my brother graduated from college he lived away from home, then married. So, I really never spent a lot of time with him until we were both adults. When I was out on my own, we only lived a few miles apart and worked in office buildings across the street from each other. For about a year, every morning we would meet at 5am and play nine holes of golf together. It still gave us time to go to our respective houses and change and get ready for work.  It is kind of strange that that is what I remember the most. I can't remember who won the golf games, but I would be surprised if I won any of them since he played golf on his college team. I am just grateful he shared that time with me.He has requested no funeral, no memorial service and doesn't even want an obituary in the paper. That is they way he wants it so that is the way it will be. He will leave his wife of 45 years, three children, eight grandchildren and his first great grandchild is due in another monthSince Bill was so much older than Tom and I he was much different than we were. He was partly raised by my grandparents who lived next door to us. We always joked that he came from a different gene pool than we did.  There are a lot of funny stories to share, but those will be saved for another time. He will be missed.",

This year -- I'm not running or walking -- just watching.  My son and daughter-in-law are going to be running again and I am just going to watch them go by! I do have an excuse this year, a few weeks ago I had my left knee replaced.  Three years ago I had my right one replaced and it was time for the left one to follow the same surgery.  I forgot a lot about what it was like, but my physical therapy is kicking into high gear and it is kicking me in the butt!  I don't remember it hurting like that before but it probably did.  Anyway, in a couple of months I will be good as new (well maybe not quite true) but will be much better off than I was a month or so ago.Today is \"The Longest Day\" as it is the summer solstice. However, you may have also seen a little publicity about Alzheimer's Longest Day.  Today, many groups and organizations are helping to raise money for Alzheimer's by doing an activity all day.  For instance, there is a group here in Athens that is playing bridge all day and raising money.  Others are running, sailing, playing scrabble, walking, playing basketball, etc. to help raise awareness and much needed funds for research.  Thanks to all of those that are participating this year.  I hope next year, I can organize some of my friends and we can play Pickleball all day long!",

My son is not a bad person by any stretch of the imagination, and I am very proud of what he has made of himself, but I am disappointed in some of the ways he has dealt with some things and I feel responsible because I didn't do a good enough job in teaching him.

I was thinking that now, though, I would have had a number of panic attacks and not sure how I would have handled being stranded on interstate roads for that long.   A silly think (or maybe not so silly) is that I still keep in my trunk, a duffel bag with \"necessities\" including water, make-up, and overnight essentials.  I know that sounds silly, but I used to travel in my job at the spur of the moment so I always had a bag packed in my trunk.  It came in handy even if I wasn't travelling.  My husband gives me a hard time, but it is my \"comfort\", so he just has to deal with it!2.Drug trials-- was disappointed that two drugs that seemed to hold some promise for those of us with Alzheimer's have not been proven in recent drug trials. This is so disappointing.Here is an excerpt from an article published in US News and World Report: \"Two experimental drugs for Alzheimer's disease have failed their clinical trials, proving unable to help patients with mild to moderate dementia, according to new studies.Both bapineuzumab and solanezumab did not improve patients' ability to think and solve problems, according to findings published in the Jan. 23 issue of theNew England Journal of Medicine.The drugs were intended to help people with Alzheimer's by clearing the amyloid beta protein plaques that typically clog neurons in the brains of people with the degenerative illness, the researchers said.Neither medication improved patients' ability to think. \"We were disappointed there was no clear clinical benefit,\" said Dr. Steven Salloway, lead researcher on the bapineuzumab study. Salloway is a professor of neurology and psychiatry at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.\"  You can read the whole article here:http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2014/01/22/2-alzheimers-drugs-found-ineffective-in-clinical-trials3.On a better note-- A funding bill for the 2014 federal budged included the largest increase in funding dedicated to Alzheimer's and dementia - $122 million in funding for Alzheimer's research, education, outreach and caregiver support in history. You can read more about that news at:http://www.alz.org/news_and_events_122_mill_posposed.asp4.On a bright and happy note-- my friend author Lisa Genova who wrote Still Alice announced yesterday the full cast of the film adaptation of Still Alice.  It was announced previously that Julianne Moore would play Alice.  Others cast include Alec Baldwin, Kristen Stewart, and Kate Bosworth.  Filming is set to start soon.  I couldn't be happier for Lisa.  Lisa lives in Cape Cod and this article appeared today in Cape Cod Today --http://www.capecodtoday.com/article/2014/01/29/23796-hollywood-bring-chatham-authors-still-alice-silver-screenLisa was in Columbus Georgia this weekend, and unfortunately, I wasn't able to get to visit with her due to some other commitments.  I was sad about that, but I am so happy for her that this film is closer and closer to a reality.",

We'd laugh at ourselves, understood things only we would know about and share our families. Several times Bob and I shared a stage at meetings about Alzheimer's and he his wife were featured in Washington at one of the Public Policy Forums.  Bob's wife, Trish, first contacted me through this blog and since we lived close we got together.  Bob was only a year older than I was and we all seemed to get along well.  One of their children was going to UGA at the time, so they came to Athens often and came to our Walk to End Alzheimer's here in Athens for several years.  I always thought of Bob as a \"gentle giant\". He was not big, but he was tall -- I was always looking up to him (both literally and figuratively) and he was soft spoken, loved his family and was very aware of what he was dealing with.  Unfortunately, Bob's type of Alzheimer's was definitely inherited and he had been dealing with it in several members of his family for some time.  This type tends to be more aggressive than other types.  Bob was a runner and his family shared his passion.

The book can be found on Amazon.Several friends have been dealing with some different health problems and I guess as we get older that is going to happen.  I don't think we necessarily see ourselves as older so sometimes thinking about my friends and what they are dealing doesn't seem possible. But then, they probably say that about me too.I don't know if many of the things I am experiencing now are just due to old age or the disease but many of the things I am experiencing aren't pleasant for me and I am sure they are not pleasant for my friends.  I hate it -- my emotions are all over the place and I never know how I am going to react to things.  Sometimes it just isn't pretty.  I know I am thankful that I still have friends -- despite how awful I must seem to them at times.",

I had played a few games and was doing o.k., but then I was playing with my husband (fortunately he was my partner) and all of a sudden it was like the walls were closing in on me, I got confused, didn't know what I was suppose to do and I had a full blown panic attack.  It has been awhile since I had one and I can usually feel them coming on, but not this one. I had to get out of the gym as fast as I could. My husband realized what was going on and helped to get me out. it was as if the whole world was spinning around me and I could not get off the carousel. It is hard to explain, but it can be terrifying if you do not know what is happening for you. I went outside to get away from everything, but I couldn't set foot back in the gym.

What stuck out to me the most is the diagnostic rate of Alzheimer's.  In a nutshell, it says that only 45% of the patients are actually getting a diagnosis of Alzheimer's from their doctors.  We knew this, but now there is data to back it up.  This is a shame for a lot of reasons -- the biggest one to me is that for those diagnosed early, it hinders their ability to get Social Security Disability and other forms of help they so desperately need.  This, also doesn't help the stigma situation with the disease.  So much needs to be done in this area.Last week, I met with several other people with a reporter from Atlanta Magazine.  They are doing a Health issue in July and Alzheimer's will be featured in one of the articles.  As part of our panel discussion, we were able to call my friend Lisa Genova - author of Still Alice for her take on what has happened since she first wrote the book and since the movie's release.  By the way, Lisa has a new book out this week about Huntington's Disease.  I haven't read it yet, but if it is as good as the rest of her books I will be recommending it.I have had lots of comments and emails in the last few weeks from readers of the blog and I have been really slow to respond.  I promise I will try to get to everyone this week.  I appreciate all of your feedback.",

Watching Alice cope with things, knowing what was going through her mind was wrenching for me.  The words she spoke were the exact same words I have spoken to my family or friends. It was almost scary to see it -- to have her feel what you have felt and not being able to communicate it to others.  It is very moving -- I didn't cry until close to the end.  It was when Alice's daughter gives birth to twins and Alice goes to visit her in the hospital. When she asks to hold the baby her son-in-law gives his wife a look as if he is saying \"is she capable of holding the baby?\".  Alice very quickly says \"I know how to hold a baby\" and the new father gives her one of the babies to hold.  This got to me because I have had this same scenario in my mind many times.  My son and his wife don't have children yet, but I have silently worried that if and when they do -- they won't feel as if I will be capable of holding the baby or being an appropriate grandmother.  After that scene, the floodgates opened for me.  There were many tears in the theatre that day. I was emotionally spent after the movie.At the end the screen goes white and people literally just sat in their seats and stared at the screen.  It was very emotional.On the way back to my son's house, not much was said in the car.  Everyone was just trying to digest what they had seen.  Since they hadn't read the book, I think the impact of the movie was pretty strong.Many who read this blog don't actually know me -- but if you see Still Alice -- you will know me. Thanks to Lisa Genova, the author of Still Alice (and a friend of mine) for writing such an epic novel. She had no idea when writing this book several years ago what an impact it would have on the Alzheimer's community. I am so grateful to her and her work.Still Alice is still in limited release but by the end of February it should be in many more theatres. Don't miss the opportunity to see Julianne Moore's portrayal of Alice.",

My feelings get hurt very easily. I have written before how it has been hard for me to let go of things. I don't know why I can't keep my emotions in check. I don't know if I am imagining things, reading into things wrong, or just losing it at times. But it really affects me when I am left out, forgotten or people just don't care enough, when I have put my heart and soul into a friendship that people do some of the things they do. If I say something to them, they think I am being petty -- but it isn't petty to me. We all have our thresholds I guess and mine is pretty low.a couple of weeks ago I had two funerals in one day. It brought sorrow and joy into my life -- sorrow for losing two individuals  so young, but joy to know how well they were loved and by getting to see so many people that helped celebrate their life. Tomorrow brings yet another funeral. I guess as we get older, funerals become the norm, but it is still hard.This week I suffered a head injury and the doctor has deemed it a concussion. Can't say I have ever had one of those, but it isn't pleasant.Also this week I sat down and wrote several letters -- yes, actual letters. I like writing letters \"the old fashioned way\". One of the letters was to a man that I went to college with that has had a lasting affect on me. Every time I went back to Illinois I would say I want to go by and see him. I never got around to it. so, I finally decided to sit down and tell him what our friendship meant to me and how he showed me a different way of thinking and how grateful I was to have had him as a friend.

I started reflecting on the last year and was going to write all kinds of things, but realized they are probably only meaningful to me so I am going to spare you from that post right now.But the past year took many people from my life and probably yours as well.  And, sickness has overcome many and some are not looking at real bright outcomes. I guess as we age that is to be expected.  I am so thankful I am here so long after my Alzheiemer's diagnosis.  I guess that is why I seem to define my life in \"time\".  Time matters. We take it for granted.  I want to spend my time doing things that matter to me not because someone expects it of me.  Everyone defines their life differently and as we mature we change those definitions every now and then.  Although my husband would never admit it, he defines his life by things.....what he has, what he wants, what he doesn't have.  He likes to be able to touch things, covet things and get better things.  I know that probably stems from not having much growing up. And, I'm sure that my definition comes from never feeling like I had time to be with some members of my family -- like my dad.  My father always worked nights so he was home when we were in school and then he would be off to work when we came home.  I know I worked alot when my son was growing up and wasn't around as much as I wanted to be and I regret that.  I know that he probably does too. So, it is something I will continue to work on -- to be there for my friends and family as best as I am able to.For Christmas this year, I asked for nothing other than time.  I asked my son to spend time with me on Mother's Day (the actual day of Mother's Day).  I know that sounds silly but sometimes due to circumstances (or distance) we weren't together and I was bothered by that.  The actual day shouldn't make a difference, but for some reason I can't let that go.  So, for Christmas my son has already made arrangements for us to be together on Mother's Day.  From my husband, I asked for acknowledgement. I asked that he acknowledge my birthday this year. That sounds pretty silly too - doesn't it?  But it doesn't cost anything and I will be grateful if he will do this.Speaking of letting it go -- I have had a hard time with that this year.  I think I have had a drastic shift in my thinking on this.  For so many years, I let things go that bothered me because I didn't want to confront it, didn't want to deal with or just couldn't be bothered.  But then I found it festering in me and getting upset with myself that I didn't deal with certain things and then found myself resenting people because of my inaction.  So now, I'm holding on to things too long and becoming frustrated so I have to find a happy medium.  Hopefully, I can do that soon.I am so thankful for my friends.  I have made a lot of new friends this year and it has opened up some things for me that I didn't think were possible.  I am truly grateful for that.I have had to make quite a few changes in my life this year and that hasn't been comfortable for some of those around me.  But, it has freed me up and I guess I am to the point where I am selfish enough now, to do things for me -- not others.  It has taken me almost 60 years to figure that out -- but better late than never -- right?Happy New Year!",

Today was actually World Alzheimer's Day.  I've had lots of requests to speak recently, but all have required some pretty long distance travel.  Usually, that isn't a problem, but one required me going to LA one day and returning the next.  With other things I have going on, there just wasn't anyway I could do that.  Traveling takes a pretty good toll on me and I know that those interviews I had to turn down, were covered by very capable people. I'm glad that Alzheimer's is getting some news time.We had our annual Walk To End Alzheimer's.  I was so proud of my team -- we raised close to $15,000.  Our Walk in Athens actually surpassed its goal this year for the first time in many years.  So excite about that and thanks to all of those that donated, walked and gave your support to my team.In about a month a new Bakowski will be joining the family.  My son Alan and his wife Jennifer Lee are due with a baby boy.  We are looking forward to this joyous occasion.Communication has become more of a problem for me.  I find it much harder to talk on the telephone, preferring emails or skyping with family.  It helps for me to be able to see the person when they are talking.I plan in the next week or so to share some new reading material about Alzheimer's so stay tuned!",

Then I had a spinal tap and that showed a build up of tau in my brain (which cause the tangles in your brain with this disease) and also a gene that carried the Alzheimer's disease.  I also did intense neuropsychological testing.  I was \"lucky\" from the standpoint that I was diagnosed at an extreme early stage of the disease.Question 3 - What kind of medicine are you on?I take Exelon (patch) and Namenda.  I have some other medicines I take that are off label that help with some of the symptoms.Question 4 - How are you still so functional?I get this question a lot.  I know many people that have been diagnosed longer than I have and are more functional than I am.  As I said, this was caught early in the disease process and I personally think that makes a difference -- although medical personnel may disagree -- that is only my take on it.  I work at it -- try to stay active both physically and mentally.  There are many many things I cannot do and I won't go into them but I struggle just like everyone else.  It isn't easy -- but I do the best that I can.It has taken a lot of effort to put down on paper what I have just written.  I used to do this with such ease and now after many hours thinking this through and writing it out several times (with help) I was able to get it this far.I appreciate everyone's comments and only hope that if you or someone you know is dealing with this disease that you get help somewhere -- there are lots of resources out there. I work closely with the Alzheimer's Association but there are others as well.  Check them out on the web and get some advice -- it doesn't cost anything to do some research and ask a few questions.  It has helped me and helped my family.On a lighter note -- we are expecting our first grand child this fall -- and I am hoping that I will be able to enjoy the little one for a long time.",

I find it is much harder to control my emotions and I will say things that I have always thought, but not allowed to get from my brain to my mouth!  That gets me into trouble, but trying to filter what I say is much much harder now.  I try to rationalize it that I am getting older and it is hard to be politically correct and to be \"nice\" but I know that isn't the real reason my outbursts explode!I am still working through that bucket list of mine.  Tomorrow, one more thing will be crossed off as I have finally gotten my brother to Georgia and we are going to the Masters together.  I have been several times and I was fortunate to have my oldest brother (now deceased) come about 20 years ago and go with me.  So, it has always been my goal to get my brother Tom here for that experience.  We golfed as kids with two brothers and my dad it made for a good foursome.  My oldest brother played golf in college and my other brother and I have played sporadically over the years.  I used to be half way decent but I don't play enough now.  I am just glad that I am able to experience this with my brother after all these years of trying to make it happen.",

I have really had to say \"no\" a lot this year to give myself some breathing room.  Activities wear me out quickly so I have to cut back on some things -- but I am still plugging along.I have been reconnected with many old friends this year and that is so nice.  It is hard to believe that I have known these people over 50 years -- that is a long time!    But it has been fun catching up with them and comparing our lives after all these years.There are lots of things to look back on and wish we had done things a different way.  But, it is the new year and I hope all of you will look forward to a productive year.",

        "content": "Yes, it has been many long months since I have added anything to this blog.  The last few chemo treatments I had this summer did a number on me.  I was sailing along pretty well and then a big old truck seemed to come smashing into me.  After my chemo finally ended, I went in for surgery. Luckily, the chemo had done its job (it should have for what I went through!) and the tumor was pretty insignificant at the time of surgery.  A few weeks later I started radiation treatments.  On November 13th I will be finished with everything.......or that is the plan anyway.  I went for my original mammogram on April 1 (no joke) and 7 months later -- I am on the verge of finishing treatment.  Of course, follow up exams will be made and I will continue to meet with my oncologist but hopefully all the nasty stuff is behind me. This is definitely not how I wanted my year to go.Through all this my Alzheimer's has \"flared up\" with my chemo brain and my Alzheimer's brain combined I had some days where it was just easier to stay in bed -- and that I did.  But, the farther and farther away I get from my original chemo treatments the better that is.  And, we just finished our Walk To End Alzheimer's last week and our team raised over $15,000. I am so proud of everyone and so very thankful for all of my friends and family for getting me through all my health battles this year. I can never thank them enough.And of course, there is this guy -- turning 11 months old. Every time I was feeling really down or really sick I got a little dose of Ian and I started smiling. I know that is what grandchildren are all about.",

        "content": "A few months ago I came across an old friend on Facebook and re-connected.  We had just lost track of each other and it was so nice to hear from her again.  One of the first questions she asked me was \"Did your son ever open up his letters you wrote him on his birthdays\". I had forgotten that I shared that with her.  If you have followed my blog you know that I the day my son was born, I wrote him a letter.  I put it in the safety deposit box and every year after that I wrote a letter on his birthday and put it in the safety deposit box.  I think at some point he knew what I was doing but we didn't talk about it.  I really enjoyed writing that letter and added photos and different things. I would collect thoughts and stories all year and save them for that day I wanted to write \"the letter\". As the years went by I wasn't sure when I wanted to give them to him......on his 18th birthday, 21st birthday, graduation.....????? When I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's these letters took on a different meaning.  I wanted to share everything with him before I forgot everything.  Some years the letters were very hard to write.I finally decided that the night before Alan got married I would give him the letters. I purchased a brown leather case. We shared time that night and it was really hard for me to give him these letters.  And, he didn't want to take them from me.  We shared a few tears and I finally convinced him that it was the right time.  I think maybe he thought I would never write him another letter, or that I had given up on life or something.  My only condition to him was that -- he could read them when he wanted but that when he did read them I wanted to know that he had.  That was almost nine years ago.On Mother's Day this year, Alan gave me a letter.  The letter said he had read my letters the week before.  I didn't ask why now but I would suspect that my cancer scare brought him to it -- not knowing what my long term prognosis is going to be.  That was a hard day.So, Jan......the answer to your question is \"Yes, Alan has read his letters.\"",

        "content": "Last Monday, May 22nd, I have had my first chemo treatment.  In an update to my last post, the other tumors that were located in my body were benign and I was doing the \"happy dance\". I told friends later that I was so relieved to \"just have breast cancer\", that I never thought I would hear myself even mutter those words.So, Chemo started last Monday. Monday wasn't too bad but the ensuing days have added lots of new side effects, lots of sensations, lots of highs and lots of lows. But, this too will pass.  There are many many people much worse off than I am so I am thankful for everything that comes my way.  I went to purchase a wig. Not sure how much I am going to wear it, but by this time next week, I shouldn't have any hair. Right now it doesn't seem to bother me, but it probably will when I see it dropping to the ground in clumps.  The good thing is that I don't have another chemo appointment until June 19th. It was suppose to be earlier but we had planned a trip to visit family in Illinois and the doctor thought it would be good for me to go, so we will delay chemo for one week during that cycle.  After getting back on track I will have chemo through the first part of August, followed by surgery and then 5-7 weeks of radiation every day.This guy makes me smile -- he turned six months old this week.",

(National Active and Retired Federal Employees) -- I was one of their keynote speakers and they were great.  Thanks to all of you for having me there -- I enjoyed my time and getting to know some of your members.  This organization gives very very generously to the Alzheimer's Association not only on a state level but on a national one as well.  We are very grateful for all they do.As I mentioned in my previous posts, I'm dealing with this breast cancer thing. Since then, a few things have changed.  My chemotherapy treatments that were suppose to start this week didn't. Last week I had a CT scan of my torso and a tumor was found in my liver.  In addition, a bone scan indicated there was a \"suspicious\" spot on my spine. Needless to say, these are not things we were prepared to hear.  Every time I go to the doctor I find more things I didn't want to hear and certainly weren't expecting to hear.So, tomorrow I sill have another CT scan of my abdomen and my pelvic are so they can get a better look at the liver tumor.  A few days after that (we hope) there will be a biopsy done on that tumor to see if it is malignant. I will also have an MRI on my spine to look closer at the spot there to determine what it is. We are in that \"hurry up and wait\" mode which is always pretty agonizing.  Our next doctor's appointment is next Thursday and we are hoping that by then the results of all of these tests are in and we can again get a course of treatment.  I hate to take more tests because they keep finding new things.All of this has been weighing heavily on my mind and my focus isn't clear. My friends and family have been there when I need them and I know they will continue to be. Please keep us in your prayers as we continue on this journey.",

        "content": "Since I lasted posted I have visited an oncologist regarding the breast cancer diagnosis.  Not a fun few hours for sure, but we have a plan now and if all stays true to that I will start chemotherapy on May 10th.One thing we are concerned about is \"chemo brain\" -- a side effect from the chemotherapy.  Short term memory can be hampered as well as other things such as lack of concentration and that 'foggy\" feeling.  I know those things all too well now, I am hoping they don't get much worse.  But there isn't anything we can do about it so we are hoping for the best.After 4 cycles of chemo (one week on, two weeks off - for a total of 12 weeks) then it is on to surgery.  After I recover from surgery we will be looking at radiation for 5-7 weeks (five days a week).It is going to be a long summer.This week I still have a few tests to take to prepare for the start of chemo.I also have an Alzheimer's speech I am giving in Warner Robins Georgia which is a couple of hours away.  It has been on the schedule for a long time and it is important that I do it.Then, I have family coming in for my great niece's graduation from Emory University. So, all the things going on this week will help with me trying to keep my  mind off things -- if you can really do that.Last night my husband and I attended a Billy Joel Concert in Atlanta.  I have never seen him in concert and it was a great show.  He sang for three hours straight and all great songs.  The show was held at the Suntrust Bank Baseball Field -- the new home of the Atlanta Braves.  We decided to stay the night in a hotel which was walking distance to the stadium so we didn't have to hassle with the parking and the commute at night.  That was perfect.  When we arrived at the hotel my daughter-in-law had brought by a little \"goody bag\" for us and in it my son left this note:So cute and clever.  Made me feel good after a long morning with the oncologist.",

I know I'm prejudiced -- but he is a bundle of joy.It's spring and the weather is beautiful in the south.  Lots of things are going on with festivals, graduations and outdoor sports.This post is going to be long and probably ramble a bit, but as I titled this, indulge me.  I have a few speaking engagements coming up for the Alzheimer's Association and I have been trying to make some changes in some of my presentations.  One of the things I talk a lot about is the difference in funding research for Alzheimer's disease and other diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.  Alzheimer's is the only disease in the top ten diseases that cause death, that has no cure.  Yet, funding is proportionally lower for Alzheimer's disease that the rest.  I literally preach that we need to make Alzheimer's a CAUSE and perhaps people would look at it differently.  I know I am probably preaching to the choir here as most of you are my dear friends and give generously of your time and give financially to my \"cause\".So, this week happened.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Perhaps it hasn't sunk in yet, but my reaction to it hasn't been as devastating as I thought it would be.  We are in the initial phases or meeting with surgeons and doctors, etc. But, with breast cancer I know there is a chance for survival.  Unlike with Alzheimer's.  And, it is because of all the research, all the dollars that have been given and people speaking out about breast cancer that has made this happen.  I know many people that have had breast cancer and survived -- the treatment might not be great but the end result is. Those that have gone before me are my inspiration.Several years ago when I was speaking to a class at UGA I mentioned that at one point a doctor at Emory told me that he would hope that I would die from something other than Alzheimer's.  I have thought about that a lot.  When I said this to the students one student asked if I was faced with another devastating illness would I seek treatment.  I told her I didn't know the answer to that and would have to wait until that situation ever presented itself (if it did). Well, now here I am and yes, we will seek treatment because our chances are good and I can see a positive outcome.I'm hoping that in time our Alzheimer's cause will have the same outcome.  Please continue to speak up, give and encourage people to look at Alzheimer's as the DISEASE that it is and help us fight this dreaded disease.",
