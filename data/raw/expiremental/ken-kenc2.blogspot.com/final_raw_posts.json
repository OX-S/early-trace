The experiment was carried out on both musically experienced and inexperienced participants....+2The research involved participants listening to Mozart (pictured) for 20 minutesThe study showed that genes were enhanced in those deemed 'musically experienced' in areas such as dopamine secretion, which is when a neurohormone is released in the brain, synaptic neurotransmission, which is how neurons receive information, and learning and memory.Meanwhile, the music appeared to down-regulate genes associated with neuro-degeneration, which is the progressive loss of the structure or function of neurons.The researchers said several of the up-regulated genes were ones which are responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds.This suggests a common evolutionary background of sound perception across different species, they said.One of the most affected genes in this area was synuclein-alpha (SNCA), which is also a known risk gene for Parkinson's disease.Study leader Doctor Irma Jarvela, of Helsinki University, said: 'The up-regulation of several genes that are known to be responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds suggest a shared evolutionary background of sound perception between vocalizing birds and humans.'He added: 'The effect was only detectable in musically experienced participants, suggesting the importance of familiarity and experience in mediating music-induced effects.'Dr Jarvela added that the findingscould give give further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying music therapy.The effects of this are still largely unknown.",

This will hopefully support further research and findings in future, which will improve the lives of people living with LBD and their carers.We are very grateful to the team at the University of Cambridge for providing this update, and look forward to hearing further updates as the study progresses. We must also say thank you to all the supporters and fundraisers who help to fund our research programme. Although the studies can often take a number of years to produce results, this work shows that your donations are making a real difference.Progress report \u2013 MEG Dementia with Lewy Bodies, University of CambridgeOverall progress towards the goal of the award and key achievementsThe first goal of this study (known as Multimodal Imaging in Lewy Body Disorders or MILOS study) was to discover novel imaging biomarkers for Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using multimodal imaging (MEG and MRI). The second goal was to correlate clinical symptoms such as cognitive fluctuations with different imaging measures. The originally planned sample size was 48, in which 24 subjects with clinically diagnosed probable DLB and 24 similarly aged healthy controls as a comparator group, who will undergo full clinical, neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessment, MRI, and MEG scans. To date, we have recruited 47 participants, in which 30 have completed baseline tests including brain scans and blood sampling, 25 completed one-year follow-up and 7 completed 2-year follow-up.IWe have done a preliminary analysis of the imaging data and found promising results. For example, there are notable decreases in the \u2018stability\u2019 of the brain waves and processing speed (reaction time) during simple object recognition tasks in patients with DLB compared with healthy controls. This seems to be consistent with their clinical phenotypes such as cognitive fluctuations.Between 2015 and 2017, we have received three substantial competitive funding awards for related research with a total value of nearly \u00a3476,000. At the same time novel imaging methods have emerged, so we have decided to expand the study with additional PET brain scans. With PET, we have investigated changes in amyloid load (a key pathology associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease). We found a trend towards increased amyloid load in subcortical and brain stem areas in DLB.Finally, the additional funding has supported two post-doctoral researchers who have assisted patient recruitment, testing and data analysis. During the period of this study, three PhD students joined the team supported by external studentships. It is also notable that the awardee of this grant has been offered a full professorship from University of Sheffield in 2020. This grant was the first major award the awardee has received thus played a vital role in this achievement.Issues that have limited the progressThe first issue that has limited the progress was the speed at which we can recruit suitable patients with DLB. This is because DLB is a much rarer disease compared with AD and it progresses faster too. Our research project requires the participants to perform several simple but nonetheless active tasks on computer. So, there is only a narrow window of time for the patients to participate when their cognitive impairment is still relatively mild.We have improved the recruitment of these milder DLB patients by better engaging with the public via newsletters, public event and social media. We have also increased the number of patient recruiters including additional post docs and PhD students, and an ARUK funded DLB coordinator in Cambridge. We have also linked up with other researchers in Cambridge working on DLB related projects in order to share sources of patients.Finally, the study was paused during the Covid pandemic. Both patient recruitment and testing had to be suspended for approximately 12 months. However, we used the time to concentrate on data analysis and writing up reports. As soon as face to face research could restart, we have continued the recruitment. As mentioned previously, to date, we have recruited a total of 47 participants out of the target of 48. With the additional funding from the other sources, we will complete the final part of the recruitment shortly.In the coming years, we will actively work on the data collected from this study for publications and disseminate the results in conferences and via other channels while completing all the patient follow-up.(Date 27 May 2021)Li Su, PhDProfessor of Neuroimaging,University of SheffieldARUK Senior Research Fellow,University of Cambridge",

When this started we had a dog which used to lie near my feet, so I learnt to tell if they were real or not, because if he saw a spider he would chase it, But my wife told me that if he did not move, then they were not real.That was fine until he passed away then it was left to me to decide. These days my wife tells me if there is something there or not, because she watches me looking at something and asks what is wrong. However life can be difficult at times trying to work out whether something is real, or if my brain is playing tricks with me. Even outside I have to look more than once to see if something is real, and this can be hard when people are watching me to see what is going on. The brain is a very complicated thing, when I hear about it, because I never realised that it controls what we see, hear, and smell etc, and this causes problems when I get my eyesight tested.This is  because my eyesight seems to change so much, and where I thought it was just my eyes playing up, I now understand it\u2019s the brain getting the wrong signals, if I got this right.

It\u2019s my own personal view that we need to just get things done to make us comfortable.Some people are needle phobic, and some like me struggle when people get close up, in front of my face.I confess that I don\u2019t want expensive treatment, and never have done, and this is always taken on board.Recently I had to have a tooth removed as the fillings kept coming out, even though different types of fillings were tried.As there was little left of the tooth due to bad treatment in the past it was decided to remove the tooth before it was too late.During this process the dentist kept stopping to see if I needed a break and to see if I was alright, something I had never come across ever before.This is what I call real dental treatment to suit the person living with this illness, not a dentist who is out to get as much money out of us as possibleSome have even tried to get me to have expensive crowns, when I simply don\u2019t want themI believe that dentists should ask a patient for their thoughts before going ahead with expensive treatment.Ask rather than assume you know best",

A few years ago Peter Ashley an old friend and myself, who at the time were both Ambassadors with the Alzheimer\u2019s Society helped to write a booklet about Lewy Body Dementia, and this included the graphic nightmares etc. This was before the Lewy Body Society had got off the ground, or at least I had not heard about it, and it was only later on that Peter told me about it.After the first publication was released, it was then scrapped by a new editor, who thought it was too graphic and would frighten people, needless to say both Peter and I lost interest, because it was obvious that this person knew nothing about the horrors of this illness. So in future editions the nightmares were removed from the booklet, yet this left many wondering why.Yet as many people have said, these graphic nightmares are all part of the nightly horrors many people living with this illness have to put up with.These can be horrific when they start, and sometimes very hard to break free from. While these are going on it\u2019s possible that the person going through the horror can lash out and cause a lot of damage, as I found to my horror over time. I demolished two bedside lamps along with other things.It\u2019s worth pointing out that our loved ones can be hurt if they get too close when trying to walk us up, as my wife found out one night, and she ended up with a black eye, something which I found very distressing the next morning. While doing this research it was obvious that they wanted me to change my sleep patterns, which included going to bed earlier, but as I always wake up at 6-30: each morning I did not see the sense, and another idea was to go to bed much later, but as my wife pointed out I still get up at the same time, so that means less sleep.It was pointed out that some days I drop off to sleep straight after lunch for an hour or so, and nothing wakes me up, not even a telephone ringing next to me chair. I have no control over this yet they said it was bad to sleep during the day. But I have no control over this it just happens and can be embarrassing if we have visitors in the house.",

When she rang the doctors surgery, they sent a link and my wife to photograph the lump and send it back to the doctors via this link. Needless to say it did not work, and after trying a few times, we just gave up and my wife rang up to explain that she is not into technology and could not get it to work.After this we were given an appoint to to see a nurse practitioner who started the process going. I confess that some of these nurse practitioners are better than some of today\u2019s doctors, but that\u2019s life.On top of this we are no longer allowed to ask for repeat prescriptions, you are supposed to do this in line yet again, although you can go to your doctors and put the repeat into a letter box to get processed.I find all of this technology is going over the top, as it\u2019s going too fast, and many of us cannot cope.It feels as if we are having everything done by robots these days and it\u2019s becoming frightening for me, but there are others who may find this too much.Is this another form of discrimination, I do wonder, because it\u2019s causing more and more confusion to those of us with memory issues",

The problem was that I have memory problems and find it hard to explain things at times, so I took this as an insult, especially as I had gone in with a suspected chest infection, which he said was nothing more than a cold.Strangely after doing a sputum test that afternoon, I left feeling very upset, only to get a phone call a few days later telling me that I needed a course of strong antibiotics for a chest infection.However this bowel problem caused me to lose quite a lot of weight, but I could not war a belt to keep my trousers up so I had to resort to wearing bracers, something I never liked.After scans X-rays and other tests over Christmas, I eventually got a phone call from the consultant telling me it was not cancer, something I had never even considered, but the rest of the symptoms were ignored until last month when I got another phone call telling me that I had something called microscopic colitis, similar to crohns disease, but this was not explained.I was told to go on a large dose of steroids for 8 weeks, then I would be contacted again. He told me to take them all in one dose 9 mg a day, but I was in agony and did not want to eat.My wife rang our doctors and they said I had to split the dose to 3 timesaver day, until the consultant came back to them.This has been a big help and although my diet has totally changed to dairy free, to cut down the cramps and bloating.",

I could eat them all day.The last time we flew to Turkey we were given lunch going out, and breakfast coming back, but somehow these got mixed up, and I ended up with a Thia curry for Breakfast?I confess that this was novel but really enjoyed it.

The experiment was carried out on both musically experienced and inexperienced participants....+2The research involved participants listening to Mozart (pictured) for 20 minutesThe study showed that genes were enhanced in those deemed 'musically experienced' in areas such as dopamine secretion, which is when a neurohormone is released in the brain, synaptic neurotransmission, which is how neurons receive information, and learning and memory.Meanwhile, the music appeared to down-regulate genes associated with neuro-degeneration, which is the progressive loss of the structure or function of neurons.The researchers said several of the up-regulated genes were ones which are responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds.This suggests a common evolutionary background of sound perception across different species, they said.One of the most affected genes in this area was synuclein-alpha (SNCA), which is also a known risk gene for Parkinson's disease.Study leader Doctor Irma Jarvela, of Helsinki University, said: 'The up-regulation of several genes that are known to be responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds suggest a shared evolutionary background of sound perception between vocalizing birds and humans.'He added: 'The effect was only detectable in musically experienced participants, suggesting the importance of familiarity and experience in mediating music-induced effects.'Dr Jarvela added that the findingscould give give further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying music therapy.The effects of this are still largely unknown.",

        "content": "Since before just before I was formally diagnosed as having Early-onset Lewy Body Dementia, I have struggled with very bad dreams and in some cases nightmares.These things have little or no direct link to normal life that I know of, and they are very frightening, and sometimes difficult to break free from.I remember the first one I had which I told my consultant about when I saw her at the clinic.It was at this point that I learned that these were all caused by my illness and not medication of any kind.On some occasions, I have got out of bed and gone to a different room simply to break the cycle or at least try to.I say that because when we wake up from these horrors as I call them, its difficult to decide the difference between the nightmare andreality. I have at times resorted to doing things like hitting the wall so that I know I am awake, but then that leads to sore hands the next morning.Sometimes after doing something like watching television for half an hour, I have returned to bed only to find the whole process start again from the point it stopped. That is also very sad as I get out of bed feeling very tired and stressed.When I have these really bad horrors during the night, I can usually remember the whole thing in great detail for at least two days afterward, and I have written about these before, as a way of trying to find out what is causing it all to happen.I often wonder why it is people having these don't end up having a heart attack as they are so bad, perhaps they do and it's not looked into as to why it happened.I was once given medication, which was supposed to control it all, but found it got so bad that this had to be stopped altogether, because I simply could not wake up, and in the end tried to climb out of a bedroom window to get away from this bad horror. Luckily for me, the windows were locked, because I was in a hotel and our room was on the third floor.However, I understand that people who have this form of dementia struggle with some medications, so they are only used as short trials.I recently had a very bad night which shook me rigid afterwardwhen I looked back at it.It had been a very bad night and I can remember getting out of bed on two or three occasions, and sat in the room next door until I felt safe to return to bed. However each time I returned to bed the same horror started all over again.Eventually, I did wake up and went to have a cup of tea, at which point it dawned on me, that I had never actually left the bed during the night, I had only dreamt I had, which accounted for the nightmares going on so long.I was then so shocked about this that the next night, I did not want to go to bed, because I kept thinking, what if I thought I had woken up and had gone to the toilet? The embarrassment would have been too much for me. So these days I live in fear of these nights, and what may or may not happen.On some occasions I do get up and go downstairs to write things for my blog, just to try to concentrate on something for a while, but I am nervous about waking someone else up, so I don't do it every night.Like many people who are living with Parkinson's/ Lewy Body dementia problems, I suffer from nightly horrors and very graphic nightmares which can be very stressfulLast year my consultant put me on a new drug, which it was hoped would help cut down these horrors, and for a while, it worked, but over the last few weeks, it has started all over again.These started a few years ago when I was diagnosed as having a form of Lewy Body Dementia / Parkinsonism. The problem is that you act these graphic nightmares out, and can remember them in great detail during the next day, something which is quite frightening.Nurses in hospitals etc are told to speak quietly and touch the person going through these, in the hope of bringing them out of this, but as I pointed out to graduate nurses while giving a presentation last year, this can be highly dangerous to anyone trying to help.My wife has found out at times, that is hazardous, because she can become part of the nightmare, and then get hurt in the process, and she has a good idea what it's like, as she has become part of this when she gets too close.My wife tried this one night and ended up with a nasty black eye and bruises after one nightly horror show, and that was upsetting for me, as well as for her.Having totally demolished two bedside lights and other things, there is now nothing important next to my side of the bed.After seeing the damage after a bad night, it brings you down to earth a littleBut I could describe everything in great detail, when I wake up, which is not nice.I understand that I lash out and kick out, once these things start.There seems to be no reason for these, as many of them bare no links to reality, and that makes life hard to work out.Last year my consultant gave me a trial of some medication, in the hope that it would help, which it did for a while then the horrors started all over again a few weeks ago.After a nightmare, if I am lucky enough to wake up on my own, I usually get up, and either sit in the bathroom or go downstairs for a while, if I am not feeling wobbly.However sometimes, these things start off all over again from where they had stopped, and that is terrifyingI think part of the problem is that when I wake up, I cannot tell the difference between the nightmare or reality, and it seems to take a while to settle down.A few years ago after a flood-damaged our home we were moved into a small flat, and one night I had the worst night I had ever had.I was convinced that I had woken up from a nightmare and had gone into the sitting room, had a cup of tea, and had then gone to the toilet. This happened three times, then I eventually woke up and realized that it was all part of the nightmare.My wife said I woke up in a total panicAlthough there was no damage at all, this shook me rigid because I was convinced that I had been up three times, and had gone to the toilet.I confess that I am absolutely terrified of ever being sent into a hospital, because I have no control over what happens during these nights, and the last thing I want is to be charged with assaulting a nurse or anyone else, while I am going through a night like this.Although things are not as bad as they used to be, it's still difficult to understand.I often wake up in the morning feeling very tired and sometimes ache, I guess because of the lashing out.While it's difficult for me it must be worse for my wife, because it means that she must keep her distance while trying to wake me upWhen this all started, I thought that I was going mad, but I understand that it's all part of the Lewy Body Dementia.Perhaps it also accounts for my deep sleeping during the day.",

I have also wanted to get out of bed during the night to visit the bathroom, and have never been very sure that I actually got out of bed until I hit the wall in the bathroom to make sure I am there.Sometimes if I wake from the vivid nightmares, I get out of bed and sit in a chair, but these sometimes start all over again when I go back to bed.One night it all came to a head when I tried to escape from the nightmare by climbing out of the bedroom window, but my wife woke up just in time, as we were in a hotel and on the third floor. I suppose the lucky part of that night was the fact that the window would only open about 3 inches, and it\u2019s was the sound of me trying to force it that woke my wife up.On another night I was standing in the corner trying to get away from the horror, and as explained before I could describe it all to my wife when I settled down later in the day.This is all very distressing when it happens and there are times when I really don\u2019t want to either go to bed or go to sleep because it sometimes terrifies me of what may become.I know that it\u2019s all part of my illness, but to be honest it still does not help.There is a medication that helps but mine was reduced as I just could not wake up at all and that was disastrous for me.On one such event, I remember thinking that I had got out of bed on three occasions, and each time I went back to sleep the same nightmare started again. It was only when I finally woke up that I realised, that this was the first time I had woken up, and the rest of the time I only dreamt, that I hadwoken up and got out of bed? But this was so graphic that it was difficult to understand just what happened.This worries me as I wonder how many people have heart attacks during these dreams which are so nasty you simply can not break free of them.I have also found it very hard at times, to work out just what is reality and what is just imagination.I often find myself in a toilet during the day or night and end up hitting the wall, to make sure I am where my brain tells me I am. This often ends up with me having a very sore hand the next day.This must be one of the most distressing illnesses there is, as it's difficult to make a clear cut between reality and fiction.Many people have said onoccasions, that when someone is having a very bad night, the carer should sit close and speak to the person. This is something both my wife and I will tell you is not a good idea, as you then become part of that bad dream and can end up being hurt.In this case, my wife ended up with a black eye, which was very sad and distressing for me.This comes back to the point where at nights it is very difficult toseparatethe horrible dreams from reality, We all dream at night, but in the morning the detail can be very sketchy, but since my diagnosis, or just before it started I have been able to remember the worst nightmares in great detail, andoccasionallywrite them down in the hope that they have some bearing on life, but in reality, there isnothing at all, as these things have no bearing at all on my life or family they are totally weird",

Many simply won\u2019t have a bell because it\u2019s not manly to have a bell on your bike. But these people simply don\u2019t care about anyone but them selves.Electric cars are also a hazard because there is no noise to puck up on.To many like myself even a simple footpath is an accident waiting to happen when it comes to all of these things. When I was working it was illegal to cycle on a footpath, but now it\u2019s the done thing.Like many people I would love to get rid of background noise, but I do wonder what this would do as far as electric vehicles etc would do, would it be more hazardous, or would my hearing pick up these noises a lot better.",

This is because I wear glasses and hearing aids, and trying to remove a face mask, without pulling these off is becoming a nightmare. I have come close to losing my hearing aids and dropping my glasses, simply because I cannot workout how to do it all safely.Once the mask is on, it seems to get tangled up with both hearing aids and glasses, so they all come off in one go.

I used to love wood turning until it became too dangerous to carry on doing. Even with the emergency stop buttons, I simply tried to stop the machine in other ways, often ending up with injuries. So my son took it apart to stop me using it.  It was sad, but I realised that it was needed to stop me hurting myself badly During this time I used to love photography, a relaxing hobby, and something I really enjoyed doing. However this became difficult when I started to forget the settings. I always loved the manual settings, but realised that I had to forget that and move to automatic settings. Been that can be hard on the wrong day, but that\u2019s life. On the odd days I would carry a camera around with me, but would just not be able to set it up, this would lead to me getting upset and depressed, but I knew the next day, things my be different and they may work, so it was a case of trying to keep going.  A friend of mine was the same, and got close to giving up but was advised to try an exhibition. This was set up for him and the response was amazing. The reason being that people with dementia look at topics in different ways to professionals, who need everything in the correct place. This proved a point to me so I carried on. It\u2019s my view that we all look for different things in a photograph, and it\u2019s down to your own view, and no one else\u2019s.  I guess it\u2019s a bit like art, some people like traditional art, while others like modern art etc.  A few years ago I was at a dementia meeting, and a local artist came in with some pictures which were very modern. I vaguely remember looking and thinking something like, what on earth is that.  After a while people started looking at them and then commenting about them, things like I can see a door or window. After looking again I too could see these things, so I guess it\u2019s what your eyes can see in everything. Never judge a book by its cover comes to mind. ",

I got to the stage where my legs were giving way, so my wife suggested that we went out early, so we could get round our local park which is 500 yards away.  But that is difficult at times because of runners and cyclists who will not keep their distance from everyone else. These people are all young 20-30 year olds who don\u2019t seem to care about anyone else. Many of these people spread out across the footpath, and will not move to allow you to pass. I have a walking stick, for my balance, but they even ignore this, and barge through. In the first lockdown in March people seemed to have more respect, but that seems to have gone out of the window now, but I guess this is because we have a Prime Minister, who does not have a clue, and seems to be ignoring the scientists. However we changed our routes and things went well until the snow and ice arrived, so we had to stay in.

Trying to stay fit and active also helps keep my brain going, and although it\u2019s difficult at times, it does help. It would be so easy to sit down and give up, but I have a strong  willed wife, and daughter who rings up and keeps me on my toes.  As a Biologist she understands the body etc and will not let me give up. ",

        "content": "Over the years carers of people with any illness, especially dementia, have had a raw deal from the British Government, and many people say that carers are being left to get on with their role, with out any support or care from social services or officials within the GovernmentThis is something that we all think is wrong because carers are doing an unpaid job which they did not sign up for, neither were they given any training. Caring does not stop when the carers allowance stops, it carry\u2019s on until the person with the illness either goes into a care home or dies.Having said that, once you reach the age of 65 the carers allowance stops, so what is wrong with this Government, or any other Government who stops supporting carers at this age, apart from the obvious fact that they simply don\u2019t care about anyone but themselves. This also has a knock on effect with the Corona Virus vaccination where those who are not on allowances or benefits, do not get the vaccination until much later, yet we have to stay at home while they do the shopping.It appears that family doctors are ignoring the carers over 65, because here again they don\u2019t care less. But these people support us 24 hours of the day, and have to do their own shopping. Because we simply cannot rely on supermarkets delivering food which is well inside its sell by date.I say this because, these shops send out food which is out of date or lasts two days before it\u2019s out of date. This proves that these company\u2019s in the U.K. simply don\u2019t care about those who need to stay at home, as long as they get the money.It\u2019s amazing to think that these carers save this Government millions of pounds a year, yet they treat them with utter contemptCarers are our rock, and without their constant support and care we would be in real trouble, and that would have extra costs all round.",

The first lockdown made people think and be more caring about others, but this time round, it feels as if no one cares.Seeing all of the reports of full hospitals through the virus and all of the deaths, I would have thought that people would have started to realise just how bad things have become, but it appears that many simply don\u2019t care, it\u2019s as if everyone else will catch the virus, \u201cbut not them\u201d.There is also a rise in illegal raves and party\u2019s which involve hundreds of people, who simply don\u2019t want to conform with regulation, but I think this is because we don\u2019t have enough police in this country and the fines are far too low. The Isle of Man arrested people like this and put them in prison and now they are free of the virus, yet we seem unable to listen to the scientists here who wanted the borders closed, and longer lock downs,I had my vaccination on Saturday, although my wife is not getting hers for a few weeks or so. It\u2019s a start, but I guess it\u2019s going to be the summer at least before we see any improvements to this horror we are living through.However W have the most incompetent Government in the U.K., where they refused to close our borders thereby allowing people to bring the South African variant of the virus, ad this is now causing extra problems. We had enough problem when people in early twenty\u2019s etc, decided to do there own thing and ignore the rules, so they were spreading the virus around the country.We are also seeing a rise in people denying that there is a corona virus in this country, and a rise in hatred being spread by far right organisations.I don\u2019t understand anyone saying that the virus doesn\u2019t exist, because there have been so many deaths through it. But I think this country turned nasty during the Brexit elections, with racism, and the nastiness has continued, so it\u2019s carrying on with the virus.It\u2019s time for the Government to man up and change this country back to where it was 10 years ago, stop the racist people from causing problems etc, then we might all get our lives back again.",

Even my daughter has picked this up over the telephone, and I am getting to the stage where I am frightened of upsetting her, or anyone else.So much so that I told my wife that I don\u2019t want to be involved with telephone calls any more, in case I say something which will cause trouble.This has been going on long before this virus, and usually happened when a chest infection was brewing, but I just don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s happening now. I think my wife is frightened to tell the doctors, in case I get put in a care home etc.While I can understand this, I think I would just give up if I was in a care home, because it\u2019s not in my own zone.I think a lot of this is caused by the restrictions caused by COVID, and the fact that out local park is overrun by people driving here from other places, so they can run etc, but they are not keeping their distance from others.Coupled with this I am struggling to cope with a face mask, and struggle to understand what people are saying when they are wearing a mask. Along with this I cannot wear my hearing aids, because when I remove my mask it brings my hearing aids out, as well as my glasses.Perhaps to many people this is nothing, but when your brain does it\u2019s own thing, life becomes very difficult, I guess because we are out of our comfort zone.I have also been struggling with bowel problems since early October, and this is causing extra stress going to the toilet 4-5 times a day, and sometimes during the night, not knowing if I will get there in time.I am having tests, but found that since i came off dairy products life has become more bearable. However the consultant seems to have other ideas, and unlike our doctor who seems pleased that we have worked something out, I feel the consultant will be less forgiving.Only time will tell",

Luckily for me, the windows only opened so far, so I never got outA friend of mine who lived with the same illness thought his dreams bore a resemblance to pictures of Terry Pratchett's books, and I agreed with some of this.After a nightmare, if I am lucky enough to wake up on my own, I usually get up, and either sit in the bathroom or go downstairs for a while, if I am not feeling wobbly.However sometimes, these things start off all over again from where they had stopped, and that is terrifyingI think part of the problem is that when I wake up, I cannot tell the difference between the nightmare or reality, and it seems to take a while to settle down.A few years ago after a flood-damaged our home we were moved into a small flat, and one night I had the worst night I had ever had.I was convinced that I had woken up from a nightmare and had gone into the sitting room, had a cup of tea, and had then gone to the toilet. This happened three times, then I eventually woke up and realised that it was all part of the nightmare.My wife said I woke up in a total panicAlthough there was no damage at all, this shook me rigid because I was convinced that I had been up three times, and had gone to the toilet.Having totally demolished two bedside lights and other things, there is now nothing important next to my side of the bed.After seeing the damage after a bad night, it brings you down to earth a littleBut I could describe everything in great detail, when I wake up, which is not nice.I confess that I am absolutely terrified of ever being sent into a hospital, because I have no control over what happens during these nights, and the last thing I want is to be charged with assaulting a nurse or anyone else, while I am going through a night like this.Although things are not as bad as they used to be, it's still difficult to understand.I often wake up in the morning feeling very tired and sometimes ache, I guess because of the lashing out.While it's difficult for me it must be worse for my wife, because it means that she must keep her distance while trying to wake me upWhen this all started, I thought that I was going mad, but I understand that it's all part of the Lewy Body Dementia.Perhaps it also accounts for my deep sleeping during the day.",

        "content": "Life can be very difficult at times when you are trying to process or understand what is happening around you. I stopped going to meetings etc, because it took so long to understand and process, what was being said, and by the time I understood what had been said, it was too late to answer.The same thing happens when I'm outside and I meet friends or colleagues, and sometimes misunderstand what they have said.This can be embarrassing or can cause problems, because they may think that I am being rude. Many friends and colleagues accept that I have an illness, and take me as I am, and if I make a mistake, they don't take offense, but not everyone is as understanding these days, and far too many take it the wrong way without thinking or taking onboard my problems.This is not intended, it's just a fact of life these days, and although upsetting, I have to accept it and move, on hoping that they understood my problem.However it's not just the spoken word, it also happens with technology, my brain does not cope easily with modern technology.Many people expect me to cope with games and gadgets on things like Facebook etc, when in fact, I simply don't always understand them all, and this is frustrating, not just for me, but I guess for others too. This is also one reason why I don't play board games these days, because I need more time to process things, and people get annoyed and frustrated which does not help me, or them This is i gather all down to my slow processing due to problems in my brain, although upsetting at times, I have to accept it, hoping that others will allow me time to process the information and answer in my own time. In this fast-moving world, people don't always allow us time to take on board what has been said, or what is happening, and then start to answer themselves, which in many ways is rude and patronizing. There are times when I struggle when I'm shopping because I need to take on board what is happening around me, and that's not always easy, because people move so fast in all directions and speeds.This, in turn, leads to balance problems, because I tend to feel unsteady, or lose my balance if someone walks in front of me, and that can make people assume I am drunk when it's all down to balance processing the information in front of me. There are times when this causes problems when I'm at the doctor's because I need to take on board what has been said by the doctor before I answer, but this is why my wife always comes with me, so she can answer questions I may get stuck with, My wife has said that it may look as if I don't want to answer the questions myself, when in fact it's all down to my processing speed or lack of it. In fact, being at the doctors can be very distressing these days, because I have to remember why i am there, and anything that's gone wrong, which is not always easy, especially when it comes to explaining them properly and clearly Another problem these days is the fact that I can't answer a simple question straight away, and need time to consider what has been said before I answer. I recently had a problem with a telephone call from a consultant, who was asking about my stomach and bowel problems.I had just had a scan, so he said I did not have cancer, something which I had not considered, because I have had diverticulitis for years only its got very bad these days, so I need to be close to a toilet most of the day as I am going sometimes 4-5 times a day, and sometimes during the night. It feels as if my body is not processing food properly, and its going straight throughHowever after saying I did not have cancer, he seemed to lose interest in anything else, and I confess that I got confused and could not remember what I had already said.These people simply do not understand how bad it is to remember things like symptoms, when your brain is struggling to cope.I had notes written down for the consultant, but when I was caught out I forgot where the notes were.I know this also causes problems at home, and my wife must get very agitated with my lack of response. Simple questions can cause problems at times, and it must upset my wife along with other people There simply isn't anything I can do about it, I just have to think things through carefully and then answer. I have been caught out many times when someone has asked me a question, and I've answered wrongly, simply because I picked the question up the wrong way, I thought it meant something else.Usually, if my wife is there, she will support and correct me, and that in some way does help out, although it's upsetting to know that I've made possibly a bad mistake. It also annoys me to understand that I occasionally need someone to correct or support me. Things that used to be simple while I was working, like reading letters and emails, now cause problems, and I usually let my wife read them, before I go anywhere near to answering them, because I sometimes misunderstand what they are about, or what they are asking.However loud music can also cause extra problems these days due to him the fact that I seem to have acute hearing problems. Shopping is a complete hazard these days, due to the fact that most shops seem to have loud music blasting out all of the time. It's things like this that make me feel that I am starting to lose control of my life. ",

        "content": "Dementia and the spiritual needs of the person with the illnessWhen I was first approached to do this talk, I had looked at the title quite a few times, as it is a subject which to me is very difficult to put into words, especially when you are living with dementia.For inspiration Ilooked on the internet to try to get some answers to a subject which, in some cases causes a lot of upset.However I must point out that this is my own version of what this topic means, and it should never be assumed that everyone else is the same.There are over 120 variations of this illness, and no two people are the same. We are all individuals, on individual journeys, and therefore each person\u2019s spirituality is totally different.But here we go and I hope I get it right.Spirituality, leads to a purpose in life, in the things we value, and what is more, gives us all \u201cHope\u201d as without it we would be lostIt\u2019s not tied to any religious belief or tradition, although culture and beliefs can play a part in spirituality, every person has their own unique experience and journeyHowever to lay people like myself Spirituality is something which can be difficult to define, and analyse, but it is generally understood to mean, feelings or beliefs related to the search for meaning and purpose in life.In this day and age it may or may not include a belief in a higher power (such as a god or several gods) or the supernatural world, as each person searches for meaning in life in their own way, but spiritual beliefs, usually bring together ideas about ourselves, our relationship with others and with the world.Religion is closely linked with spirituality, but the two words mean different things, a person may have an active spiritual life without considering themselves to be religious or being involved with a religious organization.When I was first diagnosed as having dementia, I lost my job as an engineer, a job I had held for 30 years, along with my home which went with the job, as I was on call 24 hours a day. Then a few days later my Mother died. At that time, I felt as if I was going to lose everything in life.Yet something kept me going.My \u201cFAITH\u201d and that little word \u201cHOPE\u201dWhat is more I may have dementia but I still have a good idea as to what I want from life and what I expect from others.So where do we startMost people these days are encouraged to write their life story, once they have been diagnosed with dementia, although this is better done in the early stages of the illness.This life story tells the reader whether it is a family member or a member of nursing or care staff, who we are, and where we came from, what we did in life, who we married, and who our grandchildren are.It should also take in things like, what we enjoyed in life, including our religion, if in deed we are religious, our hobbies and things we get so much pleasure out of.Howevermy own life story took off and took on epic proportions, as the gates opened and the memories flooded back, usually at times when I could not write them down.But staff and carersmay learn from this, that the person loved spending quiet time outdoors, visiting gardens, etc. In this situation, the care provider should work hard to facilitate access, to this type of environment.Only with time can care staff come to understand what a person is trying to say and to grasp the expressions \u2013 so often non-verbal \u2013 that have a possible spiritual meaning. This includes encouraging care staff to take an interest in the life story of the person with dementia, and make links to possible spiritual needs.However as the brain disease progresses, we are unable to do many of the things we loved doing, before the illness started, and this in turn changes the way we see things and changes things like our taste.This story should take on board the changes we come across after the diagnosis, and many people forget this, simply don\u2019t understand it, or put it down to the person with the illness being awkward.To many around us it may seem as if we are trying to change the rules, but it\u2019s our brain which has changed, and that on its own is very frightening to us when we realise, what is happening to us.How many times have you heard a carer or fairly member say that the person with dementia has stopped eating certain foods, or does not want to do something they have done for years prior to the illness?Many think we are being stubborn or awkward, but it could be down to the changes in our brainsYet there could be a very good reason for that as I noticed, and it was a shock, when the changes were noticed.I was always what some could call old fashioned in what I ate, if we went to a Chinese restaurant, I would never ever, eat a curry but would have a steak.These days, I could eat anything including Chinese and Indian Curries, every day without being tired of it, that\u2019s if I was given the chance, what is more, the hotter and spicy they are the better.So what happened after the diagnosis to allow these changes to occur, I simply don\u2019t know, but my taste in food has changed completely?However some people have been known to revert back to foods they ate as children and that could be a shock to family members alone including our loved ones who are acting as our carers.My tastes in music have changed completely too, as before I was happy listening to classical music and some pop music, but now like many of my friends with dementia, I like rock music like Freddy Mercury and Queen, along with other artists like Eric Clapton? Very StrangeMy political views seem to have changed too which to me was a total shock, but it\u2019s safer not to go into that one.So if this happens it has to be taken on board, it\u2019s simply not good enough to say that the person has always liked this and that\u2019s what they will have or do.In many ways I am not the same person that my wife married in the 1970s, and I am not alone, once this illness gets you.Before this illness I could never stand up and speak, the mere though used to make me shake with fear, and that was before I got anywhere near to standing up, now I spend a lot of time giving talks, so am I the same person that I was before the diagnosis, certainly notHowever one thing which has never changed is this.I love watching nature; I love animals and birds etc., and delight in watching all creatures in world today. However it is vital to find out more about the unique individual who has dementia, and about their preferences, and then find ways in which the person can be spiritually nourished.I also like photography, although my use of the camera settings is very, hit and miss, these days, but the results can be interesting, as a friend with dementia living in Scotland said once.He was very good at one stage, and now through his insight into dementia, he has been able to show established photographers that people with dementia see life in a vastly different way to the rest of the world. This gentleman now has photographic exhibitions in Scotland.However there are many misconceptions about Dementia.That this illness is age related?So what about the thousands of people under the age of 65 who have a diagnosis of dementiaThere well over 16,000 people under the age of 65 who have this illness, some in their 30s.People with dementia cannot speak, or take an active part?People with dementia are unable to get involvedThese are all things which help keep this horrible stigma which is attached to dementia alive.How wrong can they be, and perhaps this is why many places, care homes, religious places, etc. are not encouraged to make things easier for us to get involvedPlease remember that these people may not say a lot, but their actions speak volumes.I always remember seeing people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease at meetings, they rarely said much, perhaps due to pressure of getting things right in their minds.In some cases their wives or family spoke up for them, without thinking and allowing the person time to speak for themselves.But their actions did all of the answering, nodding, smiling or giving a thumbs up in agreement, or shaking their heads or hands when they disagreed.They still had feelings, ideas, of what was happening, and what is more they still have a sense of purpose and the meaning of life, along with that small word with a big meaning HOPE.This has always stuck in my memory, and proved that they knew exactly what was being said, even though they could not speak.A good quality of life is something we allcherish, and this should be encouraged among those who have this illness, and those who care for us.I used to get a lot of pleasure going to church until this illness started, then I found that I could not remember the Lord\u2019s Prayer, something which was horrifying at the time.So I changed services at the church where we lived in Oxford, as it was much quieter, which allowed me to think, and it was more personalI had been a Christian all of my life with a strong belief, although I was not a regular attender at church because I was on call 24 hours a day, and did not want the pager to go off in the service.Eventually after losing my job, we moved back to the family home in North East, where I was re-diagnosed, as the first hospital had lost my notes within those three months.I was given medication which allowed me to think a bit clearer, and after a while I started to remember most of the words, which was marvelous, until I started to go back to the church I was brought up in.It was then that I realised that the words I had learnt, bore no resemblance to the service, as they used a different format at each service, and what was worse, was the fact that they had started to sing it rather than say it.I suppose the main thing to remember is that, although I was used to being able to understand many big words at work, old and new, I don\u2019t always know what they mean these days, so many words used in services these days don\u2019t mean a lotMy main problem was that I had lost the ability to sing and read words when I was in church etc., and I also had problems singing hymns and psalms, as I took time to remember the tune, but could not tie the tunes to the words, and even today I still struggle. Yet each service was vastly different and there seemed to be so many variations of things like the Lord\u2019s Prayer that I started to wonder what was going on, as this was making my life difficult to keep up with.I also have problems with my hearing which at times is acute, and this meant that I could hear other people talking most of the way through the service when I was trying to concentrate, so I was missing large parts of the service.Not so many years ago, people would have had more respect and would have remained quiet, so that others could hear what was going on. But that is now gone and no matter where you are, there is always someone else trying to get their point across, rather than let people listen to the speaker. These days life is made harder by the mobile phones, which always seem to go off when you are thinkingThis acute hearingis so bad at times that I can hear a conversation at the other end of a railway carriage, but struggle to hear what is said by the person sat next to me. Some may say that this is selective hearing, but it\u2019s very distressing at times because I don\u2019t wish to hear what other people were doing last night, as it\u2019s embarrassing.I have also lost the ability to understand things like messages and e-mails, which was distressing, yet how many people would understand my dilemma. I sometimes read them three or four times, and this usually gives me a different answer each time, so in the end I have to ask my wife what it means.We also see so many variations of each copy of books like the bible, many written in modern day language, and this all adds to confusion, when you have an illness like dementia.However these days, I do feel that many religions including the \"Church of England\u201d are trying hard to attract youngsters into the church at the expense of the elderly and those who have dementia, and I find that very upsetting as to many people with dementia their religion means so muchThey are the elderly and those with neurological illness. However I do feel that churches etc., should take on board that, the older generation were taught these forms of service when we were young, and these constant changes help no one.Some Clergy seem to think that those in the care homes don't sing or say their prayers so why bother?So when these priests go to care homes, they find that those with memory problems do not know the words and loose interest, however Lay people who use traditional Lord\u2019s Prayer and Psalms get responses.So do these people really know why people with dementia and memory problems, are in care homes, and what is more important do they understand the basics of our illness.I did think this was because they had forgotten one major factor, and that is people, as they get older and those with early onset dementia, remember the services they were taught either in church, chapel or at school assemblies.They should also remember that we don\u2019t want long winded sermons, because we all lose interest, but make it short and to the point, and use the scriptures where needed.As our old Canon used to say, you need to get your sermon through clearly to the congregation in 10 Minutes, in a way they can understand it. I think this is the same for most things these days, don\u2019t confuse us with too much; make it short and to the point.However one day in sheer desperation I sat down, and after many days, I had written a letter to a Bishop explaining the problems associated with neurological illness and changes to church services, included also was my problem of sleep patterns.I did this because I was misguided enough to believe that a Bishop would be sympathetic and understanding, but what I shock I got when I got his response. He more or less told me to get up on a Sunday morning, and go to 8am Communion, where they used the Book of Common Prayer, and I would haveno further problems.He obviously did not take on board that I have sleep problems with very graphic and distressing nightmares, which can go on for over an hour and some nights more, and then usually go into a deep sleep around 5am as I had told him.This made me understand that many in society do not understand dementia so we must make allowances for them even though it can be hurtful, but through perseverance we will educate them all about the illness in timeBut life as we know it changes when you get this diagnosisWhen a person receives a diagnosis of dementia their spiritual and religious beliefs may be shaken or even lost, as the person asks, \u2018why me\u2019, what have I done to deserve this illness, and carers should be alert to this possibility.On the other hand some people with dementia and their carers may develop a new or renewed interest in faith and religious practices, when they are faced with crisis.Hope can bring meaning in a person\u2019s life and help them face difficult times without despair.It is future orientated, and experiencing hope, provides strength to cope with painful and stressful events, such as receiving a diagnosis of dementia.Many of us, live in hope that the medication, we may be taking may help improve our condition or even cure us.Many like myself have prayed for a cure, and this helps us to hang on to our beliefsFinding hope is a means of coping with this illness, and what is happening to our lives, and professionals need to be aware that even when hope is unrealistic, people must find their own way to make their own meaning.However not everyone can speak, so we have to make allowances for everyone.Most people with this illness also feel very isolated and alone at times, even when we have family around us, but this is because we cannot explain ourselves at times, or get the right words out and this is distressing.Sometimes my brain goes blank and I cannot think about anything clearly.Sometimes the words just flow but in the wrong order, and that puts a different meaning on what we were trying to say.Some people like myself panic when being asked a question on the spur of the moment and the wrong words flow.I was once accused of being angry when I was asked a question, but that was totally wrong. I just went into panic mode and said what I thought was right, but I was wrong.So please allow us time to think slowly before answering your questions, and never answer your own questions, as that is very rude and patronising.Spatial awareness also plays a major part in each of our lives, and must be remembered, so please respect that because things can go wrong if you get too close at the wrong time. Sometimes we just need a little bit of time in our own area, without anyone coming in and disturbing us, and this is our comfort zone.Nightmares are horrific and sometimes difficult to wake up from. If you see anyone having one of these, please talk quietly to the person but never get too close because otherwise, you could become a part of that nightmare and end up being hurt, as my wife once found to her horrorI do think these days that life moves far too fast for those with this illness and it\u2019s difficult to keep up, especially when you have fixed ideas in your brain.As well as that many people simply don\u2019t understand this illness and just push it to one side, so we must now change people\u2019s attitudes and views on dementia then we will certainly become a dementia friendly society. We are getting there, but it needs a bigger push to get most if not all of society onboard.Through all of this I have realised that those of us with this illness, struggle to keep up with what is a very fast life these days, and as a friend in Indonesia says,It seems like a swan going up stream in a river, on the surface it seems to be keeping up with the water, but under the water, its legs are going flat out to keep up.In other words we all look normal on the outside, but our brains are going flat out to keep up with what is happening around us on a daily basis.But please rememberWe still have feelings, ideas, of what was happening, and what is more they still have a sense of purpose and the meaning of life, along with that small word with a big meaning\u201cHOPE\u201d",

I know that I have hit the bottom a few times, and its not easy trying to cope.I guess its because I feel like a caged bird and don't know how to cope with everything that's going on around me, because its all so very different, so its not in my comfort zone.But having said that, the government keep changing the rules every week, and no one seems to understand what they are doing.I do think that people with dementia are being ignored and left to find their own way, which is totally different to the last session.When we last had quarantine quide lines where everyone knew what they were allowed to do , and what not to do, it was so different, but slightly helpful.People living with any form of dementia, have no guide book to work from, so when your brain does its own thing, and its a case of trial and error. As I have said before, I feel as if I am no longer in charge of my brain, its doing its own thing all of the time.The thought of going back into yet another lockdown did not appeal at all, and its a bit frightening, as many people are ignoring the rules.I am also struggling to cope with my sleeping problems at present, as my graphic dreams and nightmares are back, and its frightened my wife on a few occasions, because she has to cope with the nighly horrors, and if she tries to help, she then becomes part of the horror.Last week I was close to tears, as I had hit my wife a few times during one nightly session, and I find this very unnerving to cope with, especially when I have no idea that I have done anything.I know that I have anger issues these days, and this too is frightening because I have no idea what is causing it.Whether this is all linked to the constant news about the virus or the illness, i have no real idea, but its very distressing.I don't always listen to the national news because its all about the virus, where the local news is different on ITV.",

Both my GP and Respiratory nurse said that i had to wear one, and its been very hard, but I need to be active so its got to be done if I want to go into a shop.As well as this, I found that even though I have breathing problems, and struggle to wear a mask, I was getting too much abuse when I went out shopping without a face mask.

Luckily for me the person saying this, has a lot of experience as her daughter has the same problems.I don't feel as if I have this horror, but these days you can never tell as this Government keep changing the symptoms etc, all of the time. But hopefully I will get the pass results on Friday.I was sent home with some very strong antibiotics, which killed the chest infection last year, so hopefully they will work again, although they seem to hammer the body in the process.The last infection I had in June seemed to give me more thought processing problems, similar to those I vaguley remember after I had viral pnumonia in 2001. I had problems finding my way to work, and could not remember my computer passwords etc, then lost the ability to remember my electrical training, and that finally finished my job as an engineer.I found that to be frightening, and this last episode was very similar, and I guess that's why my wife pushed me into seeing a doctor as a precaution.My memory is bad enough these days with getting infections like thisSince I have Bronchiectasis and Emphysema, I have been checking my oxygen levels at home since this virus started in March, but over the last few weeks, I noticed a drop which was a little frightening, so that was another reason to see a professional.I also have something called an Heamphilis influenza bug living in the bottom of my lungs, and its this which causes so much trouble as it cannot be killed off.As my dear daughter has said on many occasions, I need hanging upside down by my feet so that my lungs can drain out. I know she is only kidding, but this does get distressing at times trying to remove the rubbish so I can breathe properly again. I have exercises for this, but they don't always work.I have not been on social media very much during the last two months simply because I am terrified of writing the wrong things, or misunderstanding what I am looking at.He tiredness is terrible and can drop off to sleep at anytime, i guess I have never known anything like this before, and sometimes its very hard to stay awake.I only go out for short walks round our local park and this is usually when its very quiet, which is not far from our front door, and this keeps my legs going and also means I am getting some fresh air away from the woodburning stoves in our area.Friday cannot come fast enough now so that I know what I am up against, I just want to get my walks back again.",

The Bronchiectatsis was something that developed when I was a child, after a bout of whooping cough, measles and mumps. That I guess wrecked my lungs without anyone knowing, and that was made worse by a life working in industry.Life is interesting and certainly not boring, but I guess the one thing that upsets me is when doctors etc, ask if I am stressed or depressed, yes I get stressed, when I don't remember how to do things, or I feel rough and can't get out for a walk etc, but that's not depression and these people cannot accept thisHowever these chest infections cause many other problems, which have an effect on my memory etc. Like the pneumonia I had around 1990 this one has had an effect on my emotions, thoughts and memory etc, and it's been an uphill struggle to keep going. I guess it's because I feel so shattered, dropping off to sleep quite a lot, and unable to think clearly.This was highlighted last week when I saw a money raising idea for charity, on facebook, and after looking for my favourite charity, the Lewy Body Society, I found that I had started the thing going without realising what I had done.In some ways I am pleased to help raise money, but this gave me a big shock, however it seems to be doing alright.Both my wife and daughter, say they know when things are building up like infections, by the change in me. I understand that I get very tired and sleep a lot, but also irritable, because I dont see or understand fully what is happening at times.It's cut my activities down and I have to take it easy for another week at least. But I am back on gentle exercise again so that will help to get me going again.I am a terrible patient at the best of times, and struggled the last time I was ill in hospital but at home I can at least do odd things without getting into trouble.I am hoping that my spelling is alright, as it's taken my three days to work this out.",

A study from Washington University St Louis outlines thebenefits of the test, which has a 94 per cent accuracy rate.Early Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis is vital to combat thecondition, because there\u2019s currently no cure, and treatments can delay onset.Most people are not tested for the disease until symptoms, such as memory loss,start to occur and by then the condition already has a hold on the brain.Early detection could mean many extra years with goodquality of life, and the individual retaining their independence for a lotlonger. At present, the average life expectancy after Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis isjust four to eight years.The progression of the disease can vary between cases, withsome relatives seeing parents and grandparents slowly deteriorating. In others,the rate at which they become confused, isolated and scared is much moredramatic.It\u2019s widely accepted that there are seven stages ofAlzheimer\u2019s, starting with no clinical impairment right through to very severecognitive decline. Most diagnoses occur during the third phase of the diseasewhen people who know the patient very well notice changes in their loved one.Despite scientists all over the world working on a cure forAlzheimer\u2019s, the drugs on the market only slow down memory loss and reducechanges in behaviour, including agitation. Furthermore, these medications areonly useful if the condition is detected in its mild to moderate phases.While PET scans and spinal taps remain effective ways todiagnose Alzheimer\u2019s, they are very expensive and intrusive, causing a lot ofpain to the patient. This means a subjective test is usually used, whichfocuses on a number of questions directed at the individual and it is not up tothe level of detail required.The new blood test, which has been developed by Dr SuzanneSchindler and her team at Washington University St Louis, could be an effectiveand cheap method of diagnosis. Using the test alone, it matched the PET scan ofplaques in the brain 88 per cent of the time, but once genetic tests forAlzheimer\u2019s were taken into account, the accuracy reached 94 per cent.In terms of what this could mean in the development of acure, Dr Schindler said earlier detection of plaques could \u201cspeed up theprocess so we can find an effective drug faster. The value of the test is inidentifying people very early in the course of the disease\u2026and essentiallyclear out amyloid, and those people theoretically would not go on to developdementia.\u201cOf course this has to be proven, but we think it mightwork. But to do this, you have to have a good test.\u201dOne in six over-80s in the UK have dementia, withAlzheimer\u2019s being the most common form. There are also 42,000 under-65s livingwith the disease. While these numbers are already substantial, they\u2019re expectedto increase in the coming years, making finding ways to effectively tackle it apressing issue.",

However, not long after our first dog settled in at home, we found out that my wife was pregnant, so our first dog Major, became our daughter \"Claires\" body guard, as he protected her from the moment she was brought home from the hospital, and not even my mother in law was allowed near to her carry cot.This was something new to me as I had never heard of animals being so protective like this ever before. Major had not seen claire before, but for some reason, he instantly took up his role as her protector. After our son Mark was born, the same thing happened again, and he protected us all in more ways than one, until he died of cancer.Not long after this we got another dog \"Ben\" , who was very nervous, but as I became ill we seemed to get closer, without me realising what was going on. After losing my job as an Engineer to this illness, I spent a lot of time at home, and Ben, started to follow me everywhere I went, but I never understood why until much later. Around this time I started to see things in the house, but could not understand why Ben never moved from my feet, and never seemed to notice these things. This was usually birds, flying around the house, then this changed to big \"spiders\" My wife later told me, that if Ben never moved, these things were not there, it was simply my brain playing tricks.After being finally diagnosed with Early Onset Lewy Body dementia and was put on medication we realised Ben was ill. He then died of cancer and that was very hard to cope with at the time, because there was a strong bond between us, something I did not understand at the time. Afterwards the vet told us, that he had been ill for some time, but had probably kept it hidden until I had been diagnosed , then decided it was his time to go. This made life do much harder, to understand at the time. However this proves that animals are much more understanding, and in some cases more caring than humans, because they have the ability to pick up our problems. Although Ben drove me mad at times, when he was following me around, I guess he was protecting and watching over me, so in many ways he was doing something similar to a dementia/ service dog, apart from the fact he was not trained to do the job. He had his own problems with his nerves, and became a physical wreck when there was fireworks going off, so I spent time sitting on the floor holding him and trying to calm him down.I vaguely remember being called out at night to go to work, as I was on call for emergencies 24 hours a day.When I got home Ben's head would be poking out of the cat door waiting for me to return. I often wondered if someone had done something to him earlier in his life, and that was the cause if his nervous problems. However apart from that, he like Major was a lovely dog to have around. ",

Out of 2,000 peer reviewed papers published since 2008 worldwide, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) doctor and researcher, John, wrote or contributed to 86 papers on the condition.England is the world\u2019s top performing region in terms of expertise in dementia with Lewy bodies, according to the new data analysis published by Expertscape \u2013 a website which objectively ranks people and institutions by their expertise across more than 26,000 biomedical topics. The data also shows that worldwide, Cambridge is one of the top five cities contributing most into this disease area, topped by London and followed by Newcastle in second place.Professor O\u2019Brien delivers research with care as an honorary consultant old age psychiatrist at Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust and Professor of Old Age Psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge. He is the National Specialty Lead for Dementias at the National Institute for Health Research.John said: \u201cObviously I am delighted by this news, which reflects the hard work of study teams and collaborators in Newcastle and Cambridge with whom I have had the pleasure of working with over the last 10 years. The fact that my colleagues Clive Ballard (Exeter) and Dag Aarsland (King\u2019s College London) also make up the top three, with England listed top country worldwide, is a testament to the real excellence of Lewy body dementia research here in the UK.\"We will continue to build on this, and I am very grateful to all our funders, including NIHR who funded the recent DIAMOND-Lewy Programme, and to the NIHR Clinical Research Network\u2019s Dementias and Neurodegeneration specialty \u2013 who play a pivotal role in successfully delivering all our studies.\u201dStudies conducted by clinicians and researchers at CPFT, working closely with people living with dementia, have contributed to the knowledge base behind  new care guidelines released by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) last year.CPFT is a top performer in the East of England for recruitment to dementia studies. Recognising their contribution, NICE advises that all people with dementia should be provided with information on research studies they could participate in. Local residents interested in participating in dementia studies can contact the Trust\u2019s Windsor Research Unit on 01223 219531  wru@cpft.nhs.uk.John's research interests include the application of imaging biomarkers in dementia and late-life depression and he has particular expertise in Lewy body and vascular dementias.Over his career, he has published over 500 peer-reviewed scientific papers on these topics and is a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Emeritus Senior Investigator.The NIHR supports research into all areas of dementias and neurodegenerative disease. In 2018/19, the NIHR\u2019s Clinical Research Network supported the delivery of 24 clinical research studies on DLB \u2013 recruiting 5,793 patients, with the DIAMOND-Lewy study contributing significantly to the total recruitment.Find out more about research in this NIHR specialtyView the full Expertscape listing onlineNotes \u00b7 Currently it is estimated that 850,000 people in the UK are living with dementia, and the only way to find new and better ways to treat and care for those affected by the condition is to do more research. But researchers rely on people finding out about suitable studies and volunteering to take part.\u00b7 NICE recommends that health and care professionals should help people living with dementia and their carers find out about opportunities to take part in research, and empower them to make their own decisions about getting involved.\u00b7 One way to do this is to provide information about Join Dementia Research, a UK-wide service that enables people with dementia and their carers to register their interest and matches volunteers with the most appropriate studies, with no obligation.

        "content": "Over the last few years we have heard of lots of people living with dementia, having their diagnosis of dementia being changed.This is sometimes from one type of dementia, to another, or simply being told that you have not deteriorated fast enough, so the diagnosis is changed to mild cognitive impairment or something else.Being diagnosed with this illness is bad enough, but then for someone else to come along and change it again leaves a lot to be desired, especially when they think its funnyThe only change may be the term used, because more often than enough your symptoms are exactly the same, and no matter which way we look at it, there is nothing at all mild about, Mild Cognitive Impairment, if your diagnosis is changed to that.As one family doctor told us, these terms are changed by various hospitals and doctors etc, because they themselves don\u2019t understand what is going on in your brain.Another consultant told us, the only answer will come when we die and our brain can be looked at properly.Its one thing to change a diagnosis, but the damage done by this can cause a lot of problems, to those concernedSo many brain diseases appear to have very similar symptoms, that I guess it\u2019s how the diagnosis is sorted out using your symptoms at the time.In my own case, I was originally diagnosed as having Alzheimer\u2019s, then a consultant told me the I had early onset Lewy Body Dementia, which was confusing.Later on I was told by a young doctor that because I had not deteriorated fast enough she was changing my diagnosis to Mild Cognitive Impairment, at which stage, I was so upset and unsure of what was happening that I walked out of the hospital in tears.My wife then demanded a second opinion from a consultant before she followed me outsideThis was handled so badly that I felt as if I had being living a lie, something I knew was wrong, but it left me in a mess for some time.Eventually I saw a Dementia consultant, who said that he was convinced I had a slower burning type of Lewy Body Dementia, as many people don\u2019t always follow the same pathway, and it could take longer to get to the later stages.Here again he said that we would never know the answer until I died.A lot of people have said that when this happens, they feel upset and humiliated because of the way they were being dealt with at the time.I guess it\u2019s enough to push people over the top, but I was lucky that I had a supportive wife, family and family doctor who got me back on track, and never got to the wrong end of this.One dear friend has recently been told that a head injury earlier in life, could have caused problems later on which were then diagnosed as Alzheimer\u2019s. So it proves that even experts can get things wrong.I had a bad head injury years ago and woke up on the floor after falling around 15ft or so. At that point I felt as if my head had exploded, and suffered from horrific headaches for some time afterwards, but I gathered that this could not have had any bearing on my diagnosis.I then went to have episodes of epilepsy, or so we were told, then we were later told that this could have been the start of my dementia, although I was left thinking that someone had got it wrong againI guess one day we will be able to get better diagnosis procedures, which will be a great help to both consultants and patients, but we may have a long wait.I the mean time it\u2019s a case of keeping as active and busy as possible, so that our brains can remain active.Use it or Lose it",

        "content": "Originally written 2012Like many people who are living with Parkinsons/ Lewy Body dementia problems, I suffer from nightly horrors and very graphic nightmares which can be very stressfulLast year my consultant put me on a new drug, which it was hoped would help cut down these horrors, and for a while it worked, but over the last few weeks it has started all over again.These started a few years ago when I was diagnosed as having a form of Lewy Body Dementia / Parkinsonism. The problem being that you act these graphic nightmares out, and can remember them in great detail during the next day, something which is quite frightening.Nurses in hospitals etc, are told to speak quietly and touch the person going through these, in the hope of bringing them out of this, but as I pointed out to graduate nurses while giving a presentation last year, this can be highly dangerous to anyone trying to help.My wife has found out at times, that is hazardous, because she can become part of the nightmare, and then get hurt in the process, and she has a good idea what its like, as she has become part of this when she gets too close.My wife tried this one night, and ended up with a nasty black eye and bruises after one nightly horror show, and that was upsetting for me, as well as for her.Having totally demolished two bedside lights and other things, there is now nothing important next to my side of the bed.After seeing the damage after a bad night, it brings you down to earth a littleBut I could describe everything in great detail, when I wake up, which is not nice.I understand that I lash out and kick out, once these things start.There seems to be no reason for these, as many of them bare no links to reality, and that makes life hard to work out.Last year my consultant gave me a trial of some medication, in the hope that it would help, which it did for a while then the horrors started all over again a few weeks ago.After a nightmare, if I am lucky enough to wake up on my own, I usually get up, and either sit in the bathroom, or go downstairs for a while, if I am not feeling wobbly.However sometimes, these things start off all over again from where they had stopped, and that is terrifyingI think part of the problem is that when I wake up, I cannot tell the difference between the nightmare or reality, and it seems to take a while to settle down.A few years ago after a flood damaged our home we were moved into a small flat, and one night I had the worst night I had ever had.I was convinced that I had woken up from a nightmare and had gone into the sitting room, had a cup of tea, and had then gone to the toilet. This happened three times, then I eventually woke up and realised that it was all part of the nightmare.My wife said I woke up in a total panicAlthough there was no damage at all, this shook me rigid because I was convinced that I had been up three times, and had gone to the toilet.I confess that I am absolutely terrified of ever being sent into a hospital, because I have no control over what happens during these nights, and the last thing I want is to be charged with assaulting a nurse or anyone else, while I am going through a night like this.Although things are not as bad as they used to be, it's still difficult to understand.I often wake up in a morning feeling very tired and sometimes ache, I guess because of the lashing out.While it's difficult for me it must be worse for my wife, because it means that she must keep her distance while trying to wake me upWhen this all started, I thought that I was going mad, but I understand that it's all part of the Lewy Body Dementia.Perhaps it also accounts for my deep sleeping during the day.

You may not have a clue about what the word means, but like reading a book, you have to attempt to break the word up into sections in the hope of trying to say it.However trying to muddle your way through a normal day can be stressful enough, while trying to make sure that we don\u2019t do, or say the wrong thing, and I don\u2019t think people consider this when discussing this illness.People these days are not so forgiving if you say the wrong thing by mistake, or do the wrong thing.

If I am not sure, I head for the disabled toilet for safety.I think this tour was too far for me, as I struggled with the long journey, and this is frightening because we are going to the Isle of Skye at the end of the month with our church.Although the journey is about the same, the breaks for a rest are usually longer, and people are always more patient with me because many of them know me and are understandingI guess we will just have to wait and see what happens.",

I am prone to repeated chest infections, due to the fact that I have Bronchiectasis. This was something that developed when I was a child, after a bout of whooping cough, measles\u00a0 and mumps. That I guess wrecked my lungs without anyone knowing, and that was made worse by a life working in industry. Luckily for me I carry an emergency pack of antibiotics in case of emergencies, and these go with me when I go on holiday etc. Along with this, I also have the added problem, that I carry the Heamophilis influenza bug with me, something that is deep inside my lungs, and even two weeks of antibiotics does not kill it off completely So I guess life can be interesting and certainly not boring.I guess this is one thing that upsets me when doctors etc ask if I am stressed or depressed, yes I get stressed when I don't remember how to do things, or I feel rough and can't get out for a walk etc, but that's not depression and tgese people cannot accept this ",

I don't think I have ever seen so many questions like that.In dementia we get used to the memory tests, but to me this went far beyond anything I have ever had to do, and it destroyed the rest of my week, and I was not pleasant to be around, so I am toldThis hurt when I was told it, after which I said I would never do anything like that ever again.It\u2019s so sad, because without research we will not get the answers to these illnesses, but sadly it has finished me.Researchers need to be caring and understanding, when looking at this subject, but I felt that the person doing the research with me was out of her depth, because she knew nothing about the well known people with dementia, and don\u2019t think she knew much about Lewy Body Dementia.I confess that by the time I had finished this project I felt like throwing my medication away, and saying to hell with it.But I guess looking back I may well be wrong and need to think again.I have done reaserch at Newcastle University, which was tiring, but handled sensitively and that makes a vast differenceIn the future I will work with them but no one else.I had said prior to the research, that I did not wish to take part in the usual question paper looking into depression, something that many of these researchers think we all haveYet something seemed to stick in my memory, and I am convinced that I still did those questions when I was totally shattered",

        "content": "There has been a lot said recently about how to improve your memory, and a lot has also been said about natural treatments being sold which claim to cure memory problems, but this has been largely rubbished by the science researchersI do feel that before you can say that you, or anyone else can help your memory problems, you should have a good idea as to what caused it in the first place, medical condition or simply old age.A few charities believe that \"all\" memory problems are all associated with Dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, when in fact there are a number of illnesses which can have an effect in your memory.As I understand it, things like Bronchiectasis,COPD and MS etc, can cause cognitive issues, but so can other illnesses, so its wise to check up on the true cause of your problems first, and never assume something else, which could be wrong.When I was originally diagnosed with early onset Lewy Body Dementia, I was told to \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d, in other words, keep your brain active or you lose it. This consultant was trained in Lewy Body Dementia under Professor Ian McKieth at Newcastle University, and explained everything to us at the hospitalThese words have always been with me since that time, and have kept me going, because it would be far too easy to sit back and let this illness take its toll.However I do feel that before we take notice of television programmes on memory etc, we should try to work out exactly why we have memory problems and not automatically assume that it\u2019s all down to dementia.After this, find a routine to get you through the day, and include time for brain training.In my case, my memory went haywire after I had been ill with viral pneumonia, then after 6 months everything seemed to get worse, at which point I lost my job as an engineer.I also had a scan done which showed evidence of TIA's and cerebral atrophy, and my family doctor said it was certainly not age related shrinkageLooking back, I had rewired the college chaple, but now I am unable to fit a plug onto an appliance without my son checking it, to see if it\u2019s wired up correctly. To me this is upsetting, knowing that I no longer remember how to do my job.After my diagnosis I was told to remain active, and not to sit back waiting for the worst to happen.I started writing my life story as suggested by my consultant, and then started writing a blog which happened really by accident, and then found out, that it was being read all over the world, before I knew what was happeningBut I also do brain training games, jig saw puzzles, even though they are small. While these may be small, they are manageable, if I work in short spurts, and gradually build them up.I also have lots of games on my iPad which I try to do every day if I can. Although each day is different, I still try to do whatever I can, when ever Ican , in the hope of keeping my brain going.However I do feel that consultants working in the memory field, are the best at giving correct advice on treatments.Having said that, I am not sure how good memory tests are, because things tend to get repeated and that sometimes defeats the object when you have memory problems.I say this because in real life, you don't get prompts when you want to remember of try to do something. You are on your own to work it out without help or support.Having said that, i feel it would be far too easy to be conned by adverts into trying to use something which could have misleading results.Always ask the professionals in the medical field for advice firstThanks to Speech Notes for allowing me to carry on with this blog.",

Everyday we see people crossing roads etc, glued to their phone instead of watching where they are going. In some cases television presenters who are supposed to be reading\u00a0 the news, are reading what is on their Twitter account, something I consider to be very rude. However these days we're seeing a lot of racial hatred on the internet,\u00a0 something that I never expected to see. Yes there has always been racial problems of one kind or another in the world, yet these days, every time you go on the internet, you see someone racially abusing someone else, and to me it has to be stopped. Within the UK, a lot of this was wipped up by politicians etc, during the brexit vote. Since then it has escalated, and got a lot worse, so much so that I wonder where it will ever end. Politicians these days seem to blame everyone else for these problems, but if they looked closer to home they would find out who was to blame. However of the politicians, who caused the trouble during the brexit vote, are well known to be of foreign Origin, and in some cases have dual passports, something which makes you wonder what is going on.Looking back at racial hatred within the UK and the world at large, many people who assume that they are from one country or another, may find that whether they like it or not, that their ancestors were in fact immigrants at one stage in time.I myself found this out by accident, a series of blood tests found that I had a vitamin deficiency. My family doctor then explained, that this could have been caused by the fact that my ancestors came from a Mediterranean Country, or North Africa,\u00a0 somewhere in the distant past, and they are in fact could it be dark skinned. As we don't get a lot of sun in the North East of England, it has a knock on effect on my skin etc. This came as quite a shock to me, but after a while I started to understand it, and I actually laugh about it, because it was something that I never expected. I have often loved to go abroad and travel, now I am beginning to wonder if this is from my genes and foreign ancestry. I\u00a0 guess no one will never know After doing family tree research, my father is horrified to hear that he could have been Anglo-Saxon, so now I try to guess, at what you would say to this.To me it does not matter where we came from, because at the end of the day people have moved around since the very early days, and in the case of the UK, we have been invaded from the time of the Romans onwards, so who knows in reality,\u00a0 who the original people were or are these days. I honestly hope that this government gets to grips with the Brexit rubbish, and get things sorted out, so that all if this racial hatred stops, once and for all We are all human, and no matter what religion or area we are from, we should be able to get on without fighting and hatred.

It seemed that he was ill himself, although he did not show it until it was too late.I vaguely remember crying my eyes out at the vets, made much harder when the vet told us that Ben must have known he was ill, but must have hung on until I got my diagnosis and was settled, then decided it was time for him to move on.He was in many ways my guardian Angel, and protected me from the worst while I was going through the diagnosis procedure, and was my eyes, when I was not sure if something was real, or if I was hallucinatingSometimes I find the whole situation to be stressful, and have been accused of staring, when I am trying to work out what is real and what is not.It's not the first time I have seen people, who then simply disappeared, and at times like this I find the situation to be stressful.However these days we hear so much about Dogs, for those who have dementia, something I find interesting as I would never have considered it beforeDogs being used to assist those living with eyesight problems etcDogs being trained to assist other people with various medical problems.Dogs used to sniff out medical problemsA few years ago I went out with my son's dog, a rather nutty border collie, who only has three legs, but noticed that this dog, kept close to my right leg, in fact as my wife said she was acting like a stabiliser, to stop me falling over.Although I said at the time, that I could feel her pressing against my leg I was not worried, because she was doing a job that need doing.But thinking about this properly, I do feel that it is good to have animals around us, because they know what is needed and give pure love and affection 24 hours a day, in return for nothing more than being fed, watered and walked.Yes walking is good exercise, so each dog must be matched to the person with the illness, so that we don't match a powerful dog to a weak or person with balance problems.",

        "content": "November 2018Over the years I have struggled with seeing things, some of which may or may not be real.This can be upsetting to those people living with Lewy Body Dementia, but it can also be upsetting for those caring for these people, or anyone nearby who does not understand what is happening.We had a change our carpets at home, because I could often see very large spiders walking across the floor, or sometimes on the wall nearby.I was never frightened of spiders before, but these days I really struggle, because in my mind they are real, and they scare me to death.I used to throw my slipper at them, but these days, my aim is so bad I am liable to hit the television or worse, my wife.The other day I went for a walk round our local park, and saw some boys on the skate boarding ramps, or so I thought.When I got round the corner they were not there. I looked all around thinking that they had run off, but there was no sign of them anywhere, and there was no where for them to hide.There simply is no way three people can simply disappear into thin air like that, although I have had this experience before, but never understood what was going onI found this to be upsetting as I was on my own, and could not work out what was happening.This also left me feeling a little frightened, so I went home again.This was at the time I was taking codeine for my back, and I wondered after Christmas, whether it was the codeine which caused this extra problem, because it not recommended.I sometimes have to stare at things long enough to work out whether they are real or not, which is not really good, but sometimes it's my only option.A dear friend of mine, who also had Lewy Body Dementia, used to see a large green frog, but although his wife said it was not real, he would sit and talk to it on a regular basis. He called it his pet frog.Trying to understand whether something is real, or whether it's my brain playing trucks on me is very difficult to cope with.This can also cause major problems when I am crossing a road, deciding whether I am seeing a car, and if so how far away is it.I have been so close to getting run over by a car in the past, and it gets frightening, but I keep going in the hope that it all changesI guess the brain is very sensitive, but we take it for granted, until the day it stops working properly.",

        "content": "Thanks to theSpeech NotesAPPfor allowing me to start writing again, as I can talk to my tablet computer, then this sends it all direct to the blog, without the stress of thinking about what I am writingThinking about what I want to write, and putting on paper, is difficult these days, but this app has now made life so much easierMedical Profession, and the lack of knowledge about Lewy Body DementiaWe found this out the hard way, after one young dementia consultant put me on medication to help with my graphic nightmares during the night.This was started just before we went on holiday one year. But on the second night, I tried to climb out of the hotel window in the hope of breaking free from this horror. Luckily for me, the window was locked so it did not open, and we were on the third floor of the hotel.My wife woke up just in time to stop me trying to escape from the window.As I am living with Lewy Body Dementia, I have always been limited as to what medications I can take and what dose that is limited to.My wife rang the hospital the next morning and the medication was reduced and then stopped. This was because, this young hospital doctor had put me on something without checking the correct dose I could take with this illness.However, I have been amazed at how many Doctors and Consultants etc, claim to know all about Lewy Body Dementia, then do something totally stupid.They think that because they understand one type of dementia, that they know it all, but just how wrong can this beI was recently seeing a Consultant for lower back pain because we were not sure if it was connected to my osteoarthritis in my hip.After another hip injection, I was told that there was nothing that they could do, so I was referred to the pain management clinic, where I saw another specialist, and yes he knew all about Lewy Body dementia, so much so, that he tried to make my wife look silly.He told me that he was putting me on codeine, to help with the pain. This was supposed to be a low dose but said that the family doctors could raise the level when needed. As this did not help a family doctor told us to raise the level at certain times of the day.We did not know that this medication was bad for those living with this illness, and neither did heEventually, as I was in a lot of pain, my wife got me an appointment to see a chiropractor. After one visit he said that these pain-killers were very bad, and he wanted me off them. However, he soon found the cause of my problems as the pain was coming from trapped nerves in two parts of my back and also realised, that I had a major problem with my jaw which was out of line.Since seeing him in November, I am off all pain-killers and feel much better.I also had a problem with foot drop, which was ignored by the hospital, by this has now nearly gone, apart from when I get very tired.When I went back to see my Lewy Body Dementia consultant, he was horrified that I had been on Codeine, because it\u2019s not good for people with this illness, because it causes complications, but was pleased that I am now off them.We then got an appointment at our doctors, where my wife asked if the Codeine could be removed from my repeat prescription, and told them why.My wife said they looked puzzled because they knew nothing about this. but after explaining what the consultant had said, they agreed to remove it.Just after this, I saw an occupational therapist who was attached to the pain management consult, and this started all over again because she refused to believe that these tablets were bad for me, and yes she fully understood Lewy Body Dementia?All she wanted to do was put me back on them again.Needless to say that we always check before changing a prescription.It seems to be a running battle between my wife and those in the medical profession who claim to fully understand this illness, always check with your consultant before taking anything new.While doctors can not understand everything about Dementia when they leave University, I do feel Lewy Body dementia needs to be more widely taught to medical students in the future Thank goodness for the Dementia consultants who really know about this illness and its complicationsI like many people are extremely lucky to have a brilliant Lewy Body Consultant looking after me, as well a lovely support staff, but many people are not so lucky.Let us all hope that this changes for the best in the future",

Most politicians have never ever served their countryOur children and grandchildren are the ones who will suffer in the end, not these wealthy politicians who from all accounts are making a vast amount of money out of thisWe must remember that must of the elderly have worked had for all, if not most of their lives, and have paid their taxes in full, unlike today when we hear of most well off people are getting away with paying only the basic tax, and sending the rest abroad.This is the cause of most of the UK problems today, because of people banking abroad and hiding their real salaries.So please stop blaming the elderly for everything which is wrong in this country, blame the politicians",

        "content": "Written by Brenda Kelly KimIn any form of disease, the sooner a diagnosis is found, the sooner treatment can begin.Finding a health problem early is the best way to increase the chances of a good outcome. This is especially true in cognitive impairment. Whether it\u2019s normal age-related memory issues, or something more severe, like Alzheimer\u2019s, knowing where a patient is, cognitively, is crucial.Diagnostic tests like looking for biomarkers in the blood are not available for most cases of dementia. Alzheimer\u2019s has no definitive test that can say with the same certainty as an X-ray or other assays that there is a problem. Many patients must go through complex neuropsychological testing and detailed questionnaires on their health and habits. These kinds of tests are time-consuming and can be expensive as well. They are not entirely objective either, because confounding factors like IQ, socioeconomic status, and environmental factors such as places of residence. Estimates from the WHO and the CDC have shown that globally, the number of older adults that will develop dementia is growing every year. Right now about 50 million people worldwide are living with some form of cognitive decline, so anything that aids in early detection is vital.A team of researchers from the UK and Switzerland has developed a remarkably simple assessment that their study suggests could help improve the process of early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI.) About 30 to 50 percent of patients with MCI will go on to develop Alzheimer\u2019s so a test that can measure impairment would be useful in helping patients and their caregivers set up early interventions like therapy, activities, or diet changes to stay as healthy as possible for as long as possible.The research included UK researchers Dr. Trudi Edginton from City, University of London and Dr. Alison Eardley from the University of Westminster and was led by Professor Micah Murray from the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. It was published in the journal Scientific Reports. The cohort was 123 participants. Of the group, 51 were healthy young adults, 49 were healthy older adults, and the remaining 23 were older adults with a diagnosis of MCI. What they were asked to do was quite simple, but provided results the scientists say were valuable. Volunteers were asked to push a button whenever they hear a sound or see a light flash. The sounds and lights were visible on a laptop screen, but the team says that it\u2019s possible that an app for a smartphone or tablet could come out of the work.The patients in the study had to indicate when they heard just a sound, saw just a light or when they noticed both at the same time. The speed at which they indicated what they had seen or heard was measured. Cognition is often assessed via the sense of hearing or vision, so the test, while simple, can show quite a bit about a patient\u2019s mental acuity. Using just the two measurements of whether they were faster at detecting light or sound and how fast they were able to detect a combination of both, the researchers say they were able to tell which had MCI and which did not accurately.Professor Murray explained the work, stating \u201cWe are particularly excited about this work because it shows how very simple tests can help clinical practice by reaching a wider population, at a lower cost. We are happy that our findings clarify the link between our vision and hearing and their role in supporting memory (dys-)function; it becomes increasingly clear that how preserved our cognitive skills are as we age depends on how intact our senses are. This importantly extends our similar existing findings in school-age children.\u201dThe clip below talks about cognitive impairment and some of the signs to look for, check it out.",

However, I remember reading notes in my Office diary the otherday, that Iwas at an Evening Service in Oxford and was staggered to hearthe priest praying for me.My wife said that I looked at her in disbelief, and perhaps shock,wondering why I was being prayed for, when I was in church. I now understand that it is quite common, to pray for everyone whois ill these days, but I confess this did not help me at the time, and left mefeeling very confusedOriginally, Ihad started going to this eveningservicebecause it was veryquiet compared to the normal Sunday service, andeasier to cope withAt this stage I had forgotten how to say the Lord\u2019s Prayer, and ittook a lot of demanding work to bring it all back.We eventually moved back to my family home in the North East, andwe decided to return to my old church where we had been married and where I hadbeen in the choir for over ten years.I then realised that the words I had learnt again, were totallydifferent to those being said at the service.After going to a second service where they sang the Lord\u2019s Prayer,I decided enough was enough, simply because I don't cope with constant changes.By this stage, I simply could not read words and sing at the sametime.I then found that the Church leaders were not interested in peoplewith memory problems, because we were told that if I was not happy I shouldattend the 8 am service on a Sunday morning.While I struggle to cope with my religious beliefs these days, Ican understand why people turn to turn back to religion, to keep them going,and I guess to help them understand meaning of life.I guess it also gives them\u201dHope\", that small word witha big meaning. Hope can bring meaning into a person's life, and help them to facechallenging times without despair.Hope is future orientated and experiencing, and \"Hope\",provides the strength to cope with painful and stressful events, such asreceiving a diagnosis of Dementia Hope gives a person the will power to think a cure may come along,or medication may improve orstop their illness in its tracks.Finding \"Hope\" is a means of coping with this illness,and what is happening in our lives, and Professionals need to be aware, thateven when \"Hope\" is unrealistic people must find their own meaning tolife Although I am struggling to cope with my faith these days, I stillhave \"Hope\"I know that even though I lose the ability to do some things, I\"HOPE\" to fight on, enjoying my family for a bit longer, and enjoyingthe hobbies I can still do without assistance. I know that I will never be able to enjoy my faith in the same wayas I used to do, because of the constant changes to services and prayers thesedays, but as one clergyman said recently, that\u2019s the way things are moving inthe Church of England and there is nothing anyone can do about it.To me it feels as if the religious leaders in thiscountryhave turned their backs on those who are ill and struggling with theirfaith.Many clergy say that it's a waste of time performing services infront of those who have memory problems or dementia, because they simply cannottake an active part. If only they took the time to think carefully.Many grew up with familiar types of service and forms of prayer,and do not cope with constant changes to services etc.So, we must all fund our own way, and Hope we can carry on as bestwe can.

I have heard this on many occasions, which makes me think that the accusersreally do not have a clue about the basics of this illness.Treat the person as you would have done before the dementia, we may have anillness, but in many ways we are the same as you, we are all human.Try to speak clearly, carefully, slowly, and where possible face to face, sothat we stand a chance of understanding what you are trying to say. Please don\u2019t assume that you know all the answers about dementia and what itis like to live with it, but ask us, the people living with Dementia, and wewill tell you what our problems are.Remember that people with strong accents, asking questions can be difficultto understand when you have this illness. As someone who grew up in the NorthEast I now struggle with the accent these days, so if it is difficult for me,think what it is like for others.Try to speak in a calm voice and not get agitated otherwise it makes thosewith the illness react in the same way.

To many of these people, these bays are just normal parking bays, and they have the right to park there. They seem to resent people with disabilities and that is so wrong.In the 1980s my wife had a serious road accident, which ended up with her having umteem operations over two years in a hospital. She had terrible problems walking, and she was awarded one of the Blue Badges for our car.After three years she handed it back because she no longer needed it, but many people thought that this was wrong because she could have carried in using it.Being strong willed she said that she would rather walk for her fitness, and I thought it was good, but many friends complained about it.I would not want one of these, as I like to walk or use the bus when ever I can, but there are thousands of worthy people within this country who have need of them, so I am pleased that the law is changing, to help those who really need them.Let us all hope that these badges reach those in need, and restrictions are put in place to stop the abuse of the Blue Badge Scheme within the UK",

Along with that I understand that there are restrictions on operations, because the \"anaesthetic\", if that's how it is spelt, can have an effect on our brains.However due to back and hip problems, the Orthopaedic consultant decided to try and injection in my hip, in the hope of isolating the constant pain I struggle with. However he also did this in the hope of stopping the need for operations in the future.I am restricted on how far I can walk without stopping due to balance, and pain problems, but I try to force myself to walk around 3 miles a day, if not more, depending on how I feel on the day.Sometimes this includes many stops to relieve the pressure on my back, but I feel that it has to be done. Even if it takes me all day to cover that distance I am proud that I can do itHowever as this injection has failed I am being sent for an MRI scan on my spine, along with an appointment to see the pain management team. He was also disappointed that the physiotherapy department did not give me much supportI believe that this is the first hospital consultant outside the memory clinic, where they asked my wife for her views as well as my own, so he must have read his notes properly and understood that she was my carer, and knows more about my problems, than I am able to remember.He also took his time going over his plans to find out what the problem is, and this was done in easy to understand terms.I always joke about the fact that my brain and memory, are as much good as a Chocolate Tea Pot, simply because I simply don't remember how I felt on any day, so it's good having someone with me who can remember everythingHowever when we got home my wife went over what had been said, and reminded me of future appointments.While it's very important to keep fit, it's not always as easy as it looks when you are living with multiple medical problems, but I am determined to keep going as long as I can.While I understand that I have had back and neck problems for over 40 years, I have to accept that this may well end up as osteoarthritis of the spine, due to all of the damage from working in industry all of my life, and I may well be stuck with it for the rest of my life.",

        "content": "Because I struggle with very graphic nightmares and dreams at night, I have struggled to find ways of coping.This I gather is called R.E.M, and is part of my illnessThis usually starts within three hours of going to sleep, although there times when it's started much later if I have been up during the night, to go to the toilet etc.Sometimes when I wake up, it's very difficult to work out what is part of this horror, and what is reality. Even if I get the chance to wake up from these and get out of bed, it's a struggle to work out whether I am free or not. Sometimes I sit in the bathroom and then try to work out whether I am actually in the bathroom or still dreaming.I have at times hurt myself by thumping on the wall in desperation to work out where I am.This is all because it's difficult to work out the truth.What is reality and when is it still part of the nightly horror.A few years ago we were flooded at home, so we were living in a small flat.One night I had a horrible night, but remembered getting out of bed in three occasions, and then went into our lounge to recover, and while I was up I went to the toilet, or so I thoughtEventually I woke up and realised that it was all part of the nightly horror, and I had in fact never left the bed during the night. My wife remembers me jumping out of the bed in desperation the next morning, because I had remembered \"going to the toilet\" on three occasions, and thought I must have relieved myself in bed during the horror.Thankfully I had not done anything, but this shook me rigid, because it was all so graphic, and the fact that I can describe these horrors in full during the next day is quite frightening.But the fact that your brain tricks you into thinking you have got up, is not a nice thing to understand.My wife actually tried to wake me up one night, and then she became part of this horror. The next morning we were both shocked because she had an enormous black eye, and this left me feeling terribly upset.So this proves our carers, have to be extremely careful when trying to wake someone from a graphic nightmare, because they themselves can become part of the horrorOn one occasion I had been given medication, in the hope it would help and stop these horrors, but it actually made matters much worse.A few days after being given this medication, we had gone on holiday, and I guess I was lucky to get back home again, because I tried to climb out of the hotel bedroom window, to get away from the nightly horror. I was saved by my wife who woke up just in time, and the fact that the window was locked so would not open fully. The fact that this was a third floor bedroom was frightening.The next morning the medication was reduced, after my wife contacted the consultant.I have no real idea what causes these nights, because I try to relax before I go to bed. Yes there are nights when I dread closing my eyes, because of the fear of what may happen once I drift off, but usually these things bear no resemblance to reality what so ever.Through this I have taken to using my iPod touch to play relaxing music, but sometimes, this can have the wrong effect if it has the wrong rhythmHowever this can have the wrong effect at times.Sometimes the wrong type of music can trigger these horrors to start again,On other times I have been woken up by my wife, who in turn had been woken up by me singing to the songs on my I Pod, while being deep asleep.One night I had been listening to Glen Campbell singing one of his CDs, and my wife was woken up by me singing \"Rhinestone Cowboy\".On another occasion I woke my wife up while singing songs from \"Queen\"I gather she was not amused by this, and threatened to stop me using the I Pod.On another occasion I had rolled over and had caught the earphone cable up on something, this meant it came away from my iPod, and the music was playing loud a clear around the bedroom, so I was in trouble yet again.So I had to resort to classical music, and not songs.However anything which helps me through the night is well worth trying",

It also causes problems if it's a friend walking towards you, and then it's embarrassing not being able to recognise them from a short distance.Or walking towards a doorway can cause problems because I either hit the doorframe or the door handles causing bruises to the arms.Things like walking through a doorframe is something we all take for granted, until one day when you hit the side and find people looking at you as if you are drunk or stupidI often sit at the table and forget which hand is used to hold what when eating and this makes me feel and look clumsy. I guess this is because I now struggle to understand which is left and which is right, so I end up putting one hand out hoping it is correctThese days coping with fast moving people and trollies in supermarkets can be horrendous on some days. On some days I find it hard when children come up from behind of in front of my on these shoes with wheels on there heels etc. I suppose it's because they move so fast and my brain cannot keep up with things anymore.However eyesight or visual perception has caused many other concerns over the years because, I cannot read something like an email, and get the true meaning each time. Some times my brain tells me one thing, while in all honesty the email is saying something else. This means that unless my wife checks it, I can sometimes send back the wrong reply.So these days all documents are read by my wife, and then she explains them to me. I can see the time coming when things like the blog, Twitter and Facebook etc, will be closed down, because they will be too difficult to use.I admit that this will be very hard, but I would rather give up than end up looking sillyI remember using lots of big words while I was working, now I simply don't understand what they mean, and end up asking my wife. It's hard to imagine that one word can cause so many problems, because the brain tells me that it's one thing, then when I look at it again, I see something else.Even listening to the radio or television, I have to ask what something means.",

Many people with dementia don't have full time or live in carers, so they at a disadvantage to others, but how many doctors take this on board.This is also largely disregarded by many officials within the NHS and other services, but we are being forced to do everything on line, whether you are competent to do it or not, and now we hear, that we are going to be forced to do online consultations with doctors rather than getting an appointment at the doctors surgery.I don't understand this, and in all honesty I can't see this saving a doctors time at all, because it still takes time to talk to a doctor in the surgery, but surely it is better to do this face to face, where a doctor can see your problems.Many people don't understand how to use things like web-chat etc or skype, but we are now being asked to do this rather than getting an appointment. I confess that I don't like it neither does my wife, and we have tried this at times when trying to talk to our family at Christmas.On top of this we are being forced to do on line prescriptions etc, something I don't do because I don't understand what medications I am on or what they are for, so it's no good me doing this.However recently we have noticed that there seems to be a lack of doctors around the surgeries and more of these are using nurse practitioners rather than doctors. While some of these may be good at their job, I find them to be rather stressful as they don't seem to understand or take on board your problems. We used to have one who was brilliant, but she sadly left.Sooner or later NHS England and the NHS have to realise that going on line is not the answer to the problem, it may end up with more people going to A&E to get the support they need.There are too many people using A&E these days and I do feel that this can only make matters much worse.Not too long ago we used to have a lot of brilliant officials working within the NHS, who knew all about Dementia etc, but as with everything else these days, they were lost or made redundant, to be replaced by people trying to reinvent the wheel.Let us hope things change before it's too late.",

As everyone keeps telling me, my brain and mouth or eyes are not always working together, so at times, I open my mouth and then cause havoc by saying something I really shouldn\u2019t have said. Most people understand and make allowances, but it\u2019s still very frightenening when it happens.Yes I get a lot more agitated and annoyed these days, but it\u2019s because things are more difficult to work out, and after being an engineer for 28 years I find this hard to accept.I have got into trouble on more than one occasion by my wife and family, because I may have a fixed facial expression, or mask. It\u2019s not intended, because I may be struggling to understand what is happening, or trying to work out why I can\u2019t do a simple job. I am not depressed or stressed, it just seems to be something which happens.This can lead to things becoming distressing, but I have to live with it.Due to the feeling of exhaustion every day after a slight walk or doing simple tasks, I decided to cut back and now I take things very easy, and think about myself and my family.Although I used to love going for walks, I don\u2019t enjoy it as much these days, because of the tiredness, and constant dragging of my feet which sometimes causes me to trip up.But I do feel that we must take each day as it comes, and try to get the best we can out of a bad situation, and even though it\u2019s not easy we have to try, for our families sake as well as our own.I know that each day can be different, and in some cases things change in one day, and that can be alarming.

This was because I enjoyed the walks there and back with school friends who lived nearbyWhen I was in the Scouts I really enjoyed hiking around the country, or walking around mountains, because I loved the countryside, along with the peace at timesWhile I was restricted by breathing problems at times, I kept pushing myself to keep up with others, and never give in or stopped, until I really had too.I suppose in those days, it was not an option, because I did not want to feel like a week link, or hold others upAs a teenager I always had chest problems, which were put down as asthma, but I was still fairly activeI was never one to sit and do nothing at all, and my parents always thought there was something wrong, because, I never sat down for very long before I was bored out of my mindI was one if those who was always on the move or doing something to keep myself occupied.I always loved walking and have walked on many occasions, when I could and possibly should have got a bus.Yes I have a free bus pass, but it's only used on journeys that are too far to walk.I get annoyed when people get on a bus at one stop, then get off at the next bus stop, which up is usually 500 yards away.To me that's being lazy, unless you have serious medical problem, but I do think these free bus passes encourage many to be lazy these days.Ever since I was diagnosed as having early onset Lewy Body Dementia, I have tried to remain active.However many professionals have said in the past that people Iike me should sit down and take it easy, most of those were social workers.I have never done that unless my chest has been playing up. I would rather enjoy life in whatever way I can.Even if I am wheezing when i breathe at times, I force myself to carry on. This is because it's good to exercise the lungs.These days I struggle to walk the long distances, due to my torn knee, Osteoarthritis in the hip, coupled with Bilareral Bronchiectasis and Emphysema, but I still try to push myself as much as I can.Sometimes I hit lucky and enjoy it, but then on other days I know I have done too muchHowever on those days I usually pay for it later, but which time it's too late.Walking helps the breathing if you pace yourself properly, and that in turn keeps us fit.These days I usually take my camera with me, so that it's easier to pace myself, however I have been known to get carried away when watching wildlife, and then I walk too far.However photography has allowed me to remain active, and keep my mind occupied This side of things I do for my memory problems.However it's hit and miss, and I can go out sometimes, then just forget the camera settings which is stressfulThere is something quite relaxing and calming, about going for a walk around the riverside park, and spending time sitting with the swans and ducksSome people find swans to be intimidating, but I find them quite calming Two weeks ago my wife bought a garmin vivofit and I have managed to pace myself each day, and this device keeps track on how far I have walked.This is then downloaded on to the computer every night. Yes there are days when I don't walk every day due to my medical conditions, but I do my best and that's the important thing.It's too easy to sit back and do nothing when you can't be bothered, but I know that if I keep going, it's better for me all roundThese days I have to keep covered up, because I burn if I am in the sun too long. The doctor said that it's because of all of the antibiotics and other medication.I have never been one to use sun caps, so I find these things hard to get on with, but after being badly sunburnt I realise that they are importantIts also been pointed out that the long term use of these medicines also mean that the eyes can get burnt ?I find this very hard to understand, but I have been told that it's a fact, so I have to cover my eyes too,But it's all for the best and I have to accept these changes",

Not so long ago I was told that I had drop foot on the right side, but these days after a short walk it seems to be getting harder to move my legs let alone pick both of my feet up.I really enjoy walking, but these days the pleasure has gone out of it, and even going upstairs is like climbing a mountain at times.Whatever this is, it has come on fast, recently, and is frightening at times, when you are out somewhere and find your legs and back don't want to go any further.The other day we went to our static caravan in Barnard castle, and then walked down to the town centre, a journey I have down many times over the last few years, and even though I have osteoarthritis in my right hip I managed to get there and back when needed.I always felt sore and tired afterwards, but this time I struggled to get anywhere near to half way back, and had to stop a quite a few times. We were going to get a bus so far up the hill, but sadly we missed it, so I said I was going to try walking backI guess it was too cold and damp to stop until the next bus, and I know that if I had stopped I would not have moved for a while.Even sitting down can be uncomfortable, now and I tend to lean forwards or to my side to get some relief for my back, which is fine at home or in the caravan, but it\u2019s not much good on a bus, unless is a comfortable coach, like the ones used on holiday's.I have no idea what is causing this, but until I hear from the hospital we may never get to the bottom of it, but I am certainly not a good patient, and find it hard to sit still for long because I get bored very easy these days.My wife has planned a short holiday in Scotland with our church over the next Bank Holiday weekend, so this may help just to get away for a while. its a nice hotel and very comfortable coaches, so I am hopefulHowever no matter what happens, I know in my own mind that I need to completely change my life style and how I do things, while trying to pace myself, rather than forcing myself to do too much.Life can be unpredictable as we all know, but with medical issues like this, life becomes annoying at times.I still live my photography and will try to focus on this, on my good days, in the hope that I can take my mind off the rest of my problemsOn Friday we had a letter telling me that I have an appointment with a consultant on Tuesday \"today\", so with a bit of luck we my find out what has caused this problem to appear so fast.

The test correctly excluded all the 31 controls and diagnosed both Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies with 93 percent accuracy.    All the testing of the samples and analysis of results was done at Rocky Mountain Lab in Hamilton by a lab group led by Dr. Byron Caughey.Importantly, test results were available within two days, compared to others that require up to 13 days. Scientists from the University of California San Diego, University of Verona in Italy, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, and the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, collaborated on the project.The research findings were published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications.    Multiple neurological disorders, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, involve the abnormal clumping of a protein into brain deposits called Lewy bodies.The pathological processes in these diseases resembles prion diseases in mammal brains. Like prion diseases, Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies result in progressive deterioration of brain functions and, ultimately, death.    Parkinson\u2019s disease is about 1,000 times more common than prion diseases, affecting up to 1 million people in the United States, with 60,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Lewy body dementia affects an estimated 1.4 million people in the United States, according to the Lewy Body Dementia Association.Early and accurate diagnoses of these brain disorders is essential for developing treatments and identifying patients eligible for clinical trials. The diseases typically progress for years before symptoms appear, and once they do, distinguishing one disease from another can be difficult.The group continues to adapt the tests to detect additional types of neurological diseases with greater accuracy using the least invasive patient sample possible \u2014 whether that is blood, skin, nasal brushings, or other samples. The group also has trained many international colleagues to use and advance the test.",

However I have seen and read many stories about people in the North East which have made me proud of the area. People with 4 wheel drive vehicles offering to take doctors and nurses into hospitals, when they were stuck without transport.Some spending time recovering vehicles stuck in the deep snow, without and thought of rewards etc. Some nurses staying in the hospitals when they are finished, because there was no guarantees of them getting home again, let alone getting back to work the next day.

Things like taking the council tax from the North East and giving it to places like Surrey etc. However I do think many people are fed up with the lying politicians in this country, and sick to death of this Brexit rubbish which should have been sorted out long ago.I do feel that now many people have decided to take things into their own hands to keep their communities moving, a bit like the war time spirit.

The media as usual have done their normal thing, which is to blame the council's etc, for not clearing all of the roads even when they are short of money.

        "content": "DEAR MAYO CLINIC: What\u2019s the difference between Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s? How is Lewy body dementia diagnosed?ANSWER: Doctors diagnose Lewy body dementia based on the range of symptoms a person shows. Generally, the diagnosis requires an ongoing decline in thinking skills, along with two of the following: visual hallucinations, Parkinsonism or fluctuating alertness. In addition, people who have Lewy body dementia also may experience a sleep condition known as REM sleep behavior disorder, in which people act out their dreams while they sleep. They also may have instability in their blood pressure and heart rate, and the body may have difficulty controlling body temperature and sweating.A brain disease that gets worse over time, Lewy body dementia is caused by an abnormal protein, called synuclein, which is deposited in certain nerve cells and nerve processes. These deposits are called Lewy bodies \u2014 named after the physician who first identified them. In Lewy body dementia, Lewy bodies are found in the deep structures of the brain that control movement, as well as in the middle and outer structures involved in emotion, behavior, judgment and awareness.Many patients with Lewy body dementia also have overlapping\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s disease. About half of Lewy body patients have significant Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as well. Thus, it is not surprising that those diagnosed with Lewy body dementia have symptoms associated with Alzheimer disease, such as memory loss and naming difficulty. However, when doctors who have expertise and experience with the disease make a Lewy body dementia diagnosis, that diagnosis is often correct \u2014 as confirmed later during an autopsy. An accurate diagnosis is important, because Lewy body dementia responds differently than Alzheimer\u2019s disease to commonly prescribed dementia medications.Lewy body dementia usually progresses gradually over several years, but the way it progresses can vary significantly from person to person. For example, Lewy body dementia may begin with signs of dementia, and Parkinsonism appears later. Or the disease may start with movement difficulties, and signs of dementia don\u2019t emerge for some time. Most people with Lewy body dementia experience the onset of Parkinsonism and dementia within one year. As Lewy body dementia progresses, all symptoms usually become more severe.Hallucinations occur early in Lewy body dementia but only after about four years in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. If a person acts out dreams, that is strong evidence that he or she has synuclein protein in the brain. This protein is found only in Lewy body dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease and a rare disease called multiple system atrophy. Acting out one\u2019s dreams is a feature in all of these diseases.Lewy body dementia is a complex disease, and it can be difficult to control. Currently, there\u2019s no cure. But, when treatment is carefully managed, symptoms may be reduced, so they have less effect on a person\u2019s daily functioning and quality of life.Some people diagnosed with Lewy body dementia respond positively to medications called cholinesterase inhibitors. They boost the level of a chemical messenger in the brain called acetylcholine that\u2019s important for memory and other cognitive functions. These drugs may help improve alertness and reduce hallucinations and signs of dementia.Other medications are available to help decrease the Parkinsonism, hallucinations and other Lewy body dementia symptoms. These medications must be closely monitored by a health care provider. In people who have Lewy body dementia, medications to improve motor function may make symptoms such as hallucinations worse, and medications used to combat dementia may increase Parkinsonism.Because Lewy body dementia treatment needs to be managed skillfully to obtain the most effective results, people who have this disease should be monitored by a physician with expertise and experience with Lewy body dementia \u2014 usually a neurologist or a neuropsychiatrist. \u2014 Neill Graff-Radford, M.D., Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Fla.(Mayo Clinic Q & A is an educational resource and doesn\u2019t replace regular medical care.

However it's not just the Bishops, it's down to the Government who have cut the services down to the bare minimum, while enjoying a healthy life style In all honesty I don't think I can ever remember so many religious people in a Government, yet they simply don't care about anyone or anything but them selves How can these people including the Prime Minister, dare to go into a church every Sunday as if there is nothing wrong. \"These people cannot possibly know or understand the meaning of religion\"I honestly think that this country is now, in a worse position than it's ever been since the 2nd world war, yet these people cannot see what they are doing.There are thousands of people using food banks, along with thousands living and sleeping on the streets each night, all of who should have been picked up by social care. So many people living on the bread line that this really does not make any sense at all. I would have thought that they would have moved social care into the NHS, before now because councils cannot afford to run the service and thousands are suffering as a consequence of thisI would have thought that social care was a legal right, but obviously many of our politicians think the oppositeSome claim that the NHS could not possibly carry the social care side of life.But if we are honest about all of this, the NHS, is to big, with far too many quangos hidden inside it. The last Lady Tory Prime minister Margaret Thatcher got rid of these quangos, but they are back.To many people these days think that the NHS are doctors surgeries and hospitals? When in fact it takes in lots of areas, from research to thousands of people working in office blocks around the country, for the Department of Health, and also the NHS in all of it's different variations. The NHS could cope with social care, if the services were run properly and people like the weekend drunkards were charged for their treatment and services.Millions of pounds are wasted every year on people abusing the system, and it's time things changed, to allow treatment to go to those up in real need. I am sure that if the NHS was running social care, they could have care homes built in so that this people needing care at home could be moved out of hospitals, thereby freeing up beds. This all makes sense to me, but I am not a politicianLet us hope things change soon and for the best ",

It was strange to feel my ankle being held up in one position, but at least it worked.We were concerned about the fact that this may have an effect in my ankles, as they tend to swell up at times, but the physiotherapist said that this should not happen. Once we got home it was removed to check thing's over, but all was well. We had been told that I was to wear it for a few hours a day, until I was happy with it.Later on in the afternoon and evening, I started having problems with my foot, knee and hip, which were very sore. But as my wife pointed out, the Brace is straightening up my foot which in turn is having a knock in effect on my hip etc. So I guess it's going to take time getting used to the effects of wearing this.

        "content": "December 2017Over the last few years I have had many minor accidents and many near misses, due to brain problems.I know that I am not alone with this problem because many others with neurological llnesses have the same, or very similar problemsHowever I do wonder how much is known about these problems, by the professionals like physiotherapists and occupational therapists.While they are true professionals, I guess their knowledge may be limited when it comes to certain neurological illnesses. After seeing people at the movement clinic, it annoyed me because they always say the same things without thinking about it. While some people are helpful, I do wonder about others. I sometimes go light headed when standing up after being sat down for a while. Their answer as usual, is to take it slowly, stand up slowly and then gradually turn or move off. But if you wake up from a snooze and need to go to the bathroom, the last thing in your mind is to rise slowly. It's the same when someone comes to the door or the phone rings, you just want to get there without thinking about anything else. My memory simply does not cope with remembering to do things slowly, because I either don't remember to do it, or I am in a hurry.I guess it's the same thing when I am writing on my computer, because my brain is trying to go much faster than my fingers, so I miss words out of a sentence, without even noticing until I check it much later One problem I have at home, is that when I am washing up in the kitchen, I some times turn to walk away, which is quite normal, if that is your brain is normal. But in my case I have this problem where my body moves, but my feet stay firmly fixed to the spot, \"Freezing\" so it's a case of grabbing something or facing the floor or anything else which gets in the way.When I was working I heard about an alcoholic drink which used to give people the idea, that they were sober until they tried to move. Needless to say their bodies moved, but their feet stayed firmly welded to the floor.I had no idea what this drink was, and had no intention of trying it, because I can get the same effect without having a drink these days.I gather this \"Freezing\" thing is part of Parkinson's disease, which may be the case, but it's embarrassing when it happens as well as distressing While I can understand that these physotherapists and other experts are trying to be helpful, I do wonder if they really understand what we are going through. Trying to live a normal life, doing things around the house etc, is my way of being helpful while remaining active.However there comes a time when I just don't want to do anything because of musjudging things.Even washing up can be a nightmare at times, because I often misjudged distances between the basin taps and the items in my hands, so things get damaged or broken. It's not even a ploy to get out of washing up, because I like to keep active in any way I can, but there are days when I will not wash a drinking glass up just in case I break it, and I have done this on many occasions I tried to explain recently that I some times misjudged things like the curb at the edge of footpaths. But this is all coupled to the fact that I cannot judge things like speeds or distances anymore, and this can lead to me being dragged back by my wife who is more switched on. Furniture in our house has been set out so that I can grab something if I am going to fall, or if I get up too fast, but the brain does not always recognise these things at times. I also have a habit of missing a door opening at times and bump into the door frame or the door, ending up being bruised. Here again I find this to be a nightmare, if I need to get up during the night.I know where I am going, but I think my brain sends me in a straight line, but forgets about the obstructions which are in the way. It's embarrassing enough when it happens at home, but when I am else where it feels much worse because people tend him think I am either on something or I am drunk. I can understand how the police etc, misunderstand our actions, and think we may have been drinking, but it does not really help us.",

        "content": "Taken from an earlier BlogWhen I was undergoing my first diagnosis in Oxford, and was stillworking, I never let my religious beliefs go.I suppose I was hoping that my religion would keep me going, andwould save me from whatever was coming.At this time most, clergy prayed for those who were sick, ordying, and it was generally accepted, because these people were usuallyseriously ill, either at home in bed or in hospital. However, I remember reading notes in my old Office diary the otherday, that Iwas at an Evening Service in Oxford and was staggered to hearthe priest praying for me. My wife said that I looked at her in disbelief, and perhaps shock,wondering why I was being prayed for, when I was in church. I now understand that it is quite common, to pray for everyone whois ill these days, but I confess this did not help me at the time, and left mefeeling very confusedOriginally, Ihad started going to this eveningservicebecause it was veryquiet compared to the normal Sunday service, andeasier to cope with, however by this stage I had forgotten how to say the Lord\u2019s Prayer, and ittook a lot of demanding work to bring it all back.We eventually moved back to my family home in the North East, andwe decided to return to my old church where we had been married and where I hadbeen in the choir for over ten years.I then realised that the words I had learnt again, were totallydifferent to those being said at the service. After going to a second service where they sang the Lord\u2019s Prayer,I decided enough was enough, simply because I don't cope with constant changes.By this stage, I simply could not read words and sing at the sametime.I then found that the Church leaders, from Bishops to Clergy, were not interested in peoplewith memory problems, because we were told that if I was not happy I shouldattend the 8 am service on a Sunday morning. At this point I had been struggling to sleep at night and had very graphic nightmares, which meant that I was just going to sleep at around 4-5am each day, but this was totally ignored by the church when it was mentioned.Having spoken to a few elderly clergymen over the last few years, they are lost for words when I discuss this, but it sounds as if this is the way modern churches are goingWhile I struggle to cope with my religious beliefs these days, Ican understand why people turn to turn back to religion, to keep them going,and I guess to help them understand meaning of life.I guess it also gives them\u201dHope\", that small word witha big meaning. Hope can bring meaning into a person's life, and help them to facechallenging times without despair.Hope is future orientated and experiencing, and \"Hope\",provides the strength to cope with painful and stressful events, such asreceiving a diagnosis of Dementia Hope gives a person the will power to think a cure may come along,or medication may improve orstop their illness in its tracks.Finding \"Hope\" is a means of coping with this illness,and what is happening in our lives, and Professionals need to be aware, thateven when \"Hope\" is unrealistic people must find their own meaning tolife Although I am struggling to cope with my faith these days, I stillhave \"Hope\"I know that even though I lose the ability to do some things, I\"HOPE\" to fight on, enjoying my family for a bit longer, and enjoyingthe hobbies I can still do without assistance. I know that I will never be able to enjoy my faith in the same wayas I used to do, because of the constant changes to services and prayers thesedays, but as one clergyman said recently, that\u2019s the way things are moving inthe Church of England and there is nothing anyone can do about it.To me it feels as if the religious leaders in thiscountryhave turned their backs on those who are ill, and struggling with theirfaith.Many clergy say that it's a waste of time performing services infront of those who have memory problems or dementia, because they simply cannottake an active part. If only they took the time to think carefully. I personally feel that this is the way clergy are trained these days, its not the best way, but with modern Bishops and modern ideas, things like people with dementia etc are largely forgotten as a waste of effort. In other words the days of pastoral care and visits from clergy are long gone and confined to the history booksMany people grew up with familiar types of service and forms of prayer,and do not cope with constant changes to services etc.Nor do they want to hear long winded sermons, which have no bearing on modern day life. As one elderly vicar once told me, it takes a lot of care and thought to do a sermon which means something these days, otherwise people simply give up all hope and drift offSo, we must all find our own way, and Hope we can carry on as bestwe can.Yes we lose so many hobby's and things we enjoy in life, but we have to adjust and move on, and I guess if that means losing touch with our religion, then so be it. Its not easy but we need to do want is best for us, and forget everything else.",

        "content": "After hearing in the News that a convicted rapist was being released back into the public domain again, I started to think of all of those abused by this evil monster. He will be able to move on with a new life, while those he abused will struggle to move on with their lives, and may never get any relief from what happened. The heart ache and trauma will live with them forever, and will be in the back of their minds for the rest of their lives. They will never really trust anyone, ever again. Many people have been abused over the years, some as children, some abused in married life by their husband/wife, some in the armed forces and others in schools or care homes. The military seem to get away with this by claiming, that its a way to toughen up recruits, but how can they get away with this sort of thing. No matter what happens in life, there really is no excuse at all. I can only assume that by abusing others, you are in some way forcing them to give in, so you are in fact controlling them. I think the lowest form of this is child abuse, either by a family member, or a friend of the family, a case where the child cannot speak up for themselves because no one will ever believe them. Children are usually threatened by the abuser, telling them that they will be ruined for life if they are to speak out. Having been haunted by this for years until I met my wife, I can understand the horrors others struggle with in a daily basis, and it never goes away. Like others I had no one to talk to, because the person was a close family friend and no one would have believed me. How many times has it been claimed, that the abuser was someone in a high profile or public position, and therefore the officials and police closed ranks, and believed the abuser, before the abused person. Jimmy Seville is a prime example of this, and yet for years neither the police or the BBC did anything about it, until he had died, by which time it was far too late to do anything. It was later on that I learnt that my mother had been abused by her step mother when she was a young child, simply because mother was adored by her father, something her step mother was jealous of. In this case mothe\u0155 was always being locked outside in a black dark coal house, which had rats running through it. So I guess that to a 5 year old child this must have been terrifying She often said that she hated the dark after this, because the memories of those horrors came back to her. But abuse seems to to be happening more these days, and it's made much worse by the fact that the media use it as a good story, to grab headlines, and this makes me sick. Other people who were abused as children, have often complained to the independent press association, but nothing ever happens. However this abuse often happens in institutions like schools, and even religious bodies are not immune from it, because in many cases they simply hid it from the public, and in some cases destroyed the evidence. When a religious body like the Catholic Church, or Church of England do this, it shows just how much contempt they have for those poor individuals who were abused while in their care. There really is no excuse for abuse of any kind in this day and age, and it should be outlawed. ",

Aschildren we grew up long side rivers, Electricity and hot water, but got onwith life, we never needed some over paid office worker to tell us the obvious. I wouldhave thought it obvious that electricity could give you a shock or kill you, sowhy do we need signs next to sockets, oroutside electrical substationsetc, warning of electrocution, or danger of shock.I nowwonder what has happened to this state, because people are no longer able tothink for themselves, and we oftenhear of people complaining these days, of the nanny State, but is it clear that these same people are not taking responsibility into their own hands. We havegone from an intelligent and caring nation, to one where it's easier to blame others, and suesomeone else, rather than using your own common sense, and this is quitefrightening. When Iwas younger you got on with life, watched what you were doing, and made sureyou were safe, if you had an accident, then you held your hands up and admittedit was your own fault, and never blamed anyone else for our own stupidity, but these days it appears that it'severyone else's fault, and not our own, so what has gone wrong.I firmlybelieve that it's health and safety to blame these days along with Insurance companies, because I think it hasgone too far. Thesedays I have problems walking, because of co-ordindination, eyesight and balanceissues, and the fact but I don't seem to be able to lift my feet as high as Iused to, which for some reason means that I seem to catch my foot on thepaving slabs, and this causes me to trip. But Idon't blame the council etc, because I know it's my problem not anyone else's. We had anoccasion recently when we ask the council to check the footpath outside ourproperty, because it was uneven. Someonecame along one day, to look at the problem, and then asked if we were going tosue them. Wife'sresponse was, that she was simply concerned that I may trip, on the unevensurface. We were then told, that to make it dangerous, any hole in a footpathwould needed to be more than 25mm deep, before it could be repaired, or classedas a safety concern. The oddthing was, that they came along the following day and dug up around 50mm,before resurfacing it again. Soobviously, because my wife had asked kindly and had pointed out my problems,they had thought it out properly. This leftus wondering how many people are suing the council's, for uneven footpaths,because they don't watch where they are going these days. However,when it comes to people with neurological illnesses, like dementia etc, I thinkhealth and safety is a mine field, and I can't in all honesty see how anyonewho does not have our illness, can tell us what to do, because they don'tunderstand our reasoning.I knowfrom my own problems, that things change so fast, and when your coordinationand thinking has gone astray, you become a liability at times, even in thehouse. Onemoment everything is clear in my mind, and then the next moment, I am aliability, but that's my brain, and no one can tell me how to look after my ownhealth and safety, because it simply does not work that way A simple thing like turning round sharply, can end up with a fall, because my body turns, while the feet stay fixed to the floorBut weare living in this life, and must cope with the impossible at times, and nomatter how many signs are put in place, you don't always recognise or see themOver the last two years, I have been seen by a physiotherapist for my balance issues, but they simply cannot take on board that my brain simply switches off at times, and I do something totally unexpected, or silly without even thinking. Its not deliberate, in fact as my wife will tell anyone, I get very annoyed with myself when I walk into something, or totally miss a step, but that's life Furniture in our house has been placed so that I can grab it if needed, but sometimes, I either walk into it or miss it completely. I guess this is to do with judgement and co ordination issues, but its my brain and I have to accept it and live with it. That doesnot mean that we need someone leading us around 24 hours a day, we just need tobe more aware of our surroundings, and that comes down to living in our ownconfirm zone. I havebeen to many places in the past, including many new buildings which have been aliability, as far as health and safety are concerned, especially where peoplewith neurological illnesses are involved. One placein London recently, had different sized stairs, and that was very confusing andhighly dangerous, especially if your brain and eyesight are not working as theyshould be. Yet this building was being used for a dementia meeting, and I wasleft staggered, by the fact that this was being used by a group whoaresupposed to be dementia friendly. Thisleads me to think, a bit more time and thought should be spent on the needs ofthose with neurological illnesses etc, and less time spent on complete idiots,who are just out to find an excuse to sue someone. No wonderinsurance costs are going up, when we consider this sue culture. Perhapsthey should live in our shoes for be day or so, then they might start to thinkwhat they are doing rather than blaming others",

        "content": "Diagnosis of dementia like many other illnesses, can be a very traumatic experience, for anyone to cope with, and if there is no support afterwards, life can become very difficult, and that is why I am so pleased the things have moved on.Many people find, that after the diagnosis they are left to fend for themselves, and must fight for support, not just at the consultation, but also in their community, and that is very wrong in this modern society. So much depends on the consultant, and how much information they discuss with you, because many people are given their diagnosis, and are then left to find her own way, including finding out more about illness and how to cope with it. Its usually well after seeing the consultant that the questions arise, by which time it's too late to get help.This leads to more problems, if you go onto the internet, you are told different things on different websites, many of which are not kept up to date, and you are then left wondering who or what to believe.Some people use social media to keep up to date with certain illnesses, but like Lewy Body Dementia, there are no UK based groups, as most are American, and their health and social care systems are differentAfter my 2nd diagnosis in County Durham, my new consultant told us about the illness, \" Lewy Body Dementia \", along with the medication, and then told told us to go to the nearest Alzheimer's Society branch, where we could get extra support and advice needed to carry on with life. The consultant also gave me this piece of advice, (You either Use it, or Lose it), meaning that by remaining active, it helps to keep the brain active. I was also told to write my life story, as a way of remaining active. It was recommended that I started at the diagnosis, and then worked back over, as and when memories came back, now this practice is widespread. However as with all things, a diagnosis of dementia is a postcode lottery, and not everyone has the benefit of a good consultant, coupled with good support services. I do feel that services are being stretched these days due to financial cuts, are too many local authorities and charities are not providing the services for people with dementia, like the services we used to see. Many simply run a service which is broad based, thinking that one topic covers everyone, but no matter what you do, you can never help people to remain active by using this method, because we all expect different things. Some people like singing while others don't like to sing. Some people like Dementia Cafes while others don't, because they find them to be overwhelming.Coupled with this, there are so many variations of dementia, and people with one type of dementia, may feel more at home in a different group. Like people with Lewy Body Dementia sometimes attend a Parkinson's Group, because the illnesses are similar, and they run different services As I said, we are all so very different, and want to do different things with our time A common myth in dementia, is that if you've seen one person with this, you then you know and understand everything there is to know about it, but just how long can this be, because we are all individuals with different problems and symptomsHaving said that, I found that the Church of England did little in our area to help people with dementia, and this was very hard for me to accept, having attended church on a regular basis all of my life.It was as if those with dementia were a hindrance, something I find disgusting and hard to accept. I think that we must encourage people to do everything they can to remain active, whether that means joining groups, where you can discuss your problems with others in the same position, of finding other activities which help you to remain active ",

        "content": "Over the last few years, a lot of work has been done in Banks to make them Dementia Friendly, but I do wonder if they have now had second thoughts My wife and I went round lots of North East Branch's of Lloyds Bank doing Dementia Friends training, and we werevery proud of their work.Now things have changed, but not for the best These days the staff in our local branch, insist on pushing people to use the machines, rather than speaking to a person at the till. I confess that I hardly use these machines, unless my wife is there for support, because they confuse me. I know that I am not alone with this, because other people have spoken out about it. It seems that Lloyds are cutting costs by reducing the numbers of staff at the cash tills, are expecting everyone to use these machines.However when you see the people queuing up, it's obvious that many don't feel comfortable using these machines. In our branch, most of the staff and managers have been changed, but we are lucky in as much as we still have a branch at the moment, because many local branches have been replaced by a mobile bank. I don't like this at all, because I get very nervous using machines in the first place, but won't use external machines, which are next to a busy bus stop, where other people can watch what you are doing .I do wonder how many of these new staff really understand that many people with neurological illnesses, and the elderly etc, don't cope with technology in first place. It seems to me that they would be better using the extra tills, rather than having extra staff on the floor, pushing people towards self service machines Before this all happened, most of the staff were caring and understanding, now I really wonder It worries me that many other companies are claiming to be Dementia Friendly, and are doing the courses for the wrong reasons, or are doing the courses but not actually following through and doing something positive for thise living with dementia ",

        "content": "From a blog in 2005 which was updated last year but never used As more and more people are being diagnosed with dementia these days, I thought it would help to bring back another old blog. When my diagnosis was completed in 2005, I met many people who are now old friends, many of which are still fighting on. These people were I guess very lucky like me, but I guess one thing separates them from others, is the fact that like me they chose to look at life in a different way after the diagnosis, and get as much as possible out of life from then on. We are all different, with individual symptoms and problems, and no two people are the same, something that many people don't understand, but then there are many types of dementia We only need to look at Christine Bryden in New Zealand, who was diagnosed over 20 years ago, and is still doing presentations at conferences all round the world.This lovely lady has seen scans to prove that her brain has shrunk, and although she was not given a lot of hope early on, she chose to fight on regardless, and has written books about her experience.The diagnosis usually comes as a great shock to many, simply because it's something that no one wants, yet many find new ways to keep themselves occupied.I met one gentleman back in 2005, who had vascular dementia, yet he is still going strong. I understand that it all depends on when you were diagnosed as far as the illness is concerned, but if you are young enough, the world is your oyster As one consultant in Newcastle once said, You either \"Use Your Brain or Lose it\".In other words fight on and don't look back, or give in.If we want to fight dementia and memory problems, we must remain active, as my old consultant once told meThis means staying as active as possible, by using what ever method you can.Some use crossword puzzles, some use other board games, while others use other activities such as photography, walking or meeting at day groups.I don't attend day groups as I have always been active, and tried to keep myself amused in photography or walking when ever I can, although I have problems walking at times at timesHowever I really enjoy walking round the riverside watching the ducks and swans etc, and get a lot of pleasure sitting watching them when it's quiet.I also enjoy my time at our static caravan in Barnard Castle, where everyone knows me, and I can enjoy myself There used to be a discussion group in our area run by the Alzheimer's society, but this is no longer running, but it was a wonderful way to keep in touch with others. This group used to be lively, because we all had one or other form of dementia, and we understood everyone else's problems and accepted them. I accept that others may not wish to meet up and talk to others, but I do feel, that once you understand that you are not on your own, life takes on a different meaning. Many feel isolated and unable to discuss their problems with others, because of the stigma which is attached to this illness But I always said that I would be happy to talk to others in our area in the hope of helping them to cope and move on. This is why I spend time giving presentations to graduate nurses at Northumbria University, in the hope that I can inspire others to grasp the nettle and do something positive for others  But I do suggest people join groups in they are available in your area, if not join a dementia charity and see what support they have in your areaI think it's good to mix with others on the same journey if the resources are there, but there seems to be nothing here apart from singing for the brain, and as I no longer enjoy singing this one is out.Many people like painting and other forms of art. So go on express yourself. There are no art groups in our area, but I am hoping to start to learn to paint very soonSo if anyone gets a diagnosis of dementia, do not sit and let it get to you. Enjoy your hobbies, enjoy mixing with others, and what is more remember that you are not alone in having this illness, you are among friends.Many people give up fighting after being given a diagnosis of dementia, while others prefer to fight on regardless We are all so very different and react in different Never give up, and try to talk to others who understand   ",

        "content": "I looked at this topic in 2009, but I do think that its important thesedays tooThere are lots of stories these days about using animals in houses andcare homes, and it was only after talking about this with my wife, that somememories came back about our pets at home.For years we have seen Guide Dogs on our streets, supporting those witheyesight problems, and now we are hearing more about the power of animals inthe lives of those who have a long-term illness etcI heard the story of one dog, who was able to detect when it's owner wasgoing into an epileptic fit, and would get between the owner\u2019s head and theground, to prevent injury to its owner.These days we hear about Dementia support dogs etc, who are trained tosupport those living with this illness, in the same way as support dogs assistthose living with eyesight problemsThere are also dogs which support those with chest problems, and I personally find this to be amazing, but I think it\u2019s because peoplehave now finally realised that animals understand more about us than we thoughtperhaps 10 years ago. It\u2019s amazing just how far dogs have gone in supporting people who areill these days. The way they can detect cancer, or the way an animal can detectthat a person is going to have a fit, is inspiring.I wonder how many people would have thought of this in the pastLooking backWhen this illness was starting to kick in we had a cat and a dog, whogot on quite well.At first the cat would come and either sit beside me on a seat, orwould lie next to me on the bed, when I was worried about what was happening.Sadly, she passed away and was a great loss not just to the humans, but alsoBen our Labrador cross dog.Ben had his own problems with his nerves, as he did not like loudnoises, something that I was able to understand, when my own hearing becameacute due to the Lewy body dementia.But Ben would follow me closely when I was being diagnosed, and neverlet me out of his sight.Although this was nice, it also drove me mad at times, because if I wentto the bathroom, he would be sat outside the door when I came out.When I was on my own at times, I would lie of the couch downstairs,whereI could lie flat, and occasionally I would wake up to find himsnuggled up alongside me, then he would disappear as if he was embarrassed tobe found there. We wondered if it was to help me feel secure, or whether he thought Ineeded support, or he was keeping me warm, something we will never knowHe would do the same if I was extremely tired and went to lie on the bedfor a rest, he would be there as soon as my eyes were closed.When I had problems seeing things during the day like hallucinations, Iknew it was just my brain because he could not see anything, so I felt safe.This helped me to cope in the early days.Even if I was up during the night with my bad dreams and nightmares, hewould get out of his bed and sit by my feet, until I went back to bed.After the diagnosis it became apparent that something was wrong withhim, so we took him to the vets, where we were told that he was ill, and theywould need to do some tests.This was distressing for me as we had become so attached. We werethen told that his liver had started to fail, and it would be better to put himout of his misery as he would have been struggling.After talking to the vet later she told me something which left me intears, because it was so moving, and as she said, was possibly very true.I was told that Ben had been ill for over two years, but it had not beenobvious to us, but once I had been diagnosed, he simply gave up the will tocarry on. In other words, he knew I was ill and looked after me, until I wasdiagnosed and on medication,I had been in the medication for around 6 months when he died. I never got over this, as he had been a close companion for nearly 18months while I was going throughthe diagnosis,never letting me outof sight, unless my wife was around. This broke my heart, because he was not just a dog, he was a big friend,too meThe odd thing was that after I had retired we had walked miles togetherand kept each other company, during the long days of the diagnosis, he waswalking slower but always alongside me.How can anyone say that animals are dumb and don't understand.I confess that I really miss not having an animal in the house, becausethey can support us in many ways these days.Not only that, but having a dog means that you must go out and take itfor a walk, which also means that you yourself get exerciseI cannot have another dog now, because it would tear me apart now ifanything happened.But I understand, that when you have a cat or dog, , they ask for nothing, but give you 100% unconditional affection and attention in return for a home and food.Life would be different without our furry friends, bless them",

WhenIwas young, the store staff added up your bill, usually on the piece of paperwhere it could be seen and checked, but those days have long gone However,these days many elderly people have never come across some of this technology,and in many cases, they may not want to use it. I confessthat I don't cope with the self-service checkouts very well, and tend to jointhe big queues waiting to be served by real staff, rather than a machine There areso many possibilities for using technology to keep you occupied or active, butI do worry that soon, it\u2019s going to get beyond the control of many elderlypeople, or those with a neurological illness.I supposethe day will come when doctors\u2019 appointments could be done via Skype ortelephone or even email, rather than face to face, and this will cause problemsto those who don't cope with technology very well Thesedays we are told to order our prescriptions, and arrange appointments over theinternet, however I get confused doing this, and my wife does not like it, sowe do it the old way by going to the doctor\u2019s surgery. Many elderlypeople and those with living with dementia etc, are using technology at home tokeep themselves active, in the hope of staving off the illness for a little butlonger.It doesworry me that technology is now being overused in many places, making itdifficult for elderly people and those with neurological illnesses to keep upwith constant changes.Lookingconstructively at technology, it's used so widely these days, that many peopledon't always accept its use. Years ago, there were many complaints aboutthe use of technology to track people with dementia. But inall honestly, everyone who uses a mobile phone istracked by a satellite,so if you can use a mobile phone and be tracked, why is it so wrong to use itto track people with dementia, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s for our safety,and isgiving us the freedom to do whatever we want, without needing fulltime carers with us.Thisgives us the freedom to do what we want, when we want, so we can live an activelife without social workers etc, or anyone else telling us what we can andcan't do.Buttechnology is far reaching these days, and some people would be totally lostwithout it.I usetechnology most days, whether it's my mobile phone, tablet computer, or whetherit's things like, the voice activated software on my computer, which is a greathelp on my bad days, when it's difficult to use a computer key board. This is agodsend, but it has its down side, because there are days when it fails torecognise my voice, so I must spend time going over the course again teachingthe equipment to understand what I am saying.This isoften seen as part of Parkinson's disease which is like Lewy Body Dementia. Thetone of our voice changes on a regular basis What doesannoy me, and I don't suppose I am alone, is the fact that companies keepchanging their websites, and this in turn makes life so much harder for thoseof us, whose brain is doing its own thing.

I guess it was more relaxing than working for the NHSBut this lady was a real professional who wanted to help her patientsI do think people need more support after a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's, because there is little or no support these days, it's still a post code lotteryIt's my own opinion that there should be dedicated dementia nurses, at the diagnosis, who can then go on to support a person and guide them through their problems.There also needs to be more support for our carers, because they have to start from scratch, without any help from social servicesWhat is more, they are saving the country hundreds of millions of pounds a year, with little thanks from the Government.A carers role is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, trying to protect us from coming to harm, and in many cases, without rest themselves.Along with this we should be getting more information about our illness at the diagnosis, as I did.This allows us the time to take the diagnosis on board in our own time.This information should also be kept up to date, because there are too many websites these days, which are out of date, and much of the information differs from other websites.While the news media are full of ideas these days, on how to stop us getting these illnesses, I do wonder where they get these ideas from, or whether its just a way of grabbing headlines and selling their rubbish newspapersAt the end of the day, if the specialists really knew what was causing these illnesses, or how to stop them, they would be highlighting this themselvesA few years ago, I was discussing Lewy Body dementia with a friend of mine, who has since died.We had both had Lewy Body Dementia, and had both worked on live electrical installations over the years, and we wondered if that was the cause, because its not exactly healthy working on live high voltage cables.There had been a lot of speculation in the media about high voltage cables and other illnesses like leukaemia.But I am sure if there had been anything in this, we would have known by then,However If you are going to get one of these illnesses there isn't much you can do to stop it, but by remaining active, it has been proved you can keep going for a lot longerAs one Professor in Neurology in the Northeast once said, we either \"Use our Brain or Lose it\".I have always remember that and it helps me to fight on, and I have no intention of giving in and stopping yet, because life is to shortHowever I do feel that's it's very important to get as much as you can out of life, and not think about what you have lost or are missing.It's about our pets, Families, and Grandchildren etc, and if you focus on them it takes your mind off your own problemsI know that it's not a bed of roses living with dementia, but with help and support from others, you have to make the most of a bad situation.I am only too glad that I have voice activated software and spell check on my computer, and this allows me to carry on writing my blog.I am sure that I would have given in by now, if it were not for these two tools, because I can say the words but have little idea how to spell most if them these days.",

When I was an engineer I could go and look at a job of work, then I would sketch it out, and measure it up, knowing that I could work from the sketches etc. These days it's all gone and trying to sketch things is very hit and miss.However I do still fight to hang on to using my computer and my camera, and although I can't always remember the settings, I am still determined to hang in a long as I canOther people have other hobbies, which vary quite a lot.I know someone who now carves walking sticks as a hobby, and that is amazing to hear about.I used to love wood carving, but these days, with lack of coordination, I am a liability when it comes to using sharp tools etc, so it's something that was stopped, although I still have my tools. But no doubt these will be sold off before I do any damage to myselfOthers go walking with groups, or meet other friends in pubs etc, where they have a good time.I do feel that it's up to us all to keep fighting for as long as we can, because the thought of giving up is a step too far.Some people like singing for the brain these days.

        "content": "Like many people, I find that life gets difficult, when you have more than one illness to think about, and this can cause extra problems with medicationRecently I was told that medication which supports us for one illness, can have the wrong effect on another illness which we may have So in more than one way, medication can be a fine balancing act I was diagnosed was having a form of Lewy Body Dementia, something which never made any sense at the time, but I knew there was something wrong, because I was losing control over my job. At first the doctors had thought it was something to do with Encephalitis or something like that, because I had been very ill with pneumonia, but then the diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia came out. But at the same time I was struggling to cope while working, due to tremors and memory problems, which was hazardous, as I was trained to work on electrical installations etc, and not the type of work which is easy when a tremor starts I also had what was thought to be industrial Asthma, although I don't remember any tests being done. However over the last two years this all changed, when I finally got a diagnosis of Bronchiectasis and Emphysema It seems that this all started when I was very ill with whooping cough as a child, and this Bronchiectasis damaged my lungs.This was made so much worse because of years of working in industry. After several chest infections a year, a new family doctor looked into my medical report and found that all of the chest infections were down to one infection which was deeply rooted in my lungs, and which refuses to go no matter what they throw at it. I have found that after two weeks of antibiotics, I can be clear for around 8-10 weeks, and then it all seems to start all over again which is frustrating.But during this time I had been told to use my inhalers more often than usual, so i carry one in my coat pocket these days. I also have an emergency pack of antibiotics, which I carry when I go on holidayI also used a nebuliser to help my breathing and clear my lungs on a morning. However this has now been stopped because one family doctor thought that the nebuliser medication was increasing my tremors. It's very sad when this happens, but I guess it's all a learning curve, but the fact that the tremors got a lot worse, was enough for me to stop using the nubuliser all together. The nubuliser had been a great help to me, but on balance the tremors were so bad last month that there really was no option These tremors can be distressing at times when I can't hold a knife or fork still at meal times,. So I tend to eat using one hand, while keeping the other hand out of the way. Medication also causes problems with the Lewy Body Dementia, because the illness makes you sensitive to certain medications as I have found over the last few years. I struggle with occassional graphic nightmares etc, and I was given medication to control it, but this caused more problems in the beginning, and had to be cut down to a manageable dose. So it's a delicate balancing act when it comes to medications, but luckily most doctors are aware of this problem, although there are some doctors who don't always check before prescribing medicationHowever most medications are changed every so often if they don't seem to be working, and this causes extra problems with my memory, because I have to remember what to take and when.Along with this, I don't always remember how many times I have used things like inhalers. My brain just does not work remember things like this all of the time and that's distressing. ",

To today I heard that the Chelsea Pensioners were writing to groups running firework displays, asking them to think about people with post traumatic stress, from military action. While I don't think many people will take any notice, I confess that I cannot really understand what these people may be going through when they came home injured from war. But they must be so mentally scarred, that these noises bring back many unwanted nightmares of war zones. Trying to live with the nightmares and horrors of what went on, and trying to rebuild their lives, while others set off these very large fireworks around them..However it's not just troops, we must also think of or pets and wild animals, along with our elderly and those who are seriously ill with perhaps heart problems.While no one wants to spoil anyone else's fun, I guess we have to consider others in these groups, because some of these very loud fireworks or landmines as they are called can frighten many others ",

However the results were were from questions my wife asked before we started, and the faces of the students,\u00a0 when I explained some of\u00a0 the problems people with this illness face on a daily basis. If I remember correctly How many people have been touched by dementia in their families?How many had heard of Lewy Body Dementia?How many knew about Robin Williams and his death?Many seemed to know about his\u00a0 Parkinson's, but did not seem to link the Lewy Body Dementia to his death and problems I do feel that after talking about this,\u00a0 it later became obvious that many people did not recognise the problems he had struggled with, because some seemed to be shocked at the symptoms which appeared in this illness. I guess many were shocked to hear about Robins death but never looked at why or how he died.Some possibly heard of Michael J Fox who has Parkinson's and is still active in the Parkinson's field, and this possibly threw them But I guess that many people including medical staff, don't look at the cause of a person's death, but we're are all different. I only picked it up due to my links with Lewy Body Dementia, when Robins wife spoke out about it.

I am not capable of noticing mistakes or repeats any more, so she is also my editor and advisor, as well as secretary, driver and arranger.I am not sure how long this will last, as I have struggled a lot more this year, but I am prepared to give it a go, knowing that If I get stuck or tired, my wife can carry on readingShe did a few years ago at St James Park football ground in Newcastle,\u00a0 when I was unable to attend a conference I was due to speak at, due to a chest infection.\u00a0 This also gives my the opportunity to talk about Lewy Body Dementia, something which many know very little about. Many people have never heard of this form of Dementia, but knew about the\u00a0 Robin Williams story, so it's easier to explain things around Robin and one or two other people who have lived with the illness. However I do feel that these sessions are very important to all going into the NHS, as it prepares them for dealing with problems associated with dementia.

Last week I heard a very heated discussion among a coach party\u00a0 about how aluminium causes Alzheimer's. But does it.If that's the cause, why is it that everyone who used aluminium pots and pans in the 1950 1960s,\u00a0 did not go on to develop Alzheimer's. I do feel that the media are feeding people's brains with this sort of unfounded rubbish, just to sell their papers etc.I do think that it's time newspapers were stopped from writing lies about illnesses, because they are only making things worse for those living with the illness Quite a few years ago I met someone who was to become an old friend.\u00a0\u00a0 He was also dignosed as having Lewy Body Dementia,\u00a0 and we spent many hours discussing some of the media speculation.Along with this we spent time discussing our jobs at the time, both\u00a0 of which had involved working on live high voltage electrical distribution boards. We both wondered if this had in some way caused our problems,\u00a0\u00a0 because there is so much unknown about the effects of working on live electricity, apart from electrocution, if you make the slightest mistake In my office we also had a base station for two way radios, which other people carried around the college, and I used to get horrendous headaches at times. This was put down to the radio frequency,\u00a0 and the fact that the walls were lined with some think membrane. So little is known about these two way radios etc, and it's like mobile phones.I understood that the government hid a report on the dangers of using mobile phones when I was working,\u00a0 and this in made much worse when you are on a busy street,\u00a0 where there are lots of Chinese people etc. You never see one of these people with a mobile phone stuck to their ears, it's always in front of them well away from their ears. So do these people know more about the effects of mobile phones on our brains than we do, or are they more cautious than we are in this country. However dementia has been around a lot longer than Aluminium pans or mobile phones, so I guess no one has the answers to these questionsWhich ever way it goes, we are all going to die with something, so why don't the media leave us all alone, unless they have real medical evidence.",

It used to take me a long time to draw and plan carvings, yet these people\u00a0 created all if this stunning work without the education\u00a0 etc, we have these days. After a short talk about it's history, we were allowed to wander round to take in its history. I confess that these days with chest problems,\u00a0 I struggle when the air is dry and feels full of stone, so I went outside to look around.The chapel was briefly mentioned in the book and film By Dan Brown in\u00a0 \"The Da Vinci Code\", and this in turn made the chapel known to millions of people around the world. After this we travelled to Edinburgh where my wife and I went to Hollyrood House or Palace as it's often known by. This too was amazing to see, and we intend to go back when we have more time.The following day we went for a drive around Loch\u00a0 Lomond and the Trossachs taking in the stunning views.I have always loved\u00a0 this area and have spent many holidays here, as well as having our honeymoon around Stirling and Perth. On our final day we travelled to Dumfries House, a very large stately home which was saved by The Prince of Wales and a group of trustees when the owner died, and it was going to be sold off.This was a lovely house, and although we did not have a lot of time there, it was well worth a visit.From here we travelled to Ayr for lunch and sightseeing before heading back to the hotel After this we arrived back home again on Friday afternoon, feeling very tired. We met quite a lot of interesting people in our coach party, and in some ways it was sad when it ended, but it was a taster for future visits. Scotland is such a beautiful place, and I could happily stay there, because the scenery is so stunning, and always changing. ",

I was told last year that its illegal to ride a bicycle on a footpath if you don't have a bell, to fitted to warn others using\u00a0 the footpath, but many simply ignore this law. What is more, if you try to say something to these people you get a mouthful of abuse. However I do think that disability scooters need to have bells or horns fitted when used on public footpaths During the last few days I have seen two mobility scotters travelling\u00a0 along busy footpaths, dodging other people walking along looking in shops. I think this sort of thing is now getting worse because these\u00a0 scooters can travel at high speeds, and when you have problems with stability,\u00a0 these things are very dangerous, as they don't give you much of a chance to get out of the way. A few Years ago I wrote to Durham county council about these mobility scooters and was told it was up to the Government to do something. So I wrote to the \"Government department mentioned\" and was told that it was up to local government to control these things. So does anyone care, especially when people are being run over and injured by high speed scotters on footpaths.\u00a0 The problem with these things is that many of the users are not insured for accidents I think that they should be regulated, especially on footpaths and even some users agree, because they get fed up of abuse from pedestrians.I understand that some able bodied people use them, to save them walking everywhere which seems rather odd, especially in this day and age when we hear about people being unhealthy or obese As one disabled person said the other day, you can always tell if someone really needs these things,\u00a0 because they usually have walking sticks or cruutches strapped on behind the seatI have no objection to people using them, but I honestly think they need regulating, and they should be insured for any accidents they cause.

Like everyone else I get a little down at times, but I think this week I hit the bottom and found it difficult, to get clear of it. When this happens I usually go for a long walk, or as far as I can walk these days, which is not far compared to years ago when I could walk 15 - 20 miles a day. These days I\u00a0 am lucky it I can manage 3- 4 miles with my hip and chest problems, but I know that it's exercise When you struggle to cope with stress and agitation, as I have found recently it's difficult to get on with a normal\u00a0 life. Trying to find the right words when talking to people, can be a hazard times, something\u00a0 which many people don't understand, but I guess that's life and we have to find ways of coping with it. I have at times found myself staring into the distance unable to think clearly, and this can't be good. Sometimes it feels as if I have hit a brick wall, because I can't think what I want to say, even to my wife, and that is very hard. It's not that I don't want to talk, the words just don't come to my brain However I have noticed some days when my brain has not been connected to my mouth, as the wrong things come out, or come out in the wrong order\u00a0 and that's embarrassing. I spent an odd day on my own at our caravan, and coped quite well, because I knew where everything was, so just pottered around relaxing\u00a0 and enjoying walks around Barnard Castle which is lovely. The only problems came at meal times when I had to work hard to plan things out.I guess the reason I like this area, is because of its gorgeous countryside and everyone speaks even if you don't know them at allWhile I don't always cope well on my own, I find the caravan to be relaxing because it's smaller than our house and I know where most things are. As well as that, the air is a lot cleaner in Barnard Castle, than it is around home so it helps my breathing problems. I guess some of my problems could be due to lack of sleep.Although I can drift off during the day when my eyelids get too heavy to stay open,\u00a0 which is an odd feeling, then wake up after half an hour or an hour feeling totally refreshed I confess that I have never had this feeling until recently,\u00a0 where you feel as if your eyelids are being pulled down and even fighting it can be a waste of time. During the night is totally different, due to the bad dreams and nightmares, and waking up with a cramp in my right leg and foot.I have never suffered from cramps like this before, but they can be frustrating. So I suppose a few good nights sleep may well help, if I am lucky However after this week I have a vague idea about what depression is, and it's something that I need to watch, because I don't want it to get worse or so bad that I can't handle it.

However many Doctors don't tell you the problems you could face, if you are in a similar position, and need to take these drugs in a regular basis.It took a new part time family doctor who also worked in s hospital,\u00a0 to explain, that when you are taking these antibiotics for the likes of chest infections, you need to take extra precautions, because some of these can have an effect on your skin etcThis doctor wondered why I was having so many chest infections, and spent his own time going through my notes, and found that all if my chest infections were linked directly to one deeply rooted bug in my lungs. I was told to keep my head covered, and to try to keep the sun off my face as much as possible, because I will burn much\u00a0 faster than I would without taking antibioticsWear sun glasses to protect my eyesKeep my arms covered as much as possible Most of this causes total havoc at present with the weather in the UK, because you never know what the weather is going to be like. With this in mind you may end up carrying a lot of extra things around with you, and you have to consider what may happen The other day we went out on a dark cloudy day expecting rain most\u00a0 of the day, so I did not take my sun cap is sun glasses, and guess what, the weather changed the sun came out and it got hot. All of which proves that in this country you simply cannot believe the weather forecasters I hope I get this next piece rightTake Bio live yoghurt everyday, when you take antibiotics, because antibiotics kill off natural bacteria living within your stomach. The live Bio Youghurt contains live bacteria which allow your stomach to work normally. Although many of us use sun creams, which to me are all the same, we need to be using strong sun creams which may cost more money, but it's certainly well worth it for you own protection. The problem with all of this is, that when you have memory problems, it's difficult to take all of this on board, while also remembering what to take and when.I am always forgetting to take Bio Youghurt, or totally forget to put the sun cream on before I go out. Not every doctor tells people to protect themselves from Antibiotics, because many don't understand the problems caused. Quite a lot of doctors don't understand chest infections, as I found to my horror over the years. Especially one who said that I just had a common cold, but told me to send a sputum test straight in for tests. Three days later I was told that there was an urgent prescription waiting for me, with antibiotics for two weeks? My wife and daughter have said that they know when an infection is brewing because my attitude torally changes, and I become aggressive. So the next time you are given antibiotics ask your doctor about the precautions you need to take. ",

        "content": "During the last few weeks I have been staggered by the number of totally unfit people who are out driving on our roads, and no one stops them With this in mind I have brought back this old blog because do feel that it's time that the laws are changed..Over the years people with neurological illnesses have been stopped from driving, because they were thought to be a hazard to others. Rightly or wrongly whichever way you look at this, I do feel that these people were victimised because of their illness, while others were allowed to carry on regardless.Having looked around these days, it is fairly obvious to many that the laws need changing, because there are many people driving, who are unfit to do so.In this day of free bus passes for the disabled and elderly, I do feel that the law needs tightening up to remove others from the road, and not simply pick on those with nuerological\u00a0 illnesses.I have seen many people getting into or out of a car, when it's fairly obvious that they are struggling to stand up let alone walk safely.These people have usually been the drivers too which is hard to accept.The number of people using two crutches etc, to stagger along a footpath, who then get into a car and drive off. People especially elderly who get out of a drivers seat, in town centres looking totally confused, possibly because of memory problems etc. I have seen quite a lot driving with neck collars on, when it's against the law these days to drive like this, more over, you are not insured, because you don't have full use of your neck. Years ago I had a problem with a trapped nerve in my neck, and the hospital sent me to another hospital for traction.Nothing was said at the first hospital, because I had walked there, But the ward sister at the second hospital told me off, because I had driven there as my wife was looking after the children, and the bus service there was very bad. In her words, \"you are not insured if you have an accident \".Yet since then I have seen many people driving with these collars on their necks, including bus drivers.However I do wonder why there is not a mandatory medical test for all drivers from a certain age, to ensure that they are safe to drive.It's been suggested a few times that this should be automatic at the age of 70, yet this causes a lot of heated debates amongst those of that age,\u00a0 many of who ignore the fact that their responses or eyesight etc,\u00a0 is not as good as it should be. Many county council's in the UK, run driving assessment schemes which cost \u00a320, a small amount to have your driving tested to ensure that you are still fine to drive.Before this is picked up wrongly I am not saying that everyone over 70 is unfit to drive, because many clearly are, but there are others who are not fit to drive. I personally think that the family doctors and motor insurance companies should work together, and sort this out before too many people are killed. While I no longer drive, some drivers terrify me these days, because it's obvious that many are totally unfit to be on the roads, yet nothing is being done to sort this mess out.I was in a country village the other day, and saw two elderly drivers go past the bus stop, both hanging tightly onto the steering wheel and peering over the top, eyes nearly closed as if they could not see clearly? It alway sounds as if it's someone else's problem, and not the medical profession or the legal profession.It's time to stop banning people with nuerological illnesses from driving while others who may be more dangerous are allowed to carry on regardless. I do feel that these regulations are hit and miss, a bit like a post code lottery,\u00a0 and they should be standardised, so that we are all on a level playing field ",

But like other people, I know that this is easier said than\u00a0 done,\u00a0 on some days. I was originally told to set up a routine, after my diagnosis in\u00a0 County Durham.This idea is that it makes life so much easier, getting things done during each day. However as i have found out on many occassions, it only takes a small distraction at the wrong time, and then things go haywireI have used the same system over the years, yet things still go wrong, especially if you are in a different environment or if you have visitors I have tried having settings on my mobile phone for my tablets,\u00a0 but this again relys on you being in the right place at the right time.I have been distracted on many occasions, and this can be frustrating if you have forgotten to take your tablets in time etc. However there are other times that it can be embarrassing. I was once getting shaved when something happed. Later that morning my wife said she looked at my face,\u00a0 and saw that I had shaved one side of my face, and not the\u00a0 other ? Luckily for me I dont have a dark beard to it was not so obvious There have been many occasions when I heard my phone alarm go off, but was not ready for my tablets,\u00a0 or I was still eating etc.\u00a0\u00a0 So I say I will take them shortly, only to come back later and find my tablets still in the box untouched This even happens when I have the tablet box in my pocket. I have on many occasions got out of bed after a bad night, and the routine has gone out of the window. It does not take a lot to throw things out of gear like this, just a slight distraction either a noise like a door bell or telephone, to someone asking you something. I guess one way would be to set up a reminder on my phone, but reminders sometimes get in my nerves at times, especially if you are eating and you get a text etc. I then find that I turn off the sounds and then things go completely wrong.\u00a0 While reminders are good to keep us going, there are times when they are impossible to stick to, and that is more frustrating at times. But having a routine is very important, because it allows us to have that extra bit of freedom,\u00a0 without needing support from others all day ",

        "content": "When I read the guidelines for stopping or halting dementia the other week, I was left feeling as if something wrong, some where along the line It's taken me nearly two weeks to think this through, because I was unsure whether I had read and understood\u00a0 it properly, but now I am ready to commentBefore this all started I was very active and walked quite a lot during each day, on top of doing my job. I found a note the other day in an old diary, where I walked or cycled\u00a0 around 10 miles each day, sometimes 15 miles to and from work, yet a doctor giving me a medical examination, said that this was not being active enough. I dare say many doctors don't walk that far each day.My brain was kept active, because as a college engineer, I was always busy if I remember correctly, either planning, estimating, or doing something else which kept the brain active. I was on call for breakdowns, and when I got home we were usually found in our allotment garden,\u00a0 growing vegetables etc. Like thousands of other people, I don't understand or see how I got this illness. How can you go from being active, as well as running two budgets, doing estimating etc, to counting on my fingers? Like many other people, living with this illness, we can't get the answers to these questions No one really knows what causes dementia, but there are many people who think that they can tell us how to remain free from ever getting dementia? Including many in the media. But if that is the case, why is it that thousands of people in the UK alone, are diagnosed with this horrible illness every year. These comments in the news a few weeks ago, upset quite a lot of people living with this cruel illness, because it's fairly obvious that those writing these comments, neither had a lot of experience in dementia, nor are they living with it. Looking at this the other day, one\u00a0 person I knew, commented that after reading these notes, it made it sound as if most of us had been lazy or inactive all of our lives, and rather unhealthy?There was also a comment about why, \"the large dementia charities\"did not pick up on these silly guidelinesAs one person with dementia said one day. Any fool can write guideliness about an illness, but unless that are living with that particular illness, they don't really have the experience to write about it.It's a bit like health and safety regulations.\u00a0 If you have not been trained to do a certain job, you can't possibly write out the regulations? I confess that after reading the guidlines I felt exactly the same. Dementia has been around many years, yet our grand parents ended up with it, even though they never stopped working, from early morning until last thing at night. Many of these people never drank alcohol etc, either,\u00a0 and had busy lifestyles.So I do wonder why \"so called\" experts tell us that by being well educated, keeping active\u00a0 and eating well,\u00a0 stops you getting this terrible illness. It's not so very long ago that we were told that our grand parents ate lots of foods which were unhealthy? Yet when you look around these days, it leaves a lot to be desired seeing all of the\u00a0 wall to wall fast foods etc consumed every day. I have even heard of academics etc ending up with the illness, so no matter what sort of lifestyle you have, you are capable of getting this illness. So let us hope that in future people think carefully before writing things like this. I also hope that the media stop using \"this illness\" as a way of selling their newspapers etc. ",

        "content": "Over the years I have had many problems with my eyes, yet the Eye specialists don't seem to recognise what is going on.Many don't seem to understand neurological illnesses, like Parkinsons/ Lewy Body Dementia etc, all of which it seems can cause eyesight problems I never really understood whether my problems were down to the eyes alone, or whether the brain and eyes were not working together.As someone said the other day, the brain recieves messages from the eyes etc, so it's down to how the brain uses these messages. I guess that's why I sometimes look at a road sign, shop sign, something in a book, or on television, and say the wrong place or word.I wonder if its all down to my brain is telling me the wrong thing. This is very disturbing at times, although I try to laugh it off, but it can be serious In some ways this explains my problems with moving staircases and marble floors etc, because the brain is getting the wrong messages, or is changing the messages it receives.Things like blurred or double vision can be disturbing, but it seems that they are part of Dementia and Parkinson's etc, including Lewy Body Dementia.The Eye specialists always seem to do one thing, and that is to fit your glasses with prisms to correct the double vision, because they don't realise that the problem is nuerological, and can be intermittent. I have had prisms fitted to my glasses before, but had them removed because my problems are intermittent, and after a while I get a pain in the eyes.Besides which, this glasses with prisms cost a lot more than normal glasses, so it gets very expensive when you have more than one pair of glasses Yes it's difficult, but I prefer to shut one eye, and then open it later when the problem clears. Things usually go haywire when I am too close to something or someone, then I see doubleI often joke about which \"wife\" I am going to kiss, knowing full well who it is, but I am seeing double. However I wonder just how many specialists consider the fact, that we don't always remember things that happened But people , in a myself can't always remember when something started, or how long it went on for, or stopped, so we cannot always tell a specialist what they need to know It's no good telling people to write notes, because it's not always possible to remember to do this So when it comes to eye tests etc, we cannot always describe things as they happen, as well as we are expected to, because of our inability to remember things clearly In many ways it's a double edged sword, because your brain, eyesight and memory are working against each other This in turn has an effect on your abilities to plan things out carefully each day, Even though I have had this on and off for 10 years, I get round it by closing one eye, and this works. Prisms only make matters worse because the double vision is not permanent.There has been a lot of discussion about eyesight problems in people with dementia, but it appears that the problem is worse than the authorities seem to think.Our eyes are important to us all, but when things are not recognised on a daily basis in makes life very difficult.",

        "content": "I know they say you should never look back to things you have lost, but there are times when I feel it's not a bad thing, because you understand the important things you have still got left in your life However I still don't understand fully how I got to this stage.I had been an engineer for 28 years running the maintenance department etc, along with two large budgets, as well as doing estimating, and electrical work.Then things went off the rails so to speak.When things started to change during my diagnosis, I had no idea how long it would last, or what would change in my life.The answer to the first question was given by my consultant in County Durham, \"How long is a piece of string\". In other words, as my wife explained to me later, until we know, the correct type of illness, and how long the illness is going to take to progress, we cannot tell.We were also given a sheet of paper, with possible symptoms and problems which I could be faced with, but I guess nothing prepares you for the challenges faced after a diagnosis like this.Nor can you imagine the changes which you could be faced with, but I guess this is because at this stage, you have already started your journey and don't really understand what may or may not come your way. At this stage my daughter was expecting, but I had no idea whether I would see my grandchildren grow up or get to know them.I am now blessed with 5 lovely grandchildren from my son's family and my daughter's family, which is a blessing on it's own, and I have to hang onto that as a positive. Children can brighten your day up, although the noise can be hard to cope with if they get excited However while I realised that I could no longer remember how to do my Job as an engineer, like electrical work or do estimates, I never expected other things to disappear from my memory. How can you go from running two large commercial budgets, and estimates, to counting on your fingers? I can look at something many times, and yet never see the obvious and that is hard to accept. How can you keep missing things which are so obvious and under your nose? I think the worst part early on, was realising that things were not always as they should be, but I also think it was realising that I am no longer in control if my life. It sometimes feels as if my brain has a life of its own, and I am no longer in control of things. But I suppose our brains are in control, and without them working properly, we would be useless, but this does not always helpRealising that I am always making mistakes, which would have embarrassed or annoyed me years ago, yet I can't do anything about this. There are days when things like big numbers, and words , don't mean a thing to me anymore, and it's hard to work out why I don't remember them anymore Yes there are days when I see a number and realise what it means, but these days are running out, or seem to be Its very hard, when things work one moment, and the next moment things are total rubbish I know that things change quite a lot with this illness, so I can't always plan what I want to do a few days in advance, Trying to read a book can be a mine field, because these days I simply don't understand some words any more, so I have to skip them. But then I hardly remember what I have read away way, whether this is a good thing or not, I am not sure. It has positives because I can read some books again and again, but still don't remember the story So it's my good times when I will attempt to write anything, or use social media, but these days are running out, due to mistakes that I don't always see when writing.I dread going out at times because I often say the wrong things and that can be distressing, because it's usually the opposite to what I meant to say. This often causes upsetting times with my wife at home, when it comes out wrong, but I dread to think what other people may think.My grandchildren seem to make allowances these days, although I think they understand that I make mistakes, as part of the illness.There are times when it worries me, just in case I say the wrong things in front of them Understanding everything that's going on around me at times can be distressing, because I quite often misunderstand what is going, on or what has been said I get annoyed at the television, then my wife explains that I picked it all up the wrong way. This also happens in conversations, when I misunderstand what has been said, and then answer wrongly Marble floors can be a total hazard on a bad day because I see things that are not there. I know that it was all explained to me a few years ago, but it does not help when your brain tells you something else. I guess it's all down to the brains view of what it's seeing, which could be totally wrong in all reality. Things like moving staircases can also be a hazard, because I am never sure when to get on, and if I stand in the wrong place when going down, I end up being pushed by the rising treads. All this adds to the pressure to get things right, and in turn adds to the agitation ",

        "content": "Many of us had people caught up in the First World WarThis was well known as the War to end all wars My Grandfather was in the Durham Light Infantry, and\u00a0 had left home to fight for his country A few years ago my wife and I went on a coach tour, and we were able to visit Ypres and Passchendale where my Grandfather fought alongside his friends etc. This in many ways explained some of what had happened, but it was so very hard to understand the horrors of this war. I read my Grandfathers diaries before they were lost in a flood, and they brought tears to my eyes. He had left school and got an offer of work in the local coal mine where his family lived, but decided to sign up to join the army, to fight for his country, because like others, he felt it to be his duty A lot of his friends also signed up, because they had been told that they\u00a0 would see the world, and they were also told that the war would be over before Christmas ?When I think of this, I wonder just how many young men would do this these days. He had been injured by shrapnel and was brought home to recuperate before going back again.When he went back, he heard that many friends had died in the gas attacks, and this left him distressed because he felt he should been there. On his return he got the offer of work in\u00a0 the local mine again, but this never lasted along because of his injuries He had changed from the happy young man, to someone who would spend hours just walking in the countryside, or sitting deep in thought.I wonder just how many coped with the horrors they had seen in thoughs few short years.I guess as a child I knew someone who had hidden nightmares of this horrible war, but he would never ever talk about it. He was a man who always seemed deep in thought, but he would never talk about this, to either myself or my mother. He would often take me to local cricket matches in our town, or we would spend hours walking across the countryside. Looking back , I\u00a0 wonder if these long walks, were places where he could\u00a0 listen to wild life and think of the horrors that he had escaped from.Perhaps it was a way of proving,\u00a0 that he could walk without being shot at. I suppose the long\u00a0 walks and listening to wildlife was a way of reassuring himself that the war was truly over even though his nightmares were still with him He would often explain what bird made certain noises etc. But this hid the real man who was still struggling to cope with life, and I guess that wildlife was a life line, and kept him going. From his diaries I often wondered if he had felt guilty about coming home injured but alive, when he had lost so many friends from his village. To me he was a giant of\u00a0 man, and so gentle, but I can never imagine what was going on in his mind. I miss him a lot. My wife's Grandfather was also in this war, but we never heard anything about him after signing up, and nothing was ever said God bless all of those who live with the memories of this horror, and those who lost loved ones.",

        "content": "Last week I noticed a news topic about Traumatic Brain Injury and Dementia, and posted it on my blog.This is a topic which has concerned many people over the years, but no one seems to know whether there are any links or not, so I guess the jury is still out on this one Taken from an old blogIn the late 1970s, I fell around 15 feet and hit my head on the ground, and vaguely remember lying on the ground thinking that my head had exploded before I passed out. I don't have a clue as to how long I was out, but somehow managed to get up off the floor and staggered back to the office to see my boss,  and then went home, where my wife took me to the doctors Later that day, I had the mother of all headaches, and was takento hospital, but after a few x-rays, I was sent home.My wife said that the doctors did not seem tooconcerned, because shehad rushedme in by carrather than calling an ambulance The hospital that night was also very full, of people waiting to be seen, and these two doctors were rushed off their feet. However sometime later, I wasasked by a different doctor, whyI had notbeen sent for a scan to look forbrain injury, but it appears that this never happenedThe following day I looked like a panda according to my wife, as I had two enormous black eyes, and a headache which felt as if my head was splitting open. After contacting the hospital, I was told to take paracetamol. A few years later I drove through a set of traffic lights, and had no knowledge of what I had done, which was very distressing because my young daughter was in the car at the time.I had driven for two miles, but had no memory of having done this at all, however after speaking to our family doctor, I was then referredto our local neurological hospital and hada lot of tests, after which I wasdiagnosed as having absence seizures, which caused havoc at work, because of my electrical work etcI found myself restricted in everything I was allowed to do.When the Lewy Body Dementia was diagnosed around 10 years later, we were told that there was no sign of me ever having these seizures which came as a shock.This left me a little concerned, as I could not understand how you could be diagnosed as having something, and then the same hospital department overturned the original diagnosis.We were toldby one doctor,that it could have been the Lewy Body Dementia in its early stages, something that another consultant later over ruled. Last weekLast week we had some friends staying with us, and this topic raised its head.I was amazed to hear that thisold friend had, had the same experience years ago, and has had seizures etc which are now controlled, but also has dementia. Her husband and my wife were talking about the day after each accident, when we had both woken up with huge black eyes? Although we had not met at the time of our accidents and they were not linked, it was strange to hear this, after all of these years.I was on medication for two years to control these seizures, and had beentoldto stop driving etc, and take things very easy, because a bang on the front of the skull could be dangerous. Whether there is a link between TBI and dementia, we may never know, but only time will tell, but I have heard of many people who had head injuries who went on to get dementia. These days we are hearing quite a lot about sports personalities like rugby and football players going on to get dementia after head injuries, so I am starting like others to ask if there is a linkCoincidence or what?",

While I am not in this position, of living with a terminal illness, I do in all honesty think that there is far too much red tape connected with this along with far too many so called gooders getting involved If someone has something like motor neuron disease or rapid form of cancer etc, and there bodies are failing, I don't understand why they should not be allowed to die with dignity, rather than fighting to the bitter end.In all honesty, we would be prosecuted if we allowed an animal to suffer in similar conditions, yet humans are expected to carry on struggling.I do feel that the guidelines stop unnecessary premature deaths, yet many people think it's wrong to stop fighting an illness. I know that there are Christian groups linked with stopping people from dying early when they have had enough, and to be honest it's time they allowed people to make up their own minds. Many of us have set up guidelines for the end of our lives, and I see nothing wrong with that at all because it was discussed between my wife and I.

Surely they should be looking for the true cause, rather than using drugs,I know that there are times now when my brain goes,\u00a0 and I am no longer able to think or plan things as I was used to, and this is upsetting, because it's very hard to accept or understand.I have often been accused of frowning these days, yet there are times when I\u00a0 have no real\u00a0 idea when I am smiling, unless I can look into a mirror. Facial expressions don't mean a lot to me anymore.It's not easy when you are not I control of these things,\u00a0 and sometimes it's embarrassing. Things like reading and understanding letters and documents can be an experience, because I don't always understand what I am reading or seeing. I often misunderstand what people are saying these days, and this in turn causes upset, until it's all explained properly. But I think this is my brain working things out wrongly This causes mistrust between people, but unless you to have been there you would never understand it. These days it takes me longer to work to things out, or try to carry on doing\u00a0 normal things, and have to resort to items such as voice activated software on my computer, so that I can write my blogs etc. But I guess over the years we have all said, that we feel totally depressed, but it's only when things go wrong and you cannot workout how to correct them. It's a phrase which can cause a lot of trouble these days, especially if you say it to the wrong person, like an uncaring doctor When I was first aware that things were going wrong, and had not been diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia, all I got from the family doctors was that it was depression Yet the job I was in, there was not enough time to get depressed, as I worked 24 hours a day doing breakdowns. Yes it was hectic from what I can remember, but it was a job I loved.I did not always get a full nights sleep, but my employers always said, that when the chips were down, I stepped up a gear to get the breakdowns or power failures sorted out.Perhaps other people would have simply become stressed or depressed,\u00a0 but I enjoyed my life, until I could not do my Job anymore. I guess that because I could not remember how to do estimates and electrical work anymore,\u00a0 and ended up counting on my fingers, which was distressing But in this case who wouldn't be depressed, it was because I was losing control over my brain and thought that I was going mad. I do feel that life has been turned on it's head, in more ways\u00a0 than one, and things are no longer what they seem, and this causes me at times to feel depressed, but as with memory problems etc, I have to fight it for my families sake. But I do feel that we need more support for depression or the symptoms of this illness to stop it getting any worse I don't remember in all honesty hearing about so many suicides as we have these days, but if we are honest there is not the support out there, that we should have. We also have Government who don't care about anyone but themselves and that does not help. Let us hope that in the future we get more support for those in need, before it's too late.While I openly admit to getting depressed at times, I do have ways of trying to deal with it, and turn things around. Yes it's to do with losing control over my brain, but that's life and I have to hang on to that and help others wherever I can.I realise that I am starting to lose control of my photography quite a lot these days,\u00a0 but I will just have to find something else to do and be positive I have my family and grandchildren and they are more important to me.

So today I have been signed off from the chest clinic, and any future problems will be dealt with by the family doctor.While this is a good thing, I am left wondering if I will get a doctors appointment\u00a0 of I ever need one.Last time we tried my wife was told that there would be a three week wait, so if things went wrong I would end up in hospital. I do have an emergency pack of antibiotics at home\u00a0 just in case things go wrong, and I need to take them on holiday so that I am covered if I get another chest infection. I guess its all down to us keeping an eye on my chest problems, and hope that I remain free of chest infections for a bit longer, possibly until the winter time, when we know that they are bound to return again.I am now feeling positive about this now, so I am hopeful.

No one seems to have any idea as to why these things are unused at all because of the shear size.These statues can also be seen on the streets around town centres, and many people are spooked by these, but I guess thus happens when your brain is not working as it should do.

This is not just a tax on dementia, but a tax on all who have any terminal illness, and I think many people will now be nervous of what's coming. I can only hope that charities stand up and campaign against this, in the hope of stopping it getting off the ground.This may only be the\u00a0 first step, and health care may well be cut back even further in the future, as the country seems to be in a financial mess which can only get worse,Sadly this government has told so many lies about the state of the NHS and the numbers of Police officers etc, I think we may all be in for a rough ride over the next 5 years.This country is reportedly wealthy but all of the money is going to those who are well off, not to the normal working class people who are paying more tax than ever before.Most people in this country are worse off these days due to all of the cuts, and I fear it could all get much worse, the longer we are controlled by this right wing Government I can understand them wanting to cut benefits, but they should have hit those who have never worked in their lives, and not the disabled or terminally ill.I have come across many in my life who have never worked, and had no intention of working, because they are well off with all of their benefits, and that to me is very wrong.

But as my wife and I found at the Launch of the Strategy, there was no new money going into the project, it was money already in the NHS. This answer can from the Government Health minister at the time, and I confess that we were staggered What is more, this money was not ring fenced, therefore hospitals could use the money for any project they wanted Many people worked on this project over the years, and all had high hopes that it would succeed, but obviously the Government at the time had other ideas.Over the years many groups have had meetings about improving services, but I am left wondering where the money went.While some services had improved, I do feel that we should have seen more improvements around the country by now.Like everything else in Dementia, it's down to the post code lottery, where, if you live I the right area, you get better services This Strategy period has now finished and no one in the Government seems to be interested in a new National Dementia Strategy.All they talk about now, is what we are calling the Dementia Tax, something that I and many others find to be a total insult in this day and age.This is not just a tax on dementia, but also on all those with a terminal illness, people who may well need home careSo I do wonder if a new Dementia Strategy will ever happen now, because this Government pledged to spent millions on mental health last year, but this money never appeared anywhere.I know that the cross party committee on Dementia is focused on improving the lives of those with the illness, and as someone who spoke at the launch of this I feel very proud, that they are still doing so well.But I do feel now that the country is in such a financial mess these days, that things may well get worse before they improve.However to put a tax on dementia or terminally ill these days is discrimination, towards those who have been inflicted with an illness they have done nothing to attract Dementia like other terminal illnesses are devastating enough without Governments making life worseDementia is not self inflicted, and I have to ask why people like myself are being hitHospitals are full these days of people who get drunk every weekend, and then need hospital care. These people are not taxed, and they will possibly go on to have major health problems in the future.The Health Service Problems were caused by this and previous Governments, who failed to make sure that there was enough money in the system.To me it seems that if the NHS is in such a mess, the next Dementia Strategy will never get off the ground, and the previous one is doomed to end before much longer.I do feel that we must start asking our Members of Parliament or those asking for our vote, what they intend to do about the Dementia Strategy and the Dementia Tax? Your vote counts, so please ask your MPs about this illness and the NHS",

This can occasionally\u00a0 lead to me getting frustrated and agitated at times,\u00a0 because i cannot get the words out, or think or the correct words, when i need to,\u00a0 and sometimes the conversation changes so fast that it's a waste of time.This means that fast moving conversations and topics can be very hard to keep up at times, because you think of questions but are not allowed to interrupt until it's too late, by which time it's all forgottenI understand that this is all because it takes my brain longer to process things and to get my thoughts together these days, and consider my answers.This usually means that by the time I am ready to speak the topic has moved on,\u00a0 and this in turn can lead to agitation which can be embarrassing and upsetting. Yet when I am giving a talk or presentation in a large room with lots of people, it does not seem to bother me. I guess that's because there is only one person talking at the timeI noticed this a few years ago, but thought it was just my memory playing up at the timeThis was discussed on friday at a balance clinic which deals with Lewy Body Dementia and Parkinsons It seems that my planning is not as good as it used to be, and this also means it takes me longer to work out normal things these days After being shown a Parkinsons Disease fact sheet it all started to make sense to me, because it seems that it's part of the illness.There are times when the tone of my voice changes and that can be frustrating especially when you use technology to assist you in doing tasks like computer work. I had also realised over the last few years that my voice changes from day, and sometimes every hour, and this in turn causes problems when using voice activated software on my computer. One day it recognises my voice and works, while the next time it does not recognise my voice and does not work Parkinsons If you have Parkinson's, you may find you have some problems with your speech.People with Parkinson's may find that they have problems with different kinds of speech and communication, including facial expressions, writing and finding the right words to express their views For example, your speech may be slurred, your voice hoarse, unsteady, or quieter than it used to be. You may find it hard to control how quickly you speak or you may find it difficult to start talking.People with Parkinson's may find their voice sounds monotonous. These problems can make everyday activities difficult, such as talking to friends difficult This is something I found a few years ago after listening to a recording of my voice. It had changed a lot since I was working and I could not believe that it was my voice I was listening too, and felt like deleting it allTaking the lead in conversations may e challenging at timesTaking the lead in a conversation or presentation can be very challenging at times, but I have learnt to write things down in advance, so that I dont get confused or Lose the plot,\u00a0 ",

        "content": "Over the years I have been amazed at the lack of interest, the church of England has in people with dementia, memory problems or parkinsons etc,Many people grew up as members of the Church of England etc, and now feel like outsiders, because they are largely neglected by the church these daysI had started going to church from a very early age, then joined the Church Choir at the age of 8, and carried on going, until my memory went haywire However as a person who grew up in a Church of England family,\u00a0\u00a0 I find it staggering these days, that the church has so little time, or respect for people with memory problems etc. Yet these people,\u00a0 are usually the ones who try to attend church regularly, and pay into the church plate every week.Yes many Churches have had dementia friends events,\u00a0 but as a person who is religious, I know that is as far as it goesWe are tolerated, but not accepted in most churches.I have spoken at many events about this subject,\u00a0 but in all honestly I don't feel that the church thinks enough about people with these nuerological illnesses.Many of the\u00a0 clergy I\u00a0 have seen at events, dislike comments against the\u00a0 Church of England, but if they cannot take on board constructive criticism, then to me they are in the wrong Job. We all grew up with the fact, that no matter what our religious views or beliefs were, we were all equals in this life There are thousands of us around the UK and the world, living with an illness that we have no control over We are\u00a0 just as religious as those who attend church every Sunday, but these days many like myself have simply given up the will to go, because of the constant changes in services and lack of respect I once wrote the Bishop of Durham, explaining my problems with the changes of service, coupled with the fact that I sometimes struggle with very graphic nightmares during the night.I then explained the fact that I don't really go into a deep sleep until around 4-5 am. After this sort of night, I am not what could be called a morning person, because it takes me time to get my brain into gear. He promptly wrote back telling me to get up and go to an 8am service on a Sunday mornings, where they run the old forms of service. So had he read the letter correctly?, or simply ignored the problems I and others face with this illness. After that I decided that it was a waste of time trying to write to anyone within this establishment, because they were not interested in dementia or people with memory problems. But I do think that when churches etc,\u00a0 hold dementia friendly days etc, they should make sure that they have people with the illness there,\u00a0 if not running itPeople with this illness do not gloss over the illness, they say it as is, from their point of view. I know that we are all so very different, but that's life. This is a vast difference to hearing about dementia from staff or volunteers, because they are not usually living with the illness, where we are There are hundreds of variations of dementia, and all are so very different, with different symptoms and problems. I once heard of a Church of England curate telling people that he thought it was a total waste of time and money, going into care homes to do servicesIn his view they all sat there and never took part.But I do wonder if he realised that many with this illness live in the past, and remember the old forms of service, with old hymns and prayers.They don't go in for changes to services, with modern songs which are sung over and over. They need to be assured that services will be a simple and realistic as possible, with no long winded sermons. It's just no good expecting people who grew up with old services to learn new services.It's very upsetting when you grew up \"saying\" the Lords Prayer, then find that you have to sing it.When I lost my job because of memory problems, I also lost the ability to remember the Lords Prayer, and I was devastated, as I had known it off by heart since an early age I worked at this for months and then decided to return to church, only to find that the words were totally different, and not only that, but they changed every week, and sometimes sang it. My wife spoke to the clergyman in charge but he just said, sorry that's life. From then on I lost the will to go back. We are supposed to be living in a Christian Country,\u00a0 but these days I am having serious doubts about this. After this we found a book of short church services, in a charity shop. This was written for people with dementia etc, and it's ideal, because everything you need is there. ",

But if it was not for the savage cuts to Council Budgets, we would not be in this mess in the first place Social care is now mainly run by Private companies rather than our own council services, so it's going to cost a lot more They also forget that most of the care at home is done by family members,\u00a0 with a little support from outside, and that includes the \"Government\"There are better ways of cutting costs these days, but for some reason this Government does not want to look carefully at where cuts should be made.\u00a0 They are hitting the vulnerable in this country and that is awful, considering we are supposed to be a \"Christian Country\".\u00a0 Dementia like other Nurological illnesses is not self inflicted, therefore we have done nothing to get this illness, yet we are being victimised by the Government\u00a0 While social care costs a lot of money, I think the terminally ill\u00a0 are being held to ransomMy main concern is that some people who are living with Dementia etc, may wish to end their lives, so that their families are not left with huge debt or living with the fear of losing their homes\u00a0 While this\u00a0 tax appears to have been stalled at present,\u00a0 the Prime Minister says that she is going to look at it again once her Government are back in control after the election, so this must mean that she intends to push it though at any cost at a later date. I do wonder if this so called Christian Prime Minister has any idea about the terrifying pressure she is adding to those living with Dementia or any other terminal illness now.Her actions are certainly not the actions of normal\u00a0 caring Christians, and I do wonder how she can enter a church with a clear mind on Sundays We now have a general election, and it's up to everyone to vote, to protect the sick and elderly who have done so much for this country The choice is yours please make your vote\u00a0 \"count\"\u00a0 but please stop this tax on the terminally ill because it's disgusting and very wrong ",

We have also seen the savage cuts to county council budgets, which in turn hits things like social care Over the years many councils run\u00a0 care homes have been allowed to close down, so that they could be run by private companies, this in turn is just another way of hitting the sick and elderly It's my view that care homes should be provided by the health service and should be open to all.By doing this we could make sure, that hospitals are not clogged up by people, who should be at home, but don't have the support and backup. It's my own personal view, that those who have worked and paid their taxes in full, should be looked after properly no matter what age they are. Whether we like it or not the National Health Service was set up to provide health care for all, no matter what age they were or what illness they had. If that means the NHS running care homes and social services, then so be it But please stop blaming the health service problems on the elderly everytime we seem to be running out of money, because it's all down to very bad Governments. If we look at it carefully the \"NHS\" is not just doctors surgeries and Hospitals as the Government keep implying, it also covers thousands of people working in big office blocks, with little to do with hospitals, yet these people get big pay rises every year, unlike nurses etc, The NHS is full of these\u00a0 quangos of little groups of people,\u00a0\u00a0 throwing money around as if it's their own. The problem is that no one has any idea how many Government Quangos are hiding within the NHS, but they are cost many \u00a3millions\u00a0 These groups were all removed under Maggie Thatcher because they were a waste of public money, yet the last Labour Government under chairman Blair and the Tory Party have brought them all back. It's these other people within the NHS, who are using and wasting the money meant for hospitals etc. Over the years it has been quite obvious that Governments in the UK are taking money from one pot and using it for something else, just like the car tax, which I gather is used to paid benefits. For years the British Governments have lied about the state of the NHS, and have not ring fenced the money, and then allows it to be spent on something else It we are to look after things like the NHS, then we need to stop wasting money on unless projects like HS2 / Cross Rail etc, and start using the money wisely It is reported that these two projects are costing the UK nearly \u00a3100 Billion We must remember that the elderly have\u00a0 hard all of their lives, and as I said paid their taxes in full, and many others have served the country in the armed forces, therfore they should have priority over others who have not paid taxes in full.However doctors are getting better at diagnosing and treating many illnesses these days, and while that's a good thing, with better treatments etc, come higher costs, especially in hospitals These days we are seeing more and more cases of self inflicted problems which need hospital care and treatment,\u00a0 including those who regularly go out and get totally drunk, and then end up needing extra hospital care. To me these people should be charged, because many of them end up being abusive towards staff and other patients..So we must look at the problem as a whole and stop blaming the elderly every time for the high costs.

        "content": "6 weeks ago I got my final diagnosis of Bilateral Bronchiectasis and Emphysema, and my medication was changed. The only problem was that the clinic was running one and a half hours late, so there was little time to discuss medication changes.As well as my normal ventolin and Symbicort 400, I was put on a Spiriva inhaler once a day and mucus capsules which break the stuff free of my lungs each day When we went to see a family doctor, I felt as if I was wasting my time, as she really did not want to discuss my medication changes because, in her words, the hospital consultant should have done it.She also got rattled that she was expected to do my prescription, because she said the hospital should have done it.I asked what order I had to take the extra inhalers, but she did not say, and did not even look them up. In passing she said that once the new spiriva inhaler and mucus tablets started working, I would not need to use my ventolin inhaler as much, and in all possibility I should be able to cut it out. In the end we had a long talk with our local chemist, who was disgusted,\u00a0 and said that the ventolin was the most important inhaler, because it opened the lungs, and allowed the Spiriva and Symbicort inhaler medication to get right inside the lungs. I always had two ventolin inhalers, one left at home, and one in my coat pocket where ever I went, but this has now been cut down to one.Yesterday the weather was heavy and I felt terrible, as if my chest was being crushed by a large belt. This left me wondering whether to use the ventolin at lunch time as I was originally told, or try to do without it. Originally I was told to use the ventolin 4 times a day, when I was struggling, so I guess I need to ask the specialist when I see him next. I am really looking forward to discussing this with the chest consultant early next month, in the hope of getting somewhere. ",

These people are largely ignored in many cases as drop outs, but they are real people with real stories to tell. These days many of these people\u00a0 seem\u00a0 to be immigrants trying to find their way in society, however there are still lots of people, who may well have lost everything in their lives, and are fighting desperately to get some sort of regime and routine back.Unless you have been in this position, I don't suppose you would ever give them a second thoughtI confess that I was a little naive until I started to read this book, and then found it hard to put it down, because it was compulsive reading. I knew very little about the \"Big Issue\",\u00a0 although I have probably read about it in the past, and then its disappeared from my memory like many other things.But the idea of giving people a role in their lives, providing they are willing to work at it,\u00a0 is amazing, and I will never look at these sellers again in the same way.We all deserve a second chance although many never get this.But reading about how Bob the cat, adopted and supported James was truly amazing. We had a cat and two dogs over the years, and I was always amazed at how they could detect when you are feeling ill or having a bad day.\u00a0 Animals have this amazing ability to understand human feelings, and I guess that is why they are used to support people who are ill, or have long term medical issues. They always say that a cat picks it's owner, because it's a very independent animal, and I belive that.I also understand that it's a very intelligent animal and resourceful, and won't allow you into their private space unless they trust and respect you. They say Men should not cry, but I confess I failed when I read these books, because of the emotion that these books bring.It's been a pleasure to learn about \"The Big Issue\" and how other people cope with their difficulties. Its also amazing how something as small as a cat,, can change things around It's not my type of book by any means, but it's light and has a lovely story behind it.Thank you James and Bob ",

The students have always beengood enough to send us personal remarks, after each talk and that does make itfeel as if it has all been that bit more worthwhile because, it also provesthat they too get something out of the talks.I can honestly say that thelecturers have been so supportive and kind, especially by giving me enough timeto consider the subject for my talks well in advance, so that I can spend timewriting it all out before the event.This must be one of the firstdementia friendly Universities in the country, and they should be very proud ofthemselves for what they achieved in the period.Well done to all of the staffwho do, so much to help train high quality nursing staff for the future",

        "content": "As an Ambassador for the Lewy Body Dementia Society, I will be going back next week to Northumbria University to talk to Graduate Nurses.\u00a0 It's been a while since I did this due to recurring chest infections and problems with diagnosis, but now that things are sorted out again, it will be good to start again, however I am not sure how long it will last.I realised that last time I was giving a talk, that I was struggling to breathe so it's going to be a case of waiting and see.The reason for the talks, is to get these graduate nurses to understand that people with dementia are normal people, it's just our brains don't always work the way they used to do.Yes we have our own individual problems, and sometimes get agitated when we are unsure of what is happening,\u00a0 or when we are out of our comfort zone.But if we are treated with respect,\u00a0 we usually\u00a0 get along well.I always say that everyone should treat others with the same respect, that they would expect from others around them,\u00a0 and nothing less. Respect costs nothing,\u00a0 and it's something many of us grew up with, and therefore we expect it from others. Nurses like everyone else in the medical profession get very little training in dementia, so this is one way of explaining things to them over the one hour sessions. Yes there are many negatives about this illness, as with other illnesses, but I don't always go there, because it gets distressing thinking of all of the things I have lost, like my job, and hobbies which have become too dangerous to do.I prefer to talk about how we all want to live as well as possible, with this horrible illness. Health professionals have very busy lives these days, so if they get an understanding of this and other illnesses, it may well help them in the future One thing they must understand is, that not everyone with dementia is the same. There are over 300 variations of dementia, and therefore no two people are the same. We are all individuals with , individual problems and symptoms.However this is a chance for me to explain about my Lewy Body Dementia Diagnosis.Because Lewy Body Dementia is totally different from other types of Dementia, due to the fact that people sometimes have hallucinations. We also have very graphic nightmares, which can be acted out, making it difficult at times to separate the nightmares from reality. Many of us have other problems too, and this has to be remembered. I have balance problems, along with Chronic\u00a0 Lung problems, and this has a knock on effect on our lives.Dementia is not easy to diagnose, but the same goes for other illnesses. When I consider that I was ill with chest problems as a child, but it's taken up till last year,\u00a0 to find out why I was having recurring chest infections. Over the years it was simply put down as working in industry or asthma, then they find out its much worse. I guess the same goes with dementia, because many doctors use different terms or names for an illness, and that in turn causes confusion and stress to us and our families Many people assume that once you get a diagnosis of dementia, your days are numbered, However,\u00a0 it's a well known fact that there are many people around the world, who have been living with the illness for over 20 years after their diagnosis It all,\u00a0 depends on the type and treatment given, along with the support you are given by the consultants So don't think that because you have seen one person with this illness, that we are all the same, because that is totally wrong ",

        "content": "When we moved from the mining village it was a shock to the system, because we moved into a new council estateYes we had an inside toilet, a bath and hot water straight running from\u00a0 the tap,\u00a0 a big garden and we were near to the town centre, but the people seemed to be different. I guess in a small mining village, every one knew everyone else, but in this new estate it was all so very different. People started having things like cars, or motorbikes and side cars. We had a playing field for playing games, but on a dark night it was more fun playing football and cricket in the back street, using a dustbin as stumps etc. If the ball hit the dust bin, there was no denying that you were not out, because everyone heard the bang However many of the locals used to object to the noise, and things would get out of hand if a ball\u00a0 went into someone's garden, then we had to ask permission to go and get it backYou simply just did not walk in and pick it up without asking.But one of the novelties we had, was the fact that the Great North East Railway ran past the front of our house. So it was here that I started train spotting because all of the big express trains etc,\u00a0\u00a0 ran up and down this line. This was before trainspotting books came out, so we used a sheet of paper to note all of the trains.If it was raining I was allowed to spot trains from my parents bedroom window, providing dad was not sleeping, but when it was fine, we used to sit on the trackside fence. This was pure joy.I like my friends then bought areal train spotters book, with all of the train numbers and names in, and things got more serious after that I guess in those days the book was paid for out of pocket money, and was bought by our parents.Not far away there was another railway line which ran from Tyne dock up to the then Consett Iron Works. These trains were giants, due to the very steep gradient they had to climb with the ore trains. These were the class 11F locomotives which were true giants in many ways.So if we were allowed to walk down to the next railway bridge, we got trains on two separate tracks, and that was pure joy.After this I joined the Parish Church choir and the Cubs, and from then on things changed quite a lot At this age I confess that I did not like school at all, because I was not really academic, and my brother was doing much better than I was. So it was always said by teachers, that I was not fit to stand in my brothers shoes. So I lost the will to fight on. It was after leaving school and going to college that I found my own way and did well for myself But in those early years I battled on and found my own way, even though the teachers thought I was a waste of space. I often look back and think, that I made myself into an Engineer, so to me that was one up on the teachers who did not like me. I ended up feeling very proud of doing so well at work and at college, even though my school days were not very goodHowever that was down to teachers who had other things in their minds and were not very good at their jobs as others people have said recently But it proved that in the right environment you can flourish and do wellIt's a pity that this illness came along and destroyed it all.

        "content": "After being at Beamish Museum a lot of memories started to come back, and the grandchildren thought some of them were strange and others were odd, or funny.I was born in a small coal mining village in county Durham, a village that was surrounded by moorlands or fells as we called them..Within the village there was one large deep pit coal mine, and three drift mines, which were sunk into the hill sides. The houses were basic, because they were owned by the mining company, but they consisted of two rooms down stairs, and two upstairs.There was only one cold water tap, and all hot water was heated up on the large coal range in the main kitchen / living room area, downstairs.\u00a0 The front room was for Sundays,\u00a0 or for guests otherwise, us children were kept out of it, apart from going through it to go upstairs to bed. There was no bath inside, we just had a tin bath which was hung on the wall outside the house when not in use.\u00a0 When needed, it was brought in and the water was heated on the range. The lighting was all gas provided by the mine. The toilet was in the back yard, here again no running water as we have thee days. The toilets did not have drains either, but were emptied out every so often, by a man working for the mine, who went down the streets with a horse and cart emptying each toilet out. That must have been an awful job.I often wondered what would have happened if the family were hit by a bug like diarrhoea and sickness, but these were few and far between because as children we were always playing in muddy fields etc, and there were few of the bugs around that we have these days.My father grew up in the same village and he was one of six children. So the downstairs rooms were a kitchen/ living room, and a front room which acted as his parents bedroomUpstairs the three daughters slept in one room, and the three boys in the other. Not a lot of space, but in those days you got on with life and accepted it.I have an elderly aunt living in the house where my father grew up, and it's strange to think that 8 people lived in such a small house. Next to the toilet was a coal shed, where all of the coal was shovelled in through an 18 inch hatch after it had been delivered. My mother always talked about me as a three or four year old, walking up and down the street with my little toy wheel barrow,\u00a0 loading it up with someone's coal from the street, and wheeling it back home, where it was emptied outside the back gate. She later admitted that they were very worried at one stage, because for some reason they started to notice that their cutlery draw was looking oddly \"sparse and nothing made and sense.In those days we had oilcloth on the bare wooden floor boards in the kitchen, and as you walked through the kitchen from the back door, the oilcloth was wearing thin and had split in places, due to the floor boards splitting and breaking at the edges. So my father started to replace the broken floor boards before replacing the oilcloth, and found all of he cutlery under the floor. It was then that they realised that I was hiding their precious cutlery under the floor, by pushing through the spilt oilcloth and broken floor boards. I honestly don't know what I was trying to achieve at that age, but our grandchildren thought that it was funny. Mum embarrassed but I was too young to understand what I was doing, and I was so small at this time, that I could not reach the sink. I guess we all did weird things as children, but I confess that I don't remember any of this happening When I was old enough I went to the Infants school in the village, which again was built and owned by the mine owners. It was here that I was taught the basics of writing and arithmetic,\u00a0 with a slate board and slate pencil. The screeches can still give me the shivers. When we first took the grandchildren up to Beamish Museum,\u00a0\u00a0 I told them about using those, and they looked at me in total disbelief, it was as if they thought I had been a caveman It was amazing watching these children using these slate boards and pencils.After this children went to the Senior school, which was around 1 1/2 miles walk across the fells, then the mining company put roads across the fells, which made it easier.Those were the days when few parents had transport, so you either got a bus or walked, and most people in those days chose to walk, unless the weather was rubbish The old Church and Chapels were\u00a0 built and owned by the mine owners too.The organ in the church was pumped up by hand, in those days,\u00a0 so playing the organ was a two person job. One playing the organ while someone else pumped it up, using a large lever at the side of the organ My grandfather used to play the organ on Sundays,\u00a0 and my father's brother, uncle John used to pump the organ up as a boy. He then took over playing the organ when grandfather lost his eyesight in a mining accident We grew all our own vegetables because the nearest town was two miles away, and the only large\u00a0 shop was a local Co-op shop, so it was a case of doing what you could. There was also a public house , a working mens club, a few small independent shops and a post office. But it was a totaly different life style to what we see today.There were no play grounds, you just played on the fells, and arrived back when someone decided it must be nearly time for your meals. This was made easy sometimes, because the mine hooter used to sound at the end of every shift, so we knew it was time to get back in before father came home. Considering wrist watches were not around in those days, we always managed to get home at meal time. As my Aunt always says, we used to go out to play after breakfast, and would return when we were hungry which was around 12 noon. Then we went out again and returned around 4-30. She always said that she was amazed at out time keeping. But I guess it was the same when they were children The moors stretched for miles, so we could be anywhere,\u00a0 but never got lost or into trouble The first public telephone box arrived in the village not long after we left around 1952. But these days children don't understand that we lived in houses without a telephone,\u00a0 running hot water, Electricity,\u00a0 Central heating or inside toilet What is more there was no television or radio, because there was no radio signal up there then. They look at the outside toilet at Beamish in total disbelief. As one grand daughter said at Beamish one Day?\u00a0 How did you get to the toilet when it was dark. We used a candle.Did you have spider's living in the Toilet?\u00a0 I guess there was, but it was so cold out there in winter that you got back inside as soon as you could I guess that this was the start of my chest problems, because it was then that I had Mumps measels and Whooping cough. I suppose a mining village was full of pollution,\u00a0 but I was far too young to understand that ",

        "content": "Over the last few years a lot of work has been done with Lloyds Banks making them dementia friendly, but now things are changingMany banks like Lloyds are cutting the number of branches they own, as well as cutting staff numbers down Although I am lucky to have very supportive staff in our branch at home,\u00a0 it's all changing If I go into the local bank, I am asked straight away if they can help in any way, because I sometimes struggle at times We did a lot of dementia training in the branches in our area, and thought many of the staff were supportive and went out of their way to help. But it seems that now, they are working flat out and don't have the chance to help as much as they didMany of the old members of staff, still come up to me when I am on my own, and ask if they can help. They also ask where my wife is etc.There are not the numbers of staff around anymore these days, and some of the staff have changed, so they don't know about me, and if I am honest I don't know them It seems that Banks are cutting staff to save money, but that has a knock on effect when there are big queues of people who may well be annoyed and frustrated at having to wait. This means that anyone else who has a medical problem, then ends up being put under more pressure, because they are not able to think clearly, and many people these days are not very forgiving when someone is struggling. I find it distressing when I am in a queue, and people behind start arguing and complaining, because my concentration goes completely But I think that this is down to people putting themselves first, and ignoring the rights of others.I personally feel, that no matter how much dementia training is done, it's going to fail in places like banks because their shareholders are in control.In the case of Lloyds bank, the general public still own it, and therefore they should think of the public first and not themselves. However it's not just people with dementia who will be left struggling when they go into banks, its people with many other\u00a0 illnesses, but I do wonder if the banks really care these days.It's all about the shareholders and nothing elseSo has the dementia\u00a0 training in banks been a waste of Time?\u00a0 I guess only time will tell, but it's not liking too good at present, and if they keep cutting down on counter staff as they are doing now, it's going to fail.

        "content": "Dementiaand Hospitals Thiswas written a few years ago but it\u2019s still very relevant today I do feelthat hospitals can be very frightening for most people, but when Dementia isadded it becomes a nightmare for those with the illness and their carers.I havenot had any experience of dementia in General Hospitals, but in 2001 when I wastaken in to hospital with Viral Pneumonia, and I experienced something that wasenough to put me off going near a general hospital ever again. This allstarted when I was admitted at tea time and was given an unmade bed. Around anhour later I was given a drip, and was then told by a consultant that I wouldbe having an x-ray. At around 11pm, and still without a made up bed, I wastaken for an x-ray, after which I was told that I could go to bed.Howeverwhen I returned to the ward there were no staff present, so I had to attempt tomake the bed on my own, with the drip in on arm. To add insult to injury, thenext morning, the young staff nurse complained to me about the state of my bed,and said something like; I should have found a member of staff to make the bedup.Later onthe second night, I was then transferred to a different hospital where theydealt with chest infections, and after two days noticed that the lady cleaningthe toilets was also rushing back to serve meals? This did not give me verymuch confidence, as the toilets were dirty, and I had to clean one before usingit. The bathsalso had air beds in them, so you had to take them out to get a bath.I complainedto one young doctor who said that I would possibly get better faster at homethan in those conditions. A fewweeks later the same hospital was given warning that it would be closed if itwas not cleaned up. But by then I was told that I had released myself from thehospital so the doctors did not want to know anymore. It took a long timebefore we were able to explain it all to our own GPSo inmore ways than one I was lucky that I did not have dementia at that stage, as Icannot remember how I managed to get my pyjamas on that night. So just imaginewhat would have happened if I had dementia at that stage.Manyhospitals are still not dementia friendly these days.Dementiacauses many problems when a person is admitted into a general hospital, andtherefore the carer should always be consulted.We hear alot about when someone is admitted to hospital or a nursing home, and this isusually made worst by the fact that neither, the nursing staff or the doctorsunderstand that the person has dementia, or what dementia is. Sadly, this islack of training, and this has to be looked into before things can get better.There are also many posters and signs on the wall which act as distractions,leaving us struggling to find the right information, so it is very hard to findyour way, and this is made worse by the lack of understanding staff, who arealways in a hurry to do something else, and don\u2019t really want to be involved inhelping someone with this disease, as we are in many cases treated as aliability. Yes wemay make mistakes at times, but this is caused by something, which is out ofour control, and is not deliberate. Getting lost in unfamiliar surroundings is very normal and expected when peoplehave this illness, so please don\u2019t send someone to a different department ontheir own as they may well panic or never get there. Many hospitals are notdementia friendly, as all the corridors, and doors are the same colour, andmany of the signs are in the wrong place. Many of the wards look the same, soit is easy to get lost or go to the wrong section.Sometimes the toilets are difficult to get out of due to the types of locks andthe very large mirrors, which give you the idea that there are two ofeverything and it is sometimes difficult to work out what taps are real andwhich are reflections. It iscommon for people with dementia to see things which are not there for others tosee? We see things in floors and wall decorations which can relate to somethingfrom the past, or from common nightmares.We justhave a disease, but we are normal people, who just happen to have a brain thatis doing its own thing. However, to most people we look normal we still havetwo legs two arms and a head, but that is because dementia is not somethingthat can be identified the same as a broken arm or leg, it is all in the brain. Asmany people have said to me in the past, \u201cYou don\u2019t look as if you haveanything wrong with you\u201d. Do we need to walk round wearing a band on our heads,saying we have dementia? Imagine if you were to lose the ability to say theright word or understand what is being said, e.g., when on holiday in a foreigncountry where you don\u2019t speak the language.You mayfeel frustrated, angry and look for help, perhaps someone to interpret for you,or help you find the right words.You mightrespond by not speaking at all and withdrawing into yourself or avoidingsituations where you have to communicate with people.In somecases this is what happens in dementia, the only difference is that, it is your\u201cown language\u201d that you do not fully understand, and that is upsetting andstressful, especially when people think you are being rude or disrespectedbecause you use the wrong words at timesA personwith Dementia may also feel under pressure because they cannot cope, withdifferent and unfamiliar areas, as well as they used to, but this is becausetheir brain is taking longer to process the information in front of them. Many already also have poor hearing which canbe made worse by their dementia, and they may not understand clearly what isbeing said to them, some people become frightened by too much noise or like mefind that their hearing has become acute, which can at times make lifeunbearable. Next time you have a hangover, just think that the extra loudnoises you struggle with after a party are for real in those with dementia, andit is not due to alcohol.Some people have LewyBody Dementia etc, and struggle with very graphic nightmares, and it\u2019s difficultto work out the nightmare from reality during the night.If someone is goingthrough one of these, please don\u2019t get too close, in attempt to wake us up.Stand aside and speak to us quietly.Do not attempt to shake usor get too close otherwise. You could become part of the nightmare and couldend up being hurt.We don\u2019t want to beaccused of assaulting staff when we are not in control, so please take this onboardThere is one factor that we all agree on, and this causesmore distress than anything else and that is noise, so please try to find somea place where there is no background noise, such as people talking, Radio or TVnoise, as this is distracting.Many ofus develop daily routines as a way of keeping control of our lives andindependence and if these are stopped or interrupted we may get frightened,because we are not in control, so please allow us to stick to these routines,otherwise everything falls apart, and we forget things like taking ourmedication or getting washed.Treat the person with the respect that \u201cyou\u201dwould expect from others, as like it or not we are the same as you, butwe are struggling to come to terms with this illness as well as losing controlover our lives, and many tasks that were easy are now very hard, if notimpossible to cope with. Manypeople with dementia also act in very different ways, this is due to the factthat there are so many variations and no two people are the same, or have thesame symptoms. Treat theperson as you would have done, before the dementia, we may have this illness,but in many ways we are the same as you, we are all human.Don\u2019t patronise us by trying to answer the questions you have justasked us, give us a chance to answer them, as in many cases we just need timeto process the information before giving you the answer.Try to speak clearly, carefully and slowly and where possible, face to face,so that we can understand you, and attempt to pick more of what you are sayingto us, as your accent may be hard to understand, and like it or not, trying tounderstand a strong accent, as well as the questions, is difficult for anyonewith dementia.Try to speak in a calm voice and not get agitated otherwiseit makes those with the illness react in the same way, then we are accused ofbeing aggressive.So please do not discuss our problems with anyoneelse while weare there; as it is hurtful anddisrespectful, we have ears and a tongue, so we can answer back ourselves.Many losethe ability to read properly and understand what is written down in front ofthem, so they may need someone like a carer to explain things. So please do notexpect a person with dementia to understand something like a consent form,because we may as well be signing our lives away. This alsomeans that when a consent form needs to be signed, it should be done in frontof the carer, who can explain it all in normal language, in other words, notmedical jargon as we still get these daysAccident and Emergency Department,  can be frightening these days, when you see the drunk and abusive patients sitting around.To me these people should be made to pay for treatment if it happens on a regular basis, and they should be banned from entering any hospital if they have been abusive. I don't cope with drink and abusive people these days as I panic and want to get away from them, and I guess that I am not the only one with this problem.Allow plenty of time for the person to take in what you say and to replyTry not to confuse or embarrass the person by correcting them bluntlyUse questions which ask for a simple answerDon\u2019t ask questions which test their memory, e.g., who am I? or what didyou say yesterday.Allow plenty of time for the person to take in what you say and to replyTry not to confuse or embarrass the person by correcting them bluntlyUse questions which ask for a simple answerDon\u2019t ask questions which test their memory, e.g., who am I? or what didyou say yesterday.ActionsSpeak louder than WordsTalk about familiar people, places and ideasUse the surnames of the people you are talking about, instead of \u201che orshe\u201d.

        "content": "This weekend we wentto a Dementia Cafe in Barnard Castle and really enjoyed myself.My wife had suggested that we go, as we were staying at our Holiday Static Caravan in Barnard Castle, and the memory Cafe was around a mile away.I have been to many of these dementia Cafes, but always left feeling it was a waste of time, but this one was totally different. I guess that it was different for a few reasons, but one reason was that everyone there was so friendly, and ignored the fact that we were not really from the town. Most people we see around the town speak, and that's something I find unusual, these days. But everyone we see going into, and out of the town centre treat us like locals, and either wave or speak as we pass.This is what I call a very friendly town, and certainly a Dementia friendly town.The town where we live these days, has changed from the town I grew up in, andapart from neighbours, no one speaks.But the interesting thing about Barnard Castle, is the fact that there are lots of things going on for both carers and people living with Dementia, and that's a wonderful sign these days.While many areas of the country, are suffering from savage cuts, this area seems to be bucking the trend, and have lots of services.I do think that this is down to the local staff and volunteers, who seem to be more switched on. However I really love being around Barnard Castle, seeing all of the wild life during the day, and hearing the owls in the trees outside our caravan every night. I know that there are two owls most nights and it's so nice to hear, even if I am on my own, because it feels as if I am not alone.I think they are Tawny and Barn owls, but I am not sure.However Barnard Castle like our own town has become a rat run for cars and lorry's, and the County Council don't seem to be interested in doing anything.I guess that by burying their heads, they thin that if they ignore it for long enough, it will all go awayHowever most of these councils who claim to be dementia friendly, simply bury their heads and don'tconsider the fact that people with dementia and other Neurological illnesses, struggle to judge traffic speeds and distancesMany drivers going through town centres never consider these people either, and just think that they are, silly people who walk across a road without looking.I am sure that more needs to be done to ensure that councils take this on board, rather than simply saying they are becoming dementia friendly",

This is all confusing and hard to understand,\u00a0 but when you have memory problems it causes havoc, because remembering to take all of the medication at the right time is causing total havoc While I did smoke earlier in life , I did not smoke a lot, and stopped after a doctor told me that I would not live to see my children grow up. That was enough for me to give up there and then.Admittedly I was doing other jobs as college engineer,\u00a0 such as working on oil fired boilers, which had to be serviced quite a lot.

Many buildings had asbestos panels in places too and I guess that it adds up.However I now understand that's it's made much worse by things I worked with in years gone by, like wood dust, asbestos, fumes, and pollution to name but a few.Pollution is worse these days than it was ten years ago, however it should have been a lot better, but for incompetent Governments who refuse to accept the obvious I must question whether garages etc, really test for pollution coming from cars or indeed trains and heavy goods vehicles these days.I say this because it's been noticeable, the number of vehicles on the roads etc, which are pumping out pollutants, so how do these vehicles pass a test in the first place There was also the VW scandal which faked emission regulations just to sell cars.\u00a0 Everyone expected the Government to demand compensation but this never happened.This was the only case we heard of, but I often wondered if other vehicle manufacturers faked emission tests and got away with it. Perhaps we will never know until it's too late. It seems that everyone else in this country has to campaign for cleaner air, in the vane hope that someone inside the government will take notice and do something I never ever thought that I would see the day when school children would be issued with face masks to help protect them from pollution.Is it going to be a case, that our grandchildren children etc, will grow up with damaged lungs, through all of this pollution we are seeing these days. I don't know about anyone else, but that thought frightens me, just the fact that we as a nation could be poisoning the young children at schoolMany schools also have busy roads running past them, and this is wrong.To me it's time that the school inspectors measured the Polution around these schools, and forced Councils and the Government to do something positive about it. These days like many thousands of other people, i have to learn to pace myself, so we don't get overtired while trying to get on with a normal life. However this is a struggle trying to pace myself, because my brain is telling me where I want to be, and it's not easy when you are sometimes gasping for breath. While I have problems,\u00a0 it worries me that our grandchildren will group up in a heavily polluted country, unless someone stands up and try's something positive to clean this country up very soon I have a Breezometer app on my phone and this alerts me when the air quality is getting bad. Today while I was out at a garden centre with my wife, i realised that the air quality was starting to drop, because I was struggling to breathe, and the alarm on my phone kept going off.When we got home the air quality had dropped to 36 out of 100, and I was gasping to breathe. I can recommend this app to anyone who has breathing problems, because it gives you warning and allows you time to get inside where you can take it easy.In this day and age we should not need gadgets to warn us about air quality, but sadly many would be lost without them ",

        "content": "I went to a Dementia Cafe in Barnard Castle and really enjoyed myself.My wife had suggested that we go, as we were staying at our Holiday Static Caravan in Barnard Castle, and the memory Cafe was around a mile away.I have been to many of these dementia Cafes, but always left feeling it was a waste of time, but this one was totally different. I guess that it was different for a few reasons, but one reason was that everyone there\u00a0 was so friendly, and ignored the fact that we were not really from the town.\u00a0 Most people we see around the town speak, and that's something I find unusual, these days. But everyone we see going into, and out of the town centre treat us like locals, and either wave or speak as we pass.This is what I call a very friendly town, and certainly a Dementia friendly town.The town where\u00a0 we live these days, has changed from the town I grew up in, and these days apart from neighbours very few people speak. But the interesting thing about Barnard Castle, is the fact that there are lots of things going on for both carers and people living with Dementia, and that's a wonderful sign these days.While many areas of the country,\u00a0 are suffering from savage cuts, this area seems to be bucking the trend, and have lots of services.I do think that this is down to the local staff and volunteers, who seem to be more switched on. Barnard Castle has a slight draw back, like Chester le Street, and that's the high volume of traffic passing through However I fear that the county council are ignoring the traffic, in the hope that it will all sort itself out, if they ignore the problem. Whether we like it or not, many people living with Dementia and other neurological illnesses struggle to judge traffic speeds and distancesIt may be nothing to councillors, but it's life and death to a person living with this illness. Durham County Council has always claimed to be dementia friendly, going back to when I spent a day in county hall talking to all of the councillors. But in all honesty I don't think that they are remotely interested. However I really love being around Barnard Castle, seeing all of the wild life during the day, and hearing the owls in the trees outside our caravan every night. I know that there are two owls most nights and it's so nice to hear, even if I am on my own, because it feels as if I am not alone.I think they are Tawny and Barn owls, but I am not sure.",

        "content": "After the news in the media during the last few days, I think it's time that elderly people had their eyes etc tested on a regular basis.Failing that I do feel that the DVLA should insist on all\u00a0 drivers from a certain age, being required to have a fitness to drive medical. This is turn could be linked into your insurance, so that you get a premium if you are fit, and the insurance is blocked if you are unfit.It seems there are far too many people on the road who are unfit to drive, yet no one stops them until it's too late, or when it's obvious that they should have been stopped, by their own family\u00a0 or the medical profession. People with dementia etc, have to report their condition to the DVLA, \"Driving and Vehicle Licencing Authority\" after which they can lose their driving licence, or they are required to reapply for their licence every year, and this is supported by a letter from the persons doctors etc While most if these people accept this advice and move on , many simply refuse, and carry in regardless of the consequences I also think that it's time that doctors stood in and contacted the DVLA, rather than leaving it to their patients.While the doctors surgeries may be overworked, they have the DVLA forms in their surgeries, and could get the practise manager to send,\u00a0 it once it's been completed by a doctor.\u00a0 The other day it was in the press about an elderly man, who carried on driving even though his eyesight was bad. If a doctor refuses to contact the DVLA themselves, they are leaving themselves wide open to accusations of allowing an unfit person to drive, however too many of them hide behind patient confidentiality, so something needs to be changed. While in reality,\u00a0 it's up to the patient themselves to contact the driving authority, many simply refuse to accept there is anything wrong.I do feel that the doctors are possibly irresponsible for doing nothing.\u00a0\u00a0 However these days I do feel that those people who are being treated for an illness like dementia,\u00a0 are at a disadvantage, because their insurance costs go up once they are diagnosed, and therefore things need to be more balanced.\u00a0 To me the UK should adapt the European scheme, where your insurance stays with you for Iife and any medical problems are flagged up straight away This is because many drivers simply lie to officials to carry on driving, and that's too easy.

So\u00a0 I decided against taking it. There is a small bus which runs to the cathedral from the bus station on most days, but we had missed it, and as the next one was half an hours wait, I decided that we should just go before the cathedral got too busy. I enjoy being there because there is so much to see, and I never get tired of looking around as it's so big and full of history.Next time we go, I will arrange for a photographic permit, and may well have a day there, so I can pace myself. While we were there we saw a Cathedral stone Mason giving a demonstration of his work, and there were market traders selling local produce in the cloisters. I can recommend this exhibition to anyone visiting the area, as it's a beautiful cathedral, and the exhibition was stunning When we got home I was very tired and slept for nearly two hours.

We also wanted to ask a doctor to explain what the consultants letter meant, but it seems that this is a total waste of time. This proves that it not just hospitals in crisis mode but also doctors surgeries This also proves a point when it comes to overworked Accident and Emergency hospitals. If people cannot get an appointment at there doctors, they going to head for the hospital, and to me it's totally wrong. However I do wonder how many doctors surgeries are run solely by part time GPs these days. Most of our doctors seem to be part time, rather than full time so perhaps things are changing.No wonder the NHS is in such a mess. ",

Organisers are hoping to attract new membership and volunteers for the initiative which will offer advice and support to compliment medical treatment.The inaugural meeting of the South Lancs Respiratory Support Group will take place at the Douglas Bank on Woodhouse Lane from 1pm.                                                                                            Bob Parry, who has formed the group, has organised community support schemes for residents with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for many years. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to attract new members to accompany those who have been part of our previous groups. The meetings give people a sense of community to get out and share time with others with similar conditions.\u201dCOPD is an umbrella term to describe many progressive lung diseases such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma and forms of bronchiectasis. Mr Parry\u2019s groups - which are supported by the NHS -  have also offered assistance to residents who suffer from sleep apnoea, a disorder characterized by pauses in breathing or instances of shallow or infrequent breathing during sleep.It will meet at the same venue on the first and third Wednesday of each month.The borough has traditionally had comparatively high rates of lung disease due to its coal mining and cotton industry heritage although the number of cases has seen a steady decline in recent years.                                                                                            On a national level, a recent audit report claimed those suffering from COPD are being \u201cfailed\u201d by the healthcare system. Patients are regularly being admitted and discharged from hospitals on a \u201ccontinuous cycle\u201d, the latest National COPD Audit Programme report states.The report, from the Royal College of Physicians, found that 43 per cent of patients admitted were readmitted at least once in the three months following discharge - a \u201cconsiderable\u201d increase in readmission rate.They wrote: \u201cThe impression provided by the data is of a system that is not only stressed, but is ultimately failing COPD patients.\u201dBut the audit stresses there have \u201cundoubtedly been improvements in COPD care\u201d, with the percentage of patients dying in hospital decreasing. Mr Parry said he is particularly in need of a new member who can perform the role of group secretary. For more information contact 07591496900.

As one professor once said, there are well over 130 variations of this illness, and everyone is different. We are all individuals, with different problems and symptoms.Each year I do around 6 one hour presentations,\u00a0 as a visiting lecturer and that's good for me as well as for them.It keeps me active and keeping my brain ticking over, which has to be good all round.",

        "content": "This week I got the news that my lungs are in a worse condition than I expected.I had been told last year that I had Bronchiectasis, which was caused bychildhood illnesses, like Whooping cough, and mumps, and I thought that was bad enough.While I remember my mother talking about me being ill as a child with these illnesses, I never really understood what impact it could have in later lifeThese illnesses did the initial damage, and now it seems that I now have Emphysema, which was caused by the health damage in those early years, smoking and then industrial pollutants, asbestos,and wood dust etc.When I look on the internet these days, nearly all of the products we used, or were involved with, are now classed as hazardous, or in many cases cancerous, like many of the timbers in use at those times.I also did Wood Carving and Wood Turning as a hobby before I became ill in 2001, and I guess that as most of these timbers were hardwoods, and in some cases exotic timbers from foreign lands, it was asking for trouble anyway.Having said that quite a lot of timbers used over the last 50 years have been from foreign lands, and some are deadly when they get into the lungs, according to the Health and Safety Executive these daysMany British timbers could cause breathing problems, but I never associated them with my problems over the years, because I used a face mask on most occasions.But looking back the dust is also carried around on the other parts of the face which were not covered by the mask.It was well known that many of these face masks, were inadequate for the job which they were meant forIts only later in life, that you realise that some of these products can cause pneumonia and other chest problems etc, and it brings it all down to earthI confess that I don't really understand, what these two illnesses \"Bronchiectasis and Emphysema\" mean, because they both do different things to the Lungs, according to my daughter who is a biologistWhen I was given this last diagnosis,  the Consultants waiting room was very busy, so he really did not have time to discuss anything this time round.The last time I saw him, he spent a long time explaining Bronchiectasis to usHowever this time he said that because I have Broncheitasis already, I don't have \"COPD\", which is confusing because Emphysema, comes under the umbrella of COPD.However if I picked it up correctly, you can have both illnesses without having COPD.Looking around there is a lot of information about COPD and Broncheitasis, but little about Emphysema, which is very oddAs I am being referred for Respiratory physiotherapy sometime soon, we may get the answers we need, and then I see the Consultant again in JuneIts very strange, but last year I felt a lot worse than I did on the day of the Consultation, but whether it was because I am trying to convince myself that nothing is wrong, I am not sure.I know that I had paced myself on that walk from home to the hospital, which is around half a mile, so I may well be getting better at pacing myself these days, I simply don't know.It could also be to do with the fact that we had to wait for one and a half hours to see the consultant, so I had time to relaxI am now waiting to hear from the family doctor about the changes in my medication. However as this isbeing done by the Consultant, it may be few weeks before we hear anything, and then its trial and error to make sure that the medication starts to help me.I know in my own mind that the damage is done, and cannot be corrected, or stopped, but I guess its all down to me getting on with life as it is now, and accepting what has been doneI have a lovely family to think about, and that includes 5 lovely grandchildren, so my mind will be occupied for a while to come.From this point I will need to do something I have struggled to do for years, and that is to pace myself properly every day.But I know that if I overdo things these days, I simply sit down and go to sleep for an hour or so.It staggers me these days, when I see people working without protection equipment on.I do wonder if they bury their heads in the sand, but it's no excuse, because health and safety is more prominent than it has been for years.Recently I have struggled with pollutionwhen I have been out, and I guess that this is going to get worse, especially if we travel around, but its no good sitting down and thinking about it, life goes on and its a case of making a go of it.We never really appreciate our lungs etc, during our early days, and looking back over my working days, there was not thehealth protection that we see these days, you simply got on with your job as best as you couldIndustrial places are much healthier than they were in the 1960-70s etc, but in all honesty some health protection equipment in those days was so uncomfortable, that you either wore it or took a chance with out it.I worked on many building sites, where asbestos was being sprayed onto the ceilings above us, but you just got on with life. All we had in those days was a cloth face mask, and that's no protected from asbestosThere were no warning signs anywhere and no protection for those of us working below.I know that some employers did their best to protect employees, but in many cases it simply was no where good enough.My memory is worse than ever before, and perhaps in some way this has helped. However I have decided to throw myself into doing work promoting projects like the Lewy Body Society etc, to keep my mind occupied.This may also help me to do some good while I am still able to do so.I thought life was bad with the Lewy body dementia, memory problems, and the fear of what may happen in the future, but now its taken a different turn.",

I also like pop music from the 1950 -60s.My tastes in music have changed slightly these days, but while I still like classic music, I now find, that I also like things like Freddie Mercury and Queen,, along with Rick Wakeman, and many others that would have been classed as rock or heavy metal.Although these have been around a long time, it was not my sort of taste, which seems very strangeHowever I have noticed that although I loved to listen to classical music during the night if I wake from a graphic nightmares, I have had to remove some music for my I pod player, because it was causing more problems when I was asleep.My wife thought it could have been changes in the style or speed of the music, but sometimes it sent me into another nightmare.My tastes in food has changed quite a lot, something that I grind very oddBefore and after we were married, I always liked British food and never touched anything like a curry, whether Chinese, Indian or anything else.However these days, I love all types of curry, and what is more, the hotter they are, and the spicier, they are the better. I could eat them all day.Last time we flew to Turkey we were given lunch going out, and breakfast coming back, but somehow these got mixed up, and I ended up with a Thia curry for Breakfast?I confess that this was novel, but really enjoyed it. It was not a normal breakfast but it was very nice.But I simply don't understand how tastes change like this, as it simply does not make any sense at all.I now understand how carers get upset, when the person that they are caring for, refuses to eat the same foodstuffs, that they have eaten for many years.Obviously something has changed dramatically inside the brain to cause this, but I dont know what.My coordination has changed quite a lot too, and this causes many problems, so much so that many hobbies have been stopped.",

        "content": "Written over Christmas It's\u00a0 very difficult, when you are diagnosed with any serious illness, because you can sometimes feel all alone.It's also possible that you don't know where to turn for support for advice, or support. There are many websites around the internet for illnesses, many are dedicated to one particular illness or another,\u00a0 where some cover a few types of illness, like dementia.However not everyone can use a computer, let alone get access to the internet, so it becomes difficult.Sometimes local hospitals have information displays with leaflets. Failing that your local library may be able to help.Sometimes people would rather sit down and speak face to face with someone, rather than speaking to a person over the telephone, but I suppose that is because you are talking to a total\u00a0 stranger about your own personal health problems, and that can put extra stress on to you,\u00a0 or a loved one.If you are talking to a stranger you may well forget all of the questions you have, so which ever way you do it, you should always write your questions down in a note book.However my\u00a0 problem was, that I would write notes down, but would and still do forget to take the note book with me.I guess that is where local charity branches come into their own, because these places have dedicated staff who can help to talk things through.When I was first diagnosed as having early onset Lewy Body Dementia,\u00a0 our consultant explained as much as she possibly could about the illness, and then directed us to our local Alzheimers Society office.We were also supplied with sheets of paper explaining the illness and the medication, which we took home However there is still a great deal of stigma around this illness, and I have heard many people say, that they will not go near to an office with an, Alzheimer's sign\u00a0 outside,\u00a0 because of the stigma.I guess that goes back many years, but if you don't go in, you may never get that support , that you badly need.But it's worth remembering that, you are not alone, as there are\u00a0 thousands of people in the UK alone, with one type of\u00a0 this illness or another\u00a0 After that it's not a bad idea to join local support groups if there are any near to you, because then you get support from other people with the illness.We have to accept all of the help we can, and listen to others who have the illness, we can't do it alone, and it's foolish to think that we can. By talking about it you help others as well as yourself, so don't bottle it up After my diagnosis I was told to keep notes about my graphic nightmares, and other problems. But I could not write as well as I used to do, and looked for an on line diary.This failed simply because there was not enough space to write my notes on. People say that after a bad night, you simply cannot remember what the very bad dreams or nightmares were about. But these are so graphic that I can remember them in great detail the following day, so it's easy to jot down notes about what happened, especially if you lash out, and\u00a0 cause damage to furniture or your wife as I have done before. In the end I found an online blog, and started to write all about the illness as it happened. I guess that when your brain goes like mine did, you don't always see the obvious, and I did not really understand everything that was on the Web page.\u00a0 I would sit and write notes on this blog, never really taking on board anything else.It was only about a year later that I noticed a section heading labeled \"Audience\". At first I ignored it, then after a while I went back and pressed the button, to find that my personal blog was being read around the world.This gave me a big shock, and I decided to try to delete it all. However my wife stepped in and told me to leave it.It was then that we noticed another Heading for comments.I thought it odd to have a section called that, because I did not see the need for it.However after pressing it, we saw pages and pages of comments from people all over the world.Many of these were thanking me for writing my problems down, because it helped them to understand what was going on in their lives.I have since learnt that this is now read in 114 countries, by nearly 200-000 people, and is used in various Universities around the world for a teaching tool People always write to ask for permission to use sections, and that is fine, because it could help others So this was my first taste of blogging, and even today, I find things that I had not noticed before.I have gone from an Electrical Engineer where every little detail was important, to the position where I just don't see what is in front of me at times. It's weird, but also distressing as times, wondering where it's all going to end up But this has kept me going, and that's important. I am now looking forward to getting out with my camera, and then writing about it again However these days there are many blogs on all sorts of topics, so if you can use the internet is worth looking around Many of these blogs like Google Blogger, or Word Press are free to use, and it's a good way to pass information on as I do.Other places to get support are the various sections on Facebook or on Twitter. That was one way I cope with changes to my brain, although there are many other ways, to remain active.But what I am trying to say is this. After a diagnosis, life can be difficult and distressing at times, especially after a diagnosis like dementia. But we have to remember other family members, who may well have\u00a0 be struggling to cope at the same time, yet they did not show it.When it hit me, I really did not understand what was going on, I honestly thought that I was going mad, because nothing made any sense at all. It was difficult and hard to understand why,\u00a0 I just could\u00a0 not do my job anymore, and could not remember how to do electrical work. It was as if my memory had been partly wiped. To this day, things are no different, even putting a 13amp plug on can be stressful, yet I rewired a college Chapel?But things like my family, our dog Ben, and photography on good days which\u00a0 kept me going early onThese days it's my\u00a0 grandchildren and family who are there for me.\u00a0 It takes me longer to to plan and work things out these days, the same things that would have taken a few moments can now take hours or days. Along with that,\u00a0 as I said before I don't see the obvious anymoreI get very agitated when I write things out,\u00a0 and then repeat a complete sentence without realising I admit that there are days when even basic settings on my camera can be a nightmare to work out, but that's life with a memory doing its own thing, yet it's about the only hobby that I can still do,\u00a0 which is not dangerous. My woodturning became too dangerous and everything was sold off to stop me using it.My woodcarving is going the same way,\u00a0 as I am losing my coordination at times. So it means that all of my tools for carving will have to be sold off, before I do myself damage, but I have accepted this and moved on Yes there are times when I could have thrown the towel in, when things simply did not work as they used to do, but I have to accept this life now and move on while I can still do it.I admit that I have been depressed at times, but managed to get myself out of it, and do something, but that's common in this illness.I always say that there are others in a worse state of illness than I am, so for my families sake I must keep going.Technology is wonderful if you can use it, however I am struggling more and more these days. So it's finding a good day to write things down",

        "content": "I have just read some of Wendy Gibson's comments about dementia Awareness,\u00a0 and still find it staggering that some major UK companies are not really dementia friendlyMany years ago we had Talk Talk broadband, and found it very stressful, to get hold of someone you could understand clearly. Usually you got passed around the world, and never understood half of the people you had to talk too.Many think that because you don't understand a strong foreign accent, that you are being racist or rude.I have a problem with most accents, but find many foreign accents difficult at best to understand, and that's on a good day.Eventually after the floods in 2012, we went to BT, thinking that things would pick up, but that was even worse.I found that we ended up taking to someone in the far east again. On many occasions my wife would talk because I was having a bad day, and could not think clearly.However the people on the other end of the phone were arrogant and rude, they thought all females were to thick to understand what they were talking about. Even I found this to be too bad, because the phone was on speaker phone, so I heard what was being said.One day I took the phone off my wife and said that as a retired engineer I found there service to be a disgrace,On another day they contacted us when my wife was out , and started to ask many questions which I simply did not understand. In the end, I said sorry I don't understand you because i have Dementia? The person on the other end of the phone, said that I was being disrespectful to those with the illness, and put the phone down So I rang back asking to speak to a manager, and they were just as bad.Looking back I am sure that BT is supposedly Dementia Friendly? However we have also had problems with engineers when things go wrong, so I am assuming that BT are dementia friendly in name only.I also struggle with their email service and complained one day. I am assuming it was all of the adverts slowing\u00a0 the website down. So\u00a0 I asked if we could have them stopped, because I simply want to write or read an email, not to watch a lot of adverts. I was told to reset the page, but I had not got a clue as to what he was talking about, and even explaining that I had dementia just did not sink in.These people think that we all know about these websites and how to change settings, they forget that many of us have major problems working things out. I personally think that every so called dementia friendly company,\u00a0 should make sure that most,\u00a0 if not all of their staff understand what the illness is, before telling everyone that they are dementia friendly.I honestly think that's it's time that companies realised that, just because they are dementia friendly they know it all.Dementia friendly means nothing to anyone, if your staff treat people who have dementia etc, with a lack of respect We don't want any special treatment, just respect and understanding, something that everyone else takes for granted. Is this too much to ask these days ",

        "content": "NHS to start prescribing Apps to patients with long term conditionsHaving read this I do feel that this could be a big step forward for those with long term illnesses, and may cut down appointments each yearIf this is picked up used for other illnesses it could be a huge step forward, for those with chest and Heart problems The future of healthcare could be in your pocket. Two new medical apps that help people monitor their health at home, reducing their need to visit a doctor, are set to be rolled out to as many as four UK National Health Service trusts over the next year.The apps, which are currently beingtrialledin four hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK, transmit patient data from a tablet or smartphonedirectly to clinicians.According toIlan Lieberman, a member of the Royal Society of Medicine\u2019scouncil on telemedicine and e-health, such apps will have a huge impact on the management of chronic diseases.One system, called GDm-health, helps manage the treatment of gestational diabetes \u2013 a condition that affects about 1 in 10pregnant women. The smartphone app lets women send each blood glucose reading they take at home to theirdiabetesclinician.\u201cNow when a diabetes midwife logs on between clinics, she will see all the patients who are most in need of attention,\u201d saysLionel Tarassenko, of the Oxford University Institute of Biomedical Engineering, who led the development of the technology. A two-year trial at the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust found that the system meant that patients didn\u2019t need to go in person to the clinic as often, reducing the number of patient visits by 25per cent.App-solutely fine\u201cWe\u2019ve got three trusts wanting to install this for their gestation diabetes management,\u201d Tarassenko says, but his research group is too small to support any more trials. To overcome this hurdle, Drayson Technologies, owned by entrepreneur andLabourpeerPaul Drayson, is setting up a team of developers and support staff based in Oxford, UK, tocommercialiseit. The team will manage the rollout of this technology \u2013 as well as two other apps \u2013 at up to four as-yet-unnamed NHS trusts within a year. Beyond that, Drayson says he plans to eventually offer these products to the entire NHS.\u201cThis technology enables patients to go home and then be able to safely monitor their condition and be well connected back to the hospital,\u201d Drayson says. Charles Lowe, managing director of the Digital Health and Care Alliance, says that these smartphone apps make it easier for patients to manage their conditions while carrying on with their daily routines.Another system being rolled out by Drayson Technologies, also developed by the Oxford UniversityInstituteof Biomedical Engineering, is for managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition that affects between 1 million and 1.5 million people in the UK. Patients with COPD use a finger probe to measure their heart rate and blood oxygen saturation every day and enter the results into an app. After three months of measurements, the app learns torecognisea patient\u2019s specific range of normal oxygen saturation levels, and issues an alert to clinicians when the measurement falls below that range. \u201cIt is very important that the analysis adapts to individuals,\u201d says Tarassenko. If the system is too sensitive, it will send too many alerts to clinicians, but if it\u2019s not sensitive enough, it might miss problems.In a 12-month clinical trial, the app reduced hospital admissions by 17 per cent and GP visits by 40per cent. \u201cPatients are much more confident about managing themselves and are getting into trouble far less often,\u201d Tarassenko says.A third product ready for rollout, called SEND, is an iPad app used by nurses to input details about patients\u2019 vital signs as they make their rounds of the wards. It automatically calculates an early warning score based on the vital signs, giving an indication if the patient is deteriorating.Critical journeyRury Holman, at the Oxford Biomedical ResearchCentre, thinks the NHS trials are the right way forward. Although smartphone app stores are already crammed full of medical apps designed to manage all kinds of conditions, he believes that if similar apps are going to be used in the UK healthcare system, it\u2019s vital they are developed in close collaboration with the NHS.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like the Wild West out there with lots of keen and very motivated people producing these apps,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat we need are consistent standards and an interface with electronic patient records, particularly with the NHS, so that information, with permission from the patients, can be put to use centrally.\u201dBut approaches like this can raise privacy concerns. Last year,New Scientistrevealed details of adata-sharing agreementbetween the NHS and Google\u2019s DeepMind that gave the company access to healthcare data on 1.6 million patients including details of drug overdoses and abortions. Since late 2015, the AI company has been developing a healthcare app, Streams, that monitors the health of people with acute kidney injury.According to Tarassenko, his diabetes and lung disease apps only have access to information relating specifically to those conditions. The measurements sent to clinicians via the app are fed into existing patient records, but that process takes place outside of the app, within the NHS\u2019s central patient record systems.Developing these apps has taken eight years, but Tarassenko says securing the appropriate ethical clearance and building up a clear evidence base for their use is a critical, journey. \u201cIt\u2019s been very important for us to have credibility with our clinical colleagues, and we will continue to do that because it\u2019s designed in the NHS, for the NHS.\u201d",

Years ago they would have been kept well away, but these days, they are leading the fight and are very supportive It could well be that adults from a certain age remember the days, when people with this illness were locked away in hospitals etcIn my case our grandchildren have been marvelous with me, although at times it can be a little over powering,My eldest granddaughter who is 13, has Asbergers is truly amazing to be with. She is very protective of me, and always seems concerned that I am alright.\u00a0 She has a mobile phone now, for her own security when she is at school or out with friends, and has taken to sending me texts, or phones up to see if I am alright. The other day we went to London because I had to go to a reception at the House of Commons with the Lewy\u00a0 Body Society. So she sent a text at night to see if I was alright.The following morning she sent a text to see I had got home alright,\u00a0 even though my wife had been with me all dayAt first she wanted to speak to me over Skype,\u00a0 but this is something that I struggle to cope with, even though she set it up on my tablet computer, but as we were out shopping I had a good excuseHowever when I did not answer because we were crossing the road, she then rang up for a chat. Although she has her own problems, people are are amazed how she looks after me.It seems that when she is about to have a melt down, she disappears to her own room, or somewhere else well away from me. Her sister who is younger is very similar, and if I make a mistake, she always says, don't worry grampy,\u00a0 you are allowed to make mistakes because you have \"OLD TIMERS.\"Both of these girls have phones, but as I have their photographs on my phone I know who is trying to text or phone me.This service is good because I don't always recognise voices these days, so having a photograph with the number is very helpful.",

Since it started the running of the charity was taken over by Jacqui Cannon, the CEO.Jacqui works tirelessly to give the charity a higher profile, in honour of her father who had the illness until he passed away This charity is supported by people like Prof\u00a0 Ian McKeith who is the\u00a0 Lewy Body Societies President, and who works\u00a0 tirelessly at Newcastle university,\u00a0 looking and researching Lewy\u00a0 Body Dementia Without this Gentleman's eagerness we would not have the answers we have today, and while we have no cure, I have no doubt that it will come sooner or later.Newcastle University is one of the top Dementia research places in the UK, if not in Europe,\u00a0 and like others I have every faith that sooner or later, they will find the answers to this jigsaw The event started with a presentation by our host for the afternoon,\u00a0 MP for Wigan, Conor McGinn, who is also an Ambassador with the charity.After that we had a short presentation by Ashley herself, and then Prof Ian McKeith spoke to us about his work and ambitions, where the illness us concerned It was a real honour for my wife and I to be there after two years of problems, with diagnosis and also recurring chest problems, all of which seem to be in the process of being resolved My diagnosis\u00a0 of Lewy Body Dementia, was reversed to Mild Cognitive Impairment, because I was not deteriorating as fast as normal expected. However it was said that I may well have a slower burning form of Lewy Body Dementia.As these medical problems seemed to get\u00a0 a lot worse over the last two years, I got to the stage where I backed away from all charity and dementia work.However today, we went to London and had a lovely time.

Years ago I remember a consultant telling patients to stop smoking before they were admitted into hospital for an operation. But I suppose these days, it's against people's civil liberties telling them to stop smokingI understand that some hospitals work\u00a0 with patients, so they can give up smoking before they go into hospital, but not everyone wants to give it upHowever it's not just cigarettes which can be hazardous these days. I do wonder about these people with the vapour E cigs. It took a long time for the government to admit that cigarette smoking was bad for the health, but they seem to have ignored the fact that even cigs are fairly new, and as such there is very little safety information on hand about them.Having read some of the information I do wonder if they are more deadly than cigarettes. But NHS England seems to want people to smoke them, and this seems to be going against the grain to me. I would have thought it better all round for the NHS to say that all smoking is bad for you, because no one knows exactly what health problems e cigs\u00a0 are going to cause in the future. Is that going to leave the door open for people to sue the NHS in the future.I tend to steer clear of anyone smoking these electronic cigarettes, because the vapour has an effect on my chest, and other people have said the same. I simply do not understand people who have serious chest problems, but still carry on smoking. No matter what happens,\u00a0 your treatment cannot work properly if you carry on smoking, so to me it's common sense to give it up all together.I think it's time that everyone was educated about the hazards of smoking, and then we may get somewhere.But I do feel that we must start with school children ",

One for general work, like estimates, health and safety, reports and electrical testing etc.The other computer controlled every boiler room and ventialtion systems in the college, and if there was a fault, I could sort it out without leaving my chair. These days I have lost a lot of this information, and I am just hanging onto using a tablet computer for basic things. But I think that it's all down to understand and processing the information, which is in front of me. I struggle at times listening to what is being said, and hope that I have understood it properly, before I answer .I was horrified when I started writing a blog, because I did not recognise certain obvious things, and even these days it's a struggle. I have noticed that when Google change things on the blog, I get confused and uncertain about what I need to do. But it's all down to a lack of basic information processing, and it's becoming harder by the day. It's also very frustrating after being an engineer for 28 yearsMy brain does not process information the way it used to do it, and there days it has become a nightmare at times. However these days we hear that everything should be done via a computer and the internet, and it's becoming alarming when I see so many things turning this way It's all well and good if you were brought up with this technology and understand it But many people simply don't understand technology, and many find it overpowering or intimidating I find things so much easier to cope with, when I am discussing something face to face with a real person, rather than relying on the computer, or listening to ore recorded messages on the telephone But it's not just transactions from a bank or local council, it's everywhere we look.After a diagnosis we are told about support lines, or support centres, where we can call and get support, but many people like myself, would prefer to be sat down, talking face to face with a person we can see.Websites are becoming so complex these days, and it takes me a while to find out the correct section, I need to look at. It seems that many websites also change things round on a regular basis, just like supermarkets, which is fine to a certain extent, but when you have problems processing information as I do, it all becomes a nightmare. While I can understand a website being changed to make it easier for customers to use I certainly don't think they are in anyway dementia friendly. I do think that a lot if websites would benefit, if the companies involved asked people for their views rather than assuming that all is fine They may well be fine for business people, but that's about it.However more and more railway stations are converting to automatic ticket machines, rather than having people in kiosks selling you the tickets, and this is becoming a step too far for me.Machines like computers don't understand that the person standing there has information processing problems, and some of these things cut you off, if you take too long. As well as that, people standing waiting to use the machines usually get agitated and annoyed because you are causing a hold up,Technology goes in other directions too these days, as many people expect us to have smart phones, so that we can get emails, and online tickets for trains etc. But we must remember that there are thousands of people in this country who are unable to use technology for one reason or another, so we must never leave them behind. Yes there are millions in the country who use a phone every moment of the day, and never go anywhere without one clamped to their ears, but other people don't understand or want to go there So please don't expect everyone to enjoy able to use technology, because it cannot ever work.

As we know social care is funded locally from things like council tax.But there is a major problem with this, and that is that the council tax raised in your area, is not used locally, but is sent to Whitehall where it is then spilt amongst other councils in the UK.Many councils are facing savage cuts in funding, while at the same time they are seeing their council taxes being used by other county councils, who in many cases are much better off. These councils cannot possibly carry on providing social care when they are faced with these savage cuts, and to be honest, many people have no idea where their council taxes are spent.While I understand some councils are very small, population wise, and possibly need extra money, our council tax from the North East subsidises places like Surrey which is very wealthy.This leaves me feeling very annoyed at this Tory Government, because they have made many savage cuts to the council subsides over the last 10 or so years, and this simply cannot go on. A few years ago the councils in the North East did not get their quota of Rock salt for the roads, because the government thought that it was more important to give it to the southern regions. This was disgusting because the North gets a lot more snow and ice than the southern regions, so the roads here Councils cannot go on having these savage cuts without loosing more services, which are already down to the minimum already It seems wrong to me that money raised in local council taxes should be sent off to other councils in times like this, especially wealthy councils in the London Boroughs.It's also very wrong for a government to throw money at projects like \"HS2\" and Cross rail, glorified train sets for certain areas, when the NHS and social care are in such a terrible state. It's also fairly obvious that this government does not like Labour run councils, but they do not consider the fact that many millions of people actually voted Tory in the first place, no matter which political party are ruling their council However social care like the NHS, is important to all, yet it's not being provided because of these these false cuts, especially when the government is wasting billions of pounds on unwanted schemes.

        "content": "Lewy body dementia may often be misdiagnosed as Alzheimer\u2019s disease: StudyBy:Dr. Victor Marchione|Brain Function| Saturday, November 19, 2016 - 05:30 AMMailLewy body dementia (LBD) may often be misdiagnosed asAlzheimer\u2019s disease, according to research findings.Howard I. Hurtig, chair at the department of neurology, Pennsylvania Hospital warned,\u201cWhile the symptoms of LBD may be similar to Alzheimer\u2019s andParkinson\u2019s disease, the treatment strategy is more challenging because fewer medications can be used safely. I cannot overemphasize the need to avoid medications that can worsen the symptoms of LBD. Every patient with this disease and their caregivers should be familiar with the list of acceptable and forbidden drugs.\u201dAccording to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, what\u2019s called Lewy body dementia has three distinguishing features that eventually become apparent:Fluctuating alertness and attention resemblingdelirium,visual hallucinations, and Parkinson\u2019s-like symptoms, like tremors, rigidity, and even balance problems.It\u2019s this mixture of symptoms \u2013 not to mention LBD\u2019s similarity to diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s \u2013 that makes it difficult to diagnosis. What\u2019s more, LBD patients can easily have a bad day whenever they are poorly responsive, not knowing what time it is or where they are. But then the next day, they are their normal self once more, able to discuss their favorite TV show and distant memories equally.As a result, it can be pretty disabling for LBD patients and upsetting for family members and caregivers alike.What is Lewy body dementia exactly?While looking at Parkinson\u2019s disease in the early 1900s, scientist Friederich H. Lewy discovered abnormal protein deposits that disrupt the brain\u2019s normal functioning. These Lewy body proteins are found in an area of the brain stem \u2013 basically, where they deplete the neurotransmitter dopamine, causing Parkinson\u2019s-like symptoms.In LBD, these abnormal proteins are spread throughout other areas of the brain. The brain chemical acetylcholine is then depleted, which adversely affects perception, thinking, and overall behavior. LBD exists on its own or in conjunction with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease.According to the Lewy Body Dementia Association, LBD is not a rare disease. It affects roughly 1.3 million Americans.LBD now refers to both Parkinson\u2019s disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. The earliest symptoms of these two diseases differ, but are the result of the same biological changes in the brain. Over a period of time, people with both diagnoses will develop similar cognitive, physical, sleep, and behavioral symptoms.Although the cause of LBD isn\u2019t exactly clear, several factors may increase the risk of developing the disease \u2013 such as being male and older than 60, as well as having a family member with LBD.On average, the disease has a duration of five to seven years. But it can still continue anywhere between two and 20 years, depending on a person\u2019s overall health, age, and severity of symptomsTreatment options for Lewy body dementiaThere\u2019s no cure for LBD, and treatment can be challenging because each person with LBD and other dementias experiences symptoms differently. Still, the individual symptoms of LBD can be treated by patients and caregivers, according to the Mayo Clinic.For one thing, Alzheimer\u2019s disease medications like rivastigmine (Exelon) help increase the levels of chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) thought to be important for memory, thought, and judgment in the brain. This can improve alertness and cognition, and may help reduce hallucinations and other behavioral problems. Possible side effects may include gastrointestinal upset, excessive salivation and tearing, and frequent urination.Sometimes, simply modifying a patient\u2019s environment helps. That\u2019s because reducing clutter and distracting noise can make it easier for someone with dementia to focus. It can also reduce the risk of hallucinations in people with LBD.We all know that exercise benefits everyone, including people with dementia. Exercising may slow the progression of impaired thinking in LBD patients. Crossword puzzles and other thinking activities may be beneficial, too.In order to help prevent nighttime restlessness and disorientation, patients and caregivers should try limiting caffeine during the day, eliminating daytime napping, and establishing a sound nighttime ritual.Alternatively, you can try medicine and techniques that help promote relaxation, too: Music therapy, which involves listening to soothing music; pet therapy, which involves visits from animals to promote improved moods and behaviors in people with dementia; aromatherapy, which uses fragrant plant oils; and finally, massage therapy.It\u2019s important to note that it may take more than a year or two for enough LBD symptoms to develop. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to pursue a formal diagnosis and treatment early on. It will make a difference to quality of life.",

I notice this when we travel down to London on the train, because the air in Kings Cross station is deadly, and this is highlighted by the alarm going off on my phone application telling me that the air is getting bad.Breezo meter app.However it's not just in London stations that we see and taste this foul air, it's all over the country these days. Although the Government knows just how bad polution is in this country, it seems as if it just does not care.There was a report done before the last general election, but the government said that it could not do anything until after the election.\u00a0 Now we are passed it and this report is still hidden away. I guess they will wait until the World Health Authority stands up and sues the UK Government, for being incompetent However it's not just the elderly that may be struggling with this toxic air, its our children and Grandchildren, who will struggle with chest problems in years to come. It is said that pollution is monitored in many towns and city's these days, but I wonder what happens with the results, are they simply shredded or deleted when it proves far too toxic to produce..It seems that this Government has lost its way and no longer cares about the citizens in the UK. I guess that this is the worst side of a capitalist Government, who think only if themselves.When we look around these days, most of the rail infrastructure and rolling stock is owned by Foreign Train companies, or foreign leasing companies, who will charge extra for clearer rolling stock etc.Many of the larger road fleet operators may be looking after their vehicles better than smaller operators, but there are still thousands of dirty polluting vehicles on the UK roads, and it makes me wonder how they pass an MOT test, in the first place Chest problems are costing the NHS a lot of money, yet the Government cannot see this, and I now wonder if it ever will, or will it carry on burying it's head in the sand. It worry me that this Government is passing everything over to local authorities these days, and I feel that in many cases this is wrong,\u00a0 because we need the whole country to be on a level playing field so everything is standard where ever we go. It's no good having strict pollution guidelines in one town or city and not anywhere else.I think that this shows that this Government is out of control now, like a rudderless ship. After all of these years of stable Government it fills me with fear for the next 5 years. However we must all work together for our children and Grandchildren, because it's their health at risk with this pollution now, an no regulations like Health and safety etc are going to make any difference ",

        "content": "We have a brilliant NHS and police, fire services etc, but along with this we have another service, which is voluntary, and hardly gets a mention at times. This is our carers,\u00a0 who never get mentioned largley because the media and the\u00a0 Government don't really care, until it comes to award ceremonies, then they turn\u00a0 up and praise those involved. But that's in front of television cameras etc. We hear about these carers who do wonderful jobs around the world, but many of these have their own individual health problems, which are largely ignored These people from young children, to the elderly,\u00a0 do a brilliant job, mostly without any support what so ever from the social services\u00a0 or the Governments These people save Governments millions of pounds each year, and hardly get as much as a thank you let alone payments for their role. Once a carer is retired, they lose their benefits altogether, even though they are still doing the same caring role, and that to me is disgusting Many years ago my wife had a serious\u00a0 road accident, after which she had to fight for her life, and then endured over three years of having umteen operations in hospital, where they did their best to save her life,\u00a0 and then rebuilt\u00a0 her leg and foot, which were close to being severed.There were times when I thought we had lost her, and that was hard, because I got so little sleep, due to worrying about what was to come. During that time, I looked after the children, while keeping my job going, and fitted in hospital visits, which in many cases were after patient visiting hours, but that hospital cared, and supported us in any way they could. I admit that my wife wasn't with it most of the time, due to all of the pain killers etc, but I needed to go, as did the children. But during that time,\u00a0 the Sister and nursing staff looked after us all especially the children, and over time we all became firm friends.During this time our 8 year-old daughter and 6 year old son,\u00a0 kept me going, because I was permanently shattered, and without them\u00a0 I would have been in a\u00a0 messNow the roles have reversed and Janice is my carer, and without her I would be lost.But she hardly ever complains about her leg, which still causes a lot of\u00a0 problems, she just accepts it.One of my granddaughters has Asbergers, and life can be difficult for those around her.But around me she is very caring, and walks away when she is going to have a melt down. Other times she is one of the most protective and caring young girls I could ever meet She understands when I am struggling, although she can be a little over powering at times,\u00a0 her heart is in the right place. My daughter is her carer, and there are times when I feel for her, because seeing these meltdowns and hearing what goes on can be frightening,\u00a0 if you are not expecting it.But it's amazing how this young girl puts others first, even though she has her own problems The other day their neighbour got flooded when a water main burst outside the house at\u00a0 5am. Yet this 11 year old young girl asked her mum,\u00a0 if she could make the firemen a cup of tea. This brought me to tears,\u00a0 because it proves she trys to think of others at times.Yes she can cause problems when she is stressed,\u00a0 hungry or tired, but otherwise she is lovely to be with, So these days I get really annoyed by the Governments attitude towards carers, because they seem to have little or no respect for them, even though they are doing a brilliant job on their own What is more,\u00a0 this Government should be doing more to support these carers\u00a0 rather than cutting services to the bare bone, while wasting money on unneeded projects.However it's not just this Government, the last Labour Government under Mr Blair was exactly the same, uncaring PLEASE, remember Carers come in all ages, and in many cases have their own individual health\u00a0 problems, \"BUT THEY NEVER STOP CARING\"Caring is a\u00a0\u00a0 24 hour\u00a0 role, 7 days a week,\u00a0 and it takes its tole on our carers, so please think about them, and respect them ",

It all looked like some war zone I remember turning the scrambled eggs over in the glass dish, and it all stayed firmly in the dish, and did not move. I thought it was there to stay, but I managed to get it out.After years of doing this on my own, I was a little shocked at how things turned out. I used to, love cooking, but realise that it's a no go area these days. But I guess it's because I cannot plan things out, and time them as I used to Still life goes on, and the boss is back home again, so the food will not look like a war zone anymore.

Nurses are told to speak quietly and touch the person going through these, in the hope of bringing them out of this But as I pointed out to graduate nurses while giving a presentation last year, this can be highly dangerous to anyone trying to help.As my\u00a0 wife has found out at times, that is hazardous, because she\u00a0 can become part of the nightmare, and then get hurt in the process. My wife tried this one night, and ended up with a nasty black eye and bruises after one nightly horror show, and that was upsetting for me, as well as for her.This proved that it can be hazardous, if you get too close to someone going through one of these nightly horror shows.I understand that\u00a0 I lash out and kick out, once these things start. There seems to be no reason for these, as many of them bare no links to reality, and that makes life hard to work out. A few years ago the medication was stepped up In\u00a0 the hope of stopping this, but it was so bad one night that I tried to climb out of a third floor\u00a0 hotel window, in the hope of getting away from the nightmare. Luckily for me the windows only opened so far,\u00a0 so I never got out A friend of mine who lived with the same illness, thought his dreams bore a resemblance to pictures of Terry Pratchets books, and I agreed with some of this. After a nightmare, if I am lucky enough to wake up on my own, I usually get up, and either sit in the bathroom, or go downstairs for a while, if I am not feeling wobbly. However sometimes,\u00a0 these things start off all over again from where they had stopped, and that is terrifying I think part of the problem is that when I\u00a0 wake up, I cannot tell the difference between the nightmare or reality, and it seems to take a while to settle down.A few years ago after a flood damaged our home we were moved into a small flat, and one night I had the worst night I had ever had. I was convinced that I had woken up from a nightmare and had gone into the sitting room, had a cup of tea, and had then gone to the toilet. This happened three times, then I eventually woke up and realised that it was all part of the nightmare. My wife said I woke up in a total\u00a0 panic Although there was no damage at all, this\u00a0 shook me rigid because I was convinced that I had been up three times, and had gone to the toilet. Having totally demolished two bedside lights and other things, there is now nothing important next to my side of the bed. After seeing the damage after a bad night, it brings you down to earth a little But I could describe everything in great detail, when I wake up,\u00a0 which is not nice. I confess that I am absolutely terrified of ever being sent into a hospital, because I have no control over what happens during these nights, and the last thing I want is to be charged with assaulting a nurse or anyone else, while I am going through a night like this. Although things are not as bad as they used to be, it's still difficult to understand. I often wake up in a morning feeling very tired and sometimes ache, I guess because of the lashing out. While it's difficult for me it must be worse for my wife, because it means that she must keep her distance while trying to wake me up When this all started, I thought that I was going mad,\u00a0 but I understand that it's all part of the Lewy Body Dementia. Perhaps it also accounts for my deep sleeping during the day. ",

I also bought a Sigma lens which I possibly should\u00a0 have steered well clear of, instead of buying a canon lens Without hesitating he said, please don't worry sir, I will check things over and explain what's wrong. I knew that the lens worked fine in manual, but the motor was not working properly in automatic settings. As the lens is now out of warranty, I don't want to get caught out paying more for the repair, than the lens is worth.\u00a0 This happened to me once before, so, I am careful never to get involved like this again. I have had a lot of use out of this lens since I bought it 4 years ago, but I guess that with my balance issuses,\u00a0 and changing lenses when needed, is not too good when your brain does its own thing at times To me this was an ideal multi purpose\u00a0 lens,\u00a0 so I only used this, rather than carrying a few lenses and changing it over regularly\u00a0 for a different lens. This technician\u00a0 had a kind attitude, rather than the usual stroppy attitude that we get used to in shops these days. He was interested in my problems and worked on the lens for over 15 mins, before\u00a0\u00a0 telling me that it would need to be sent away for repairs. As it was a motor problem in autofucus, he was unsure as to how much the repair would cost, so I decided to think about it and replace the lens later if I needed to. However I will carry on using this in my good days, and replace it later in when I can no longer use manual settings I said that I would think about whether to have it repaired, and left the shop after thanking him for his kindness.

I found it hard when the children would treat me with kid gloves at times,but it was Claire's way of protecting me at times.Last Monday we travelled down to London where we stayed over in a hotel for a night, before going to a meeting about Dementia. After this we headed off to our daughters in Farnborough in Hampshire where we stayed till Saturday.During the week we walked to school with one Grandchild or the other as both girls are in different schools, but it was so nice when they hang on to your hand and talk to you and confess that at times it was very hard to take as I was starting to get emotional.On the Thursday Claire had to take one daughter straight into town from school, to get her feet measured, and as things were going to be tight, and my wife was needed to keep an eye on the grandson who is the youngest and gets into everything. So she asked if I would be alright going up to the school to pick up the youngest from the primary school which is about 1 1/2 miles away. I have walked this route on may occasions, and enjoy the walk, as it is relaxing, so I agreed to do it. Having got to the school, I waited as everyone came out, and the teacher looked at me and asked who I was waiting for, and I explained. I had seen my grand daughter wandering round the classroom, but she was in her own little world, and perhaps because she had not seen her mum she did not come out.She asked where everyone was and I explained and said that we were walking home. On the way I asked what she had been doing at school and whether she had enjoyed herself. She was quiet at first, but then started talking about spellings, and how she sometimes gets things wrong or spelt the wrong way, as some words sound differently to the way they are spelt. I said that I loved spelling when I was at school, but these days I can not always remember how words are spelt( and without spell check I would not be doing this, although sometimes spell check can not fathom out the words I am trying to spell) so I am stuck.She looked up at me and said. But Grampy you have an excuse as you have old timers?I confess that I was taken back by this and felt very tearful as this little girl of five had remembered this, and I felt very humbled that she was being so thoughtful in what she said, and for someone 5 year old that takes some imagination.We had a long talk going home, and after she had changed out of her school uniform, she came back downstairs and started talking again, sounding so old for her age. As Claire has said on many occasions she is 5 year old, yet there are times she sounds more like 35. I had trouble trying to explain this to my wife and Claire, because I was still close to tears, the effect had been something I had never expected, as it was so spontaneous.So it proves that children can understand more about this illness that we accept, and possible think more about it than adults. 1 commentThese children always make excuses for me when I make a mistake, and every time, it the same these days. But Grampy you have an excuse, you have OLD TIMERS.It always makes me think, but its so nice that they understand, that I am struggling at times to get my brain into gear",

I have heard that people with lung problems such as Chronic Obstructive\u00a0 Pulmonary Disease and Bronchiectasis can go on to get Mild Cognitive Impairment, so could this mean that other pollutants cause serious memory problems Many people worked and lived in areas where pollution was high, but I guess you got to the stage where you just got on\u00a0 with it. In my job as an engineer I got into many hazardous areas, and worked in many areas that have now been reclassified as hazardous to health. When we lived in Oxford, we lived near to one of the busiest roads leading into the city, and there were times we could taste the fumes. We also had an allotment garden near to the road,\u00a0 so I guess the fumes were going into the vegetables which were being grown there,. So\u00a0 I think that it was a double whammy as far as toxic fumes goNot far away, we had the city railway station, where diesel fumes were being pumped out every day. But as with many other places, you just got on with lifeI know that this did not help my chest problems, but we had to live somewhere, and this road had been fairly quiet until the last few years when we lived there This Oxford basin as it was known,\u00a0 always had a mist or fog hanging over it to the west of the city where we lived, but whether this caused by the mist rising from the river etc, or whether it was a combination of mist and pollution we will never know I guess this because the city council tried to ignore it, as it was bad for business,\u00a0 and would cost too much to clean up.  While this may have been the start of my memory problems especially after being in hospital with pnumonia , I never connected memory problems with anything else in life. However it's still early days as far as this research is concerned, and it may be many years before we get the answers to this problem, is we ever do.",

But it appears there are so many NHS quangos these days no one really knows what they do anymore, apart from wasting public money I heard the other day that there are around 15 of these quangos, hiding within the NHS, and I was shocked. When we hear about the NHS, we automatically think about hospitals or doctors surgeries, but the money goes to many other places.Governments keep telling us the hospitals are getting more money each year, but I guess that it's not keeping up with inflation or the management salaries, which go up every year. The other day I was at one hospital waiting for an echocardiogram, and watched two men pushing a wheely bin around the ward. Having worked for the NHS in the 1960s I was staggered that it took two men to push this thing around, when one elderly person could do it on their own I guess that as these hospitals are built and run by private companies they can do exactly what they want, and we have to pay for it. However to me it's time that the department of health stepped in and charged all of those who keep getting drunk and need hospital treatment, including an ambulance I cannot see why these people get away scotch free, when their treatment takes up so much time, and costs quite a lot of money. This is money we have to pay for those idiots who are so drunk that they need hospital treatment. My wife had a serious road accident in the 1980s, and I remember the shock of receiving a bill from the NHS for the ambulance, while she was in hospital undergoing series of major operations.So perhaps the whole system needs a good shakeup in the next year. While all if he is goes on, it's the Doctors,\u00a0 Nurses and patients who suffer and are\u00a0 at risk, while the pen pushers and management, fill their pockets and go home at 5 pm every night ",

Having done this for three years after my wife had a serious road accident, and I had my job to keep going,\u00a0 while looking after two children, I found this very tiring.It was only later when a barrister asked me how much my wife was worth, after the accident,\u00a0 that I realised that I really did not have a clue as to how much work she got through in a day while I was out. I had thought him to be callous by asking this in the first place, but afterwards I understood his reason, because our families are not replaceable no matter how much compensation you get I doubt if many men would have a clue as to what work their wives did while they were working.During this time I heard many stories of marriages breaking up, because the wife and mother of the household, had like my wife, had a serious accident and was going to need umpteen operations in hospitalAs there was no stable person running the home, the husband walked away from his wife and their marriage This always seemed to me to feel a very cruel and thoughtless thing to do. This is partly because marriage in many mens eyes is nothing more than,\u00a0 \"ME\" working and you looking after the house and Me?\u00a0 It's not a shared role that many take for granted or have these days But I guess that I am one of the odd ones, who still consider marriage to be shared between both parties But I have a sad recollection of many men telling me as an apprentice, \"they\" the men made the money, while their wives looked after the house and provided a hot meal when they got home at night etc. This always sounded sexist, as most of these men really did not have a clue. However if the roles were reversed and the men were forced to stay at home doing homework, while their wives went to work, I think many men would complain about being over worked All in all, I still consider the ladies to be\u00a0 the stronger sex,\u00a0 and I think a lot of people would agree with this ",

It seems that in many places the community spirit has disappeared completely This country is now a tax haven for many wealthy foreigners, who know how to get away without paying their taxes etc, yet they use our health service free of charge. This includes some politicians in the UK, who don't pay their right amount of tax,\u00a0 if they pay any here at all, yet they are still fiddling expenses, even though they know it's illegal.Yet while this is going\u00a0 on, millions of people in the UK are becoming poorer, and many are left on the streets at night, because there is no where else for them to go, and that includes many ex services peopleThe same people who fought for this country,\u00a0 are discarded like rubbish by\u00a0 this uncaring Government.

The other day we saw a programme on television where a gentleman had fallen out hard times through no fault of his own, and was evicted. His dog who he had looked after for years, was taken to battersea dogs home, because he could not allow the animal to live a rough life\u00a0 with him in a tent.

Why should supporters pay the high cost when many players don't pay their full portion of tax in the UK, it's so wrong and should be stopped, especially as British workers are being hammered with tax, yet the wealthy get away with out paying very much.This all seems so wrong to me.To add even more insult to this, when you see a game on television there is always an NHS ambulance standing by in case of an accident on the pitch.Surely this all needs to change to make things more even in this country.Far too many other foreign workers who came here to work and pay tax here have been victimised by Brexit while football players, etc get away scot free.",

        "content": "I fear we are seeing the end of social care in the UK, and the Government is not helping the situation.However many councils are struggling to cope with savage cuts to their budgets, and social care is one of the worst hit sections being cut, all of which has a knock in effect. Most of the local council care homes in County Durham, have been closed and pulled down, simply because they were out of date. While I can understand this, i do feel that councils have neglected the care sector for more high profile projects, completely forgetting about those who have worked hard all of their lives.These days it's possible to build a care home which could if needed, be upgraded to suite without too much trouble, but no one wants to know about it. Social care has been struggling for years now, even under the last Labour Government, and these cuts are making things much worse, while the government sits and throws money around on useless projects like HS2.When I think of the cost of the two new Royal Navy aircraft carriers which will not be in use until at least 2020, and the billions being spent on HS2, it's staggering, because we could have ensured that of care homes and hospitals were running properly and efficiently. I believe a lot if this could have been resolved, if this country had a viable opposition party, who were respected, but it's been a long time since this happened Along with this hospitals are struggling to cope with the vast numbers of elderly who are in hospitals simply because they have no where to go. These people should either be at home, or in care homes, but these days even care homes are struggling to cope. Many of these people are unable to go home because they possibly live on their own, or their local social, services cannot cope Like it or not social care is a right these days, because many of us have worked all of our lives and have paid social security, yet this seems to have been forgotten about by those in power nationally and locally.This could also be down to the fact that many politicians these days are wealthy or are very well off, and don't consider anyone else. To me personally, if your local councils cannot provide social care, it should be taken over by the Government and NHS. However it's now time to sort out the political mess in this country, and resolve issuses like the security services, armed forces, health and education by using cross party committees, and stop these unnecessary and needless changes we have everytime a new Government gets elected We should have ministers who have been trained in certain areas like health, running projects instead of some local idiot with no health service knowledge running the NHS etc.This is not a business, but people's lives at risk, and while the NHS is in a mess it needs sorting out properly by those who really do understand what's needed.I fear too much of this NHS mess goes back to the days when a hospital board was disbanded and replaced with a chief executive.At least the board was made up of health service professionals like Doctors, Matrons, Engineers etc, and all stores were bought centrally from the NHS stores, so every hospital was the same. These people were also accountable, and they got the sack if they underperformed, unlike today where they get a golden handshake However I do feel that it's perhaps time for the social care to be taken over by the government, as they have been taking the money for it for many years, while blaming others Local councils should also shoulder some of the blame rather than blaming others all of the time because they have neglected to do their job properly, by not looking after the elderly ",

I wondered if there was something wrong then, and it looks as if we were right, because that must have been the start of the dementia She was a formidable lady, who never took prisoners, but would stand by you if you got into a sticky situationWhen my wife had a serious road accident, she had a direct line to the hospital, so that she knew what was happening. This carried on for nearly three years until my wife's treatment finished Through her the\u00a0 College also hired a solicitor, to look into the road accident,\u00a0 and then hired a barrister to look after us She also put me on flexible hours so that I could look after the children, and also go into the hospital as and when needed. No other boss would have done that for us, but I could be wrong She also worked hard to hang onto staff she really wanted to keep on board Being on call 24 hours a day, it was not unheard of to see her waiting to meet me\u00a0 in the College, in the middle of the night, when things went wrongOnce she was happy that you had everything in hand, she would disappear back to her flat and leave you to get on with the jobI guess she kept her finger on the pulse, and ran a tight ship.If I was not satisfied with something I had done in the College, I was told off for having very high standards. But at the same time she admired those who were not always satisfied with what they had completed, because they were in her eyes perfectionists.It was not unheard of, to be invited into her large office to discuss a project or a problem.But I always felt out of my depth sitting there in her armchairs. I was always sure that she could read people's minds, because she always seemed to know what\u00a0 was going on before I did, and that was weird. Because I was on call 24 hours a day, and had young children, she gave me her pager, so that I could get on\u00a0 with life at weekends, and not get tied down to the telephone all of the time.This was a few years before mobile phones really came out, so this meant that we could go down to our allotment garden etc, and relax while being on call. While I know that she was a lot older than we were, we admired the way she ran things. However it seems so sad that someone who was so formidable and knowledgable has been reduced to this. She did so much for the family that she will always be remembered and respected ",

I say that because the tradesmen could not even use hand tools, something which shocked me.It was obvious from the start that because I was going to push to get the work done, that they were going to drag it out, and take as long as they wanted.It took us a long time to get the house dried out properly, and then the builders did not come back for around 6 weeks, by which stage the house was becoming damp all over again.After blasting they clerk if works, about the standard of work,\u00a0 I was told that I expected too much, and my standards were far too high. That's something I was shocked to hear.If you are trained to do a good job, you expect the same from others Thankfully I don't remember a lot about this period, but my wife said the other day that I told the clerk of works, that I would not hire these builders to build a dog kennelWhile the house was drying out, we had both set too, to clear the silt and rubbish out from under the floor joists, after which they tried to have us banned from entering the house again. The trouble was that the floor was covered with 50mm of this wet silt, and until it was removed the concrete was not going to dry out. The insurance companies always say that they will reinstate the house to its former condition, but I think that was a statement that was never going to be true.Even though we moved back in again in the January 6 months after the flood, we were in for a rough ride, when the plaster and paint started to fall off and crack. They had used adhesive to stick the skirting boards onto the walls,\u00a0 which may be fine when the walls are dry, but when they are damp, the adhesive fails to work, and the skirting boards simply fell off. After several arguments I told the builders to\u00a0 get out, and said that I would put things right myself So these days when I see people complaining on television, about the state of their homes after flooding, and the treatment they have received from builders etc, I can honestly say that I agree with them all if the way. It really is time that insurance companies started to treat people with respect and use quality builders to do this work.It's time that they respected other people's homes and possessions. ",

One thing I find amazing these days is that those people with chronic chest problems, are all told to drink lots of fluids. But when we are weighed at the doctors etc, we are then told that we are Overweight? I always get weighed in the morning straight after my shower, so I know what weight I am before getting dressed and having breakfast However, as I was told by a nurse recently, that simply does not matter, it's the weight you are when you are at the hospital, not first thing in the morning.?So how can this work in reality, if you have been in bed all night, you are not nessessariy getting up to have a drink. If like me and many others like us, you get hot during the night through chest problems, you may sweat any moisture out of the body, and then the rest is drained off when you go to the toilet first thing on a morning. That to me gives me the correct weight, not fully dressed fed and watered much later. Yet thearticle below in the Independent Newspaper seems to raise interesting issues with drinking water, which arenot discussed by the medical profession Drinking too much water can be deadly, doctors warnReport comes after 59-year-old woman admitted to hospital with 'water intoxication'Lucy Pasha-RobinsonFriday 2 December 2016Indy Lifestyle OnlineDoctors are questioning whether there is a safe amount of water to drinkRex FeaturesHealthcare professionals have warned of the dangers of telling people to \u201cdrink plenty of fluids\u201d after a woman was admitted to hospital with water intoxication.After developing symptoms of aurinary tract infection, the 59-year-old increased her water intake, drinking more than half a pint every 30 minutes, which she hoped would \u201cflush out her system.\u201dHowever, she quickly fell seriously ill and was admitted toKing\u2019s College hospitalwith dangerously low levels of salt in her blood, a potentially fatal condition if left untreated.Now, doctors are questioning whether there is a \"safe\" amount of water to drink, and called for greater evidence to know how much water is too much.In theBritish Medical Journal case report, doctors Laura Christine Lee and Maryann Noronha asked: \u201cWe frequently advise our patients to \u2018drink plenty of fluids\u2019 and \u2018keep well hydrated\u2019 when they are unwell. But, what do we mean by that? Are there potential risks of this apparently harmless advice?\u201dThe report describes how their patient\u2019s condition continued to worsen after she was admitted to hospital.\u201cDuring her visit to the emergency department, she became progressively shaky and muddled. She vomited several times, was tremulous and exhibited significant speech difficulties,\u201d they wrote.\u201cThroughout the day she had consumed severallitresof water based on medical advice she recalled from previous similar episodes.\u201dWater intoxication is a well-documented symptom of some endurance sports and the use of certain drugs, including MDMA, which can cause excessive thirst.However, the condition can be deadly with symptoms including nausea, vomiting and headaches and in serious cases, brain swelling, confusion, seizures, coma and death.Patients with abnormally low salt levels, as a result of hyponatremia or water intoxication, have a death rate of almost 30per cent.\u201cI have patchy recollections of being asked questions I understood but seemed unable to articulate answers for and found this distressing. I remember seeing my partner looking grave and forlorn, which was more frightening than what was happening as I did not know or understand what was happening,\u201d the patient, writing of her own experience in the same journal, said.\u201cI remember seeing my hand in front of me shaking rather violently and I wondered why I could not stop it, thenrealisedthat my whole body was shaking.\u201dDr Imran Rafi, chairman of clinical innovation and research at theRoyal College of GPs, said it was important to stay hydrated but there was no steadfast recommendation as to how much water people should drink.Five a day' advice should be reconsidered, GPs' chief says\u201c'Drinking enough water is important in keeping healthy, both physically and mentally, and patients should keep their fluids up when unwell, particularly in conditions that can cause dehydration,\u201d he said.\u201cWe would encourage patients to drink more if they have symptoms of dehydration, such as feeling thirsty \u2013 including in hot weather or when exercising \u2013 or passing dark-colouredurine.\u201cThere is no steadfast recommendation as to how much water people should drink in order to stay healthy, but the key thing is to keep hydrated \u2013 and passing clear urine is a good indication of this.\u201cThis case report highlights that excessive water intake can have important consequences for patients, and this is something that healthcare professionals, and patients, should be mindful of.\u201dPublic Health Englandrecommend drinking between six and eight glasses of fluid a day, while currentNHS Englandguidelines suggest drinking \u201cplenty of water\u201d.The Independenthad contacted NHS England for comment.",

I guess I\u00a0 was what was called conservative in everything I ate.These days however I can eat curries all day given the chance, and what is more, the hotter and spicier the better.

        "content": "Its been in the press quite a lot recently about keeping fit, when you have a brain problem like dementia, but this is not as easy as it sounds, because there are not enough trained staff in the country to cope with these illnessesI have often wondered how you are supposed to keep fit, when you have dementia, memory, or any other neurological illnesses, because your brain does not work as fast as other people brains, therefore your reactions are much slower.I was once told by one doctor at home that I was overweight, and should do something about it.So after a few weeks of wondering what to do, I was referred to the local gym.However this was to be short lived, as the instructors knew very little about their roles, let alone dementia and neurological problems.I went for my induction, and was told to be careful, in following all of the given advice, but had this young lady really been listening when my wife explained that I had a form of dementia, obviously not.The next day I turned up, and was going to speak to the instructors, who were there that day, but guess what, there was no one available.So I carefully checked the scribbled notes I had written, and got started.Eventually I came to the tread mill, and looked at it carefully. The problem being that people with dementia or neurological illnesses,don't always see the obvious.I pressed the button on the machine, and had to run extremely fast, but eventually fell off the back of the machine. I stopped the machine, got back on and the same thing happened again. Suddenly from nowhere an instructor appeared and gave me a rocket for mucking around. I tried to explain my problem but she simply walked away and ignored my comments.I felt to shocked at this that I walked out and never went back, although I did complain to the local council who owned the gym, but never got a reply.My answer to this was and is that Durham County Council was never, and will never be Dementia a Friendly when they have this attitude.So how can anyone use these facilities when they have dementia and the staff, really do not care?Previously to this I used to swim, but now my coordination, has gone completely, because when I am swimming and move my arms, and now my mouth opens at the wrong time, so hey presto, I swallow more water than enough.In the end I started walking, because in enjoy it and can do this at my own speed.I remember when I used to cycle and through my son we did the Coast to Coast cycle ride of around 140 miles, this was extremely hard work, but these days as I have hip and knee, problems along with Bronchiectasis, so I would never get onto a bike, let alone cycle any distance on it.When doctors refer you to these places, I do wonder if they have any real idea what will happen.Looking back some of this is funny to me now, but it certainly was not at the time.But I do think that the media should think carefully before writing articles about people with these illnesses and keeping fitRecently they have been saying that weight lifting helps the memory, I dread to think how that works with a brain like mine these days.

In many cases the abusers were largely well known people, and many of these were held in high respect by all in the community, and in some cases they were people who were idolised by parents etc, so it just would not happen But no matter which way you may look at it, you never really get over what you were put through as a child or a minor Many of us had strict parents, who held you to the letter of the law, and using a belt etc was common place at home if you misbehaved If you got told off by anyone either at school or by a policemen, you then got into trouble at home when your parents found out, even if you were innocent But out side the house you were largely on your own, and had to learn to grow up fast without backup or support of family or friends In many cases those who were abused, were warned, or threatened never to speak to their families about what was happening otherwise someone would get hurt. I have heard of many who grew up,\u00a0 living with horrors of the abuse from childhood days, or as minors, and simply got to the stage where they could not take it anymore,\u00a0 and ended their lives\u00a0 Looking at this abuse, just how do you explain it to someone close to you.Many have said that they feel dirty or violated, and have trouble mixing with other people after this, so it becomes hard if not very difficult to explain to anyone.I would imagine many parents would be heart broken, if they really realised what their children had been through, and if its someone high profile it must be even worse.I always said that, if anyone touched one of my children, I would have probably ended up in court or prison, because I would not have accepted it.\u00a0 Yes i know that it's wrong to think like that, but in this day and age, it's very hard to accept childhood abuse.It's made much worse these days because once the media latch onto it, they never ever let go, and this again brings back the horrors of what has happened many years ago.Even the BBC who sat back and did nothing about Jimmy Saville when he was working for them, seem to relish child abuse and this makes many left feeling sick.If the BBC had sorted their Saville mess out years ago,\u00a0 and had gone to the police, many children abuse\u00a0 cases would never have happened Every time I hear about child abuse on the news, I\u00a0 feel sick and heart broken for all who were put through this, and we're sadly hung out to dry by officials, the very people who could have stopped this.

I personally do not think anyone would be so stupid as to try to say they had an illness like dementia if they did not have it We then asked for a second opinion at a different hospital, and after a while we got an appointment After seeing a different consultant it was stated that it could have been a slow burning form of lewy Body Dementia, and things were getting worse slower than normal But we were told to use the term of \"Mild Cognitive Impairment\" until things got sorted out properlyAs it was pointed out, this meant that I did not have to disclose it for travel insurance, because it was not as bad as dementiaAs we all know those with any illness like dementia are hit hard when it comes to travel insurance so this was good to hear While I can accept that, I still find it hard to accept that two consultants got a diagnosis wrong.However I am still living with the same symptoms and problems as I had in the first place, so nothing has changed These days I am struggling to use my camera properly which is upsetting, but I am gradually accepting that my diagnosis has changed and life must go on However as many people have said, there is nothing mild about Mild Cognitive Impairment, because it can be very distressing when you forget how to do the things you have done for years But this has all taken a back seat at present as my recurring chest infections got to the stage where I was sent to see a chest consultant, after being ill quite a lot What I was told was COPD after years of chest problems since early childhood is now Bronchiectasis.",

My problem is\u00a0 that I have tried to carry on doing DIY jobs at home, only to end up soaking wet with sweat, and totally drained after only a few minutes, and that is very hard to accept.After working as an engineer, on call 24 hours a days, this is difficult to understand let alone move on fromGoing up stairs is becoming harder by the day, but it's a way of exercising, so I keep pushing myself\u00a0 to do it. After being out for a walk on a morning, I find I drop off to sleep after lunch, where I stay for 2 hours or more. For some reason I find I sleep better upright in an armchair, that I do propped\u00a0 up in bed.\u00a0 The other day I slept through a door bell and telephone ringing\u00a0 and never heard anything at all. My wife said that these days I\u00a0 will sleep through a bomb attack I never realised just how fast this illness Bronchiectasis, can take hold and take over your life. I have noticed that I have become agitated and short tempered, which I guess is down to the frustration of not being able to carry on being as active as I was, and could also be linked to tiredness and the constant coughing during the day and night I understand that you can get depressed with these illnesses, and I am starting to understand this now, but again I think it's down to being held back by your illness and feeling totally useless at timesI use a nebuliser every morning,\u00a0 to try to empty my lungs of this rubbish, but it starts all over again, while I am walking around and this is embarrassing as is the constant coughing But the nebuliser also gets my ventolin into my lungs faster than using a basic inhaler, so that is good. I have noticed at times that I feel as if I am trying to breathe through a drinking straw, and this gets harder trying to walk up a slight Hill. This is all made worse by the fact that I cannot get rid of the Heamopholis Influenza bug in my lungs.I understand that children can get vaccinated against this in the USA, but there is nothing as I understand it for adults and elderly in the UKEven the flu vaccination makes things much worse these days, but this something we are not warned aboutAs with other illnesses you are left to find your own way after a diagnosis, as there is\u00a0 little or no good quality\u00a0 information given at the time I know that there are charities dealing with this illness, but\u00a0 are all different with different problems and symptoms, so I guess that there is\u00a0 no simple answer I guess that it's hard for others to understand these chest problems, but there is a total lack of understanding and stigma, thinking that it's all caused by smoking,\u00a0 so it's your own fault However as we all know smoking is not always the cause, it could well be down to working in\u00a0 industrial industries and pollution etc. ",

I was told that I should have waited for 10 days before having this vaccination because it could have\u00a0 caused problems So just who do you believe in This? I told this staff member that I had COPD / Bronchiectasis and struggled with recurring chest infections, so it's hard to recognise when it's a safe time you get this vaccination.My problem is that these infections usually start around 6 - 8 weeks after the previous one, so it's hard to get an appointment at the doctors which fits in with these nightmares.To me there must be a guideline for these injections and chest infections, and I cannot believe that different doctors have different sets of rules.The only thing I can think of, is that the doctors have decided, that we should have the vaccination and put up with the risks as and when they appear. Or perhaps in this case there is never a good time for this Perhaps with these lung problems, there is never a totally safe time to have a flu vaccination My only concern is that if like me, you have the heamophilis influenza bug in your lungs already,\u00a0 are you asking for more problems by having a flu vaccination like this. Or is there a risk if you add more of the same bug into the already infected system I am not a doctor nor do I know a lot about COPD and Bronchiectasis, but I find this all very confusing ",

        "content": "Dementia and the spiritual needs of the person with the illnessWhen I was first approached to do this talk, I had looked at the title quite a few times, as it is a subject which to me is very difficult to put into words, especially when you are living with dementia. For inspiration I looked on the internet to try to get some answers to a subject which, in some cases causes a lot of upset. However I must point out that this is my own version of what this topic means, and it should never be assumed that everyone else is the same. There are over 120 variations of this illness, and no two people are the same. We are all individuals, on individual journeys, and therefore each person\u2019s spirituality is totally different.But here we go and I hope I get it right.Spirituality, leads to a purpose in life, in the things we value, and what is more, gives us all \u201cHope\u201d as without it we would be lostIt\u2019s not tied to any religious belief or tradition, although culture and beliefs can play a part in spirituality, every person has their own unique experience and journey However to lay people like myself Spirituality is something which can be difficult to define, and analyse, but it is generally understood to mean, feelings or beliefs related to the search for meaning and purpose in life. In this day and age it may or may not include a belief in a higher power (such as a god or several gods) or the supernatural world, as each person searches for meaning in life in their own way, but spiritual beliefs, usually bring together ideas about ourselves, our relationship with others and with the world. Religion is closely linked with spirituality, but the two words mean different things, a person may have an active spiritual life without considering themselves to be religious or being involved with a religious organization. When I was first diagnosed as having dementia, I lost my job as an engineer, a job I had held for 30 years, along with my home which went with the job, as I was on call 24 hours a day. Then a few days later my Mother died. At that time, I felt as if I was going to lose everything in life.Yet something kept me going. My \u201cFAITH\u201d and that little word \u201cHOPE\u201d What is more I may have dementia but I still have a good idea as to what I want from life and what I expect from others.So where do we startMost people these days are encouraged to write their life story, once they have been diagnosed with dementia, although this is better done in the early stages of the illness. This life story tells the reader whether it is a family member or a member of nursing or care staff, who we are, and where we came from, what we did in life, who we married, and who our grandchildren are.It should also take in things like, what we enjoyed in life, including our religion, if in deed we are religious, our hobbies and things we get so much pleasure out of.However my own life story took off and took on epic proportions, as the gates opened and the memories flooded back, usually at times when I could not write them down. But staff and carers may learn from this, that the person loved spending quiet time outdoors, visiting gardens, etc. In this situation, the care provider should work hard to facilitate access, to this type of environment.Only with time can care staff come to understand what a person is trying to say and to grasp the expressions \u2013 so often non-verbal \u2013 that have a possible spiritual meaning. This includes encouraging care staff to take an interest in the life story of the person with dementia, and make links to possible spiritual needs. However as the brain disease progresses, we are unable to do many of the things we loved doing, before the illness started, and this in turn changes the way we see things and changes things like our taste. This story should take on board the changes we come across after the diagnosis, and many people forget this, simply don\u2019t understand it, or put it down to the person with the illness being awkward.To many around us it may seem as if we are trying to change the rules, but it\u2019s our brain which has changed, and that on its own is very frightening to us when we realise, what is happening to us.How many times have you heard a carer or fairly member say that the person with dementia has stopped eating certain foods, or does not want to do something they have done for years prior to the illness? Many think we are being stubborn or awkward, but it could be down to the changes in our brains Yet there could be a very good reason for that as I noticed, and it was a shock, when the changes were noticed.I was always what some could call old fashioned in what I ate, if we went to a Chinese restaurant, I would never ever, eat a curry but would have a steak.These days, I could eat anything including Chinese and Indian Curries, every day without being tired of it, that\u2019s if I was given the chance, what is more, the hotter and spicy they are the better. So what happened after the diagnosis to allow these changes to occur, I simply don\u2019t know, but my taste in food has changed completely?However some people have been known to revert back to foods they ate as children and that could be a shock to family members alone including our loved ones who are acting as our carers.My tastes in music have changed completely too, as before I was happy listening to classical music and some pop music, but now like many of my friends with dementia, I like rock music like Freddy Mercury and Queen, along with other artists like Eric Clapton? Very StrangeMy political views seem to have changed too which to me was a total shock, but it\u2019s safer not to go into that one.So if this happens it has to be taken on board, it\u2019s simply not good enough to say that the person has always liked this and that\u2019s what they will have or do. In many ways I am not the same person that my wife married in the 1970s, and I am not alone, once this illness gets you. Before this illness I could never stand up and speak, the mere though used to make me shake with fear, and that was before I got anywhere near to standing up, now I spend a lot of time giving talks, so am I the same person that I was before the diagnosis, certainly notHowever one thing which has never changed is this. I love watching nature; I love animals and birds etc., and delight in watching all creatures in world today. However it is vital to find out more about the unique individual who has dementia, and about their preferences, and then find ways in which the person can be spiritually nourished.I also like photography, although my use of the camera settings is very, hit and miss, these days, but the results can be interesting, as a friend with dementia living in Scotland said once.He was very good at one stage, and now through his insight into dementia, he has been able to show established photographers that people with dementia see life in a vastly different way to the rest of the world. This gentleman now has photographic exhibitions in Scotland.However there are many misconceptions about Dementia.That this illness is age related? So what about the thousands of people under the age of 65 who have a diagnosis of dementia There well over 16,000 people under the age of 65 who have this illness, some in their 30s.People with dementia cannot speak, or take an active part?People with dementia are unable to get involvedThese are all things which help keep this horrible stigma which is attached to dementia alive.How wrong can they be, and perhaps this is why many places, care homes, religious places, etc. are not encouraged to make things easier for us to get involved Please remember that these people may not say a lot, but their actions speak volumes. I always remember seeing people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease at meetings, they rarely said much, perhaps due to pressure of getting things right in their minds.In some cases their wives or family spoke up for them, without thinking and allowing the person time to speak for themselves. But their actions did all of the answering, nodding, smiling or giving a thumbs up in agreement, or shaking their heads or hands when they disagreed. They still had feelings, ideas, of what was happening, and what is more they still have a sense of purpose and the meaning of life, along with that small word with a big meaning HOPE.This has always stuck in my memory, and proved that they knew exactly what was being said, even though they could not speak. A good quality of life is something we all cherish, and this should be encouraged among those who have this illness, and those who care for us.I used to get a lot of pleasure going to church until this illness started, then I found that I could not remember the Lord\u2019s Prayer, something which was horrifying at the time. So I changed services at the church where we lived in Oxford, as it was much quieter, which allowed me to think, and it was more personalI had been a Christian all of my life with a strong belief, although I was not a regular attender at church because I was on call 24 hours a day, and did not want the pager to go off in the service. Eventually after losing my job, we moved back to the family home in North East, where I was re-diagnosed, as the first hospital had lost my notes within those three months.I was given medication which allowed me to think a bit clearer, and after a while I started to remember most of the words, which was marvelous, until I started to go back to the church I was brought up in.It was then that I realised that the words I had learnt, bore no resemblance to the service, as they used a different format at each service, and what was worse, was the fact that they had started to sing it rather than say it. I suppose the main thing to remember is that, although I was used to being able to understand many big words at work, old and new, I don\u2019t always know what they mean these days, so many words used in services these days don\u2019t mean a lotMy main problem was that I had lost the ability to sing and read words when I was in church etc., and I also had problems singing hymns and psalms, as I took time to remember the tune, but could not tie the tunes to the words, and even today I still struggle. Yet each service was vastly different and there seemed to be so many variations of things like the Lord\u2019s Prayer that I started to wonder what was going on, as this was making my life difficult to keep up with.I also have problems with my hearing which at times is acute, and this meant that I could hear other people talking most of the way through the service when I was trying to concentrate, so I was missing large parts of the service. Not so many years ago, people would have had more respect and would have remained quiet, so that others could hear what was going on. But that is now gone and no matter where you are, there is always someone else trying to get their point across, rather than let people listen to the speaker. These days life is made harder by the mobile phones, which always seem to go off when you are thinkingThis acute hearing is so bad at times that I can hear a conversation at the other end of a railway carriage, but struggle to hear what is said by the person sat next to me. Some may say that this is selective hearing, but it\u2019s very distressing at times because I don\u2019t wish to hear what other people were doing last night, as it\u2019s embarrassing.I have also lost the ability to understand things like messages and e-mails, which was distressing, yet how many people would understand my dilemma. I sometimes read them three or four times, and this usually gives me a different answer each time, so in the end I have to ask my wife what it means.We also see so many variations of each copy of books like the bible, many written in modern day language, and this all adds to confusion, when you have an illness like dementia.However these days, I do feel that many religions including the \"Church of England\u201d are trying hard to attract youngsters into the church at the expense of the elderly and those who have dementia, and I find that very upsetting as to many people with dementia their religion means so much They are the elderly and those with neurological illness. However I do feel that churches etc., should take on board that, the older generation were taught these forms of service when we were young, and these constant changes help no one.Some Clergy seem to think that those in the care homes don't sing or say their prayers so why bother? So when these priests go to care homes, they find that those with memory problems do not know the words and loose interest, however Lay people who use traditional Lord\u2019s Prayer and Psalms get responses. So do these people really know why people with dementia and memory problems, are in care homes, and what is more important do they understand the basics of our illness.I did think this was because they had forgotten one major factor, and that is people, as they get older and those with early onset dementia, remember the services they were taught either in church, chapel or at school assemblies. They should also remember that we don\u2019t want long winded sermons, because we all lose interest, but make it short and to the point, and use the scriptures where needed. As our old Canon used to say, you need to get your sermon through clearly to the congregation in 10 Minutes, in a way they can understand it. I think this is the same for most things these days, don\u2019t confuse us with too much; make it short and to the point. However one day in sheer desperation I sat down, and after many days, I had written a letter to a Bishop explaining the problems associated with neurological illness and changes to church services, included also was my problem of sleep patterns.  I did this because I was misguided enough to believe that a Bishop would be sympathetic and understanding, but what I shock I got when I got his response. He more or less told me to get up on a Sunday morning, and go to 8am Communion, where they used the Book of Common Prayer, and I would have no further problems. He obviously did not take on board that I have sleep problems with very graphic and distressing nightmares, which can go on for over an hour and some nights more, and then usually go into a deep sleep around 5am as I had told him. This made me understand that many in society do not understand dementia so we must make allowances for them even though it can be hurtful, but through perseverance we will educate them all about the illness in timeBut life as we know it changes when you get this diagnosisWhen a person receives a diagnosis of dementia their spiritual and religious beliefs may be shaken or even lost, as the person asks, \u2018why me\u2019, what have I done to deserve this illness, and carers should be alert to this possibility. On the other hand some people with dementia and their carers may develop a new or renewed interest in faith and religious practices, when they are faced with crisis. Hope can bring meaning in a person\u2019s life and help them face difficult times without despair.It is future orientated, and experiencing hope, provides strength to cope with painful and stressful events, such as receiving a diagnosis of dementia.Many of us, live in hope that the medication, we may be taking may help improve our condition or even cure us. Many like myself have prayed for a cure, and this helps us to hang on to our beliefsFinding hope is a means of coping with this illness, and what is happening to our lives, and professionals need to be aware that even when hope is unrealistic, people must find their own way to make their own meaning.However not everyone can speak, so we have to make allowances for everyone.Most people with this illness also feel very isolated and alone at times, even when we have family around us, but this is because we cannot explain ourselves at times, or get the right words out and this is distressing. Sometimes my brain goes blank and I cannot think about anything clearly.Sometimes the words just flow but in the wrong order, and that puts a different meaning on what we were trying to say. Some people like myself panic when being asked a question on the spur of the moment and the wrong words flow. I was once accused of being angry when I was asked a question, but that was totally wrong. I just went into panic mode and said what I thought was right, but I was wrong. So please allow us time to think slowly before answering your questions, and never answer your own questions, as that is very rude and patronising. Spatial awareness also plays a major part in each of our lives, and must be remembered, so please respect that because things can go wrong if you get too close at the wrong time. Sometimes we just need a little bit of time in our own area, without anyone coming in and disturbing us, and this is our comfort zone.Nightmares are horrific and sometimes difficult to wake up from. If you see anyone having one of these, please talk quietly to the person but never get too close because otherwise, you could become a part of that nightmare and end up being hurt, as my wife once found to her horrorI do think these days that life moves far too fast for those with this illness and it\u2019s difficult to keep up, especially when you have fixed ideas in your brain. As well as that many people simply don\u2019t understand this illness and just push it to one side, so we must now change people\u2019s attitudes and views on dementia then we will certainly become a dementia friendly society. We are getting there, but it needs a bigger push to get most if not all of society onboard. Through all of this I have realised that those of us with this illness, struggle to keep up with what is a very fast life these days, and as a friend in Indonesia says,It seems like a swan going up stream in a river, on the surface it seems to be keeping up with the water, but under the water, its legs are going flat out to keep up. In other words we all look normal on the outside, but our brains are going flat out to keep up with what is happening around us on a daily basis. But please rememberWe still have feelings, ideas, of what was happening, and what is more they still have a sense of purpose and the meaning of life, along with that small word with a big meaning \u201cHOPE\u201d",

Many people blame the doctors, but I do wonder if the blame lies within the Department of Health, It is said that the system was a failure from day one, but like may people I do feel, that it's the Department of Health officials who changed the system so much, that it had no chance of succeeding, or it was done on the cheap Now we have ended up with a complete shambles.It's not the first time that I have gone for a hospital appointment to find, that my records were either missing, or they were not accessible by the consultant who was treating me I gather that another reason for this problem, is down to the failure of different hospital trusts sharing a patients information with others This leaves me asking what really happened to our beloved National Health Service, which used to work so well Obviously those people working on this system care little about the patients who go to appointments only to find that their records are not there Not only is this unforgivable, but to me it shows that these officials really don't care about our health service, nor do they care about the stress they cause.This means that the patient has to repeat themselves at every appointment, and have your carry a list of their medications with them to every hospital appointment, simply because it's not on the system This came to a head recently when I was sent to see a chest consultant.We were given the choice if three hospitals where I could see a consultant.So we chose the first one on the list, thinking that thus would move things on faster.But when we arrived we found that the consultant could not access my records or the recent chest xrays.Things have got to such a state now, that I have had a new appointment to see a different chest consultant at a local hospital, so it will be interesting to see if he can access my records and xrays I live in hope that things will improve before long",

        "content": "These days it is not so easy for people with dementia or memory problems to retain the spiritual beliefs, as many church leaders are simply not interested I always remember a curate at church telling me, that it was a waste of his time going into care homes, because those living there were not interested and just went to sleep while he was there What he meant was, they were not interested in his modern forms of service, because they were brought up with the old forms of service, using old well known hymns and prayers.I think with his sermons, many people would have lost the will to stay awake as they were long winded and boring I personally found this comment to be a total insult, because he simply had not got a clue as to how he could react with these people, but apparently, this is the modern church..Church leaders these days consider the word spirituality to mean 100% religious beliefs and nothing else.But in reality a person's spirituality these days, is about who the person is, and how they want to be treated, along with what they enjoy so much in lifeThis is something I spoke about a couple of years ago at a conference, and it was well received, although it took me nearly a month to get it clear in my head before the event, because spirituality means so many things, to different people these days If I can find it, I will repost it later. Yes they may be very religious, with one form of religion or belief, but like many people I was brought up with the older forms of service and enjoyed this way of life .These days there are many groups being set up by and for people with memory and neurological illnesses, who are interested in retaining their religious beliefs, and are supported by clergy from one domination or another, or can be done in short by reading from a book One such book is one that I have at home and is called Worshipping with DementiaA book that I mentioned to the curate that I wrote about before.This book contains Meditations, Scriptures, and Prayers for people with dementia and their carers The book was Edited by Louise Morsels. This covers scriptures and short sermons, and not long winded ones as we hear in churches these days. It should get remembered that many of us do not have the attention span we used to have, and many of us simply switch off after a while What is more, I know that like many others, my memory is total rubbish these days, and if I don't write something down fast, it's gone for hours or sometimes days, before I remember it againI always remember the Canon at our church, when I was in the choir as a boy, telling the congregation, that if a priest could not say what he wanted with 10 mins, he simply could not do a sermon and was in the wrong Job? His idea was that a sermon should be short and you the point, otherwise people would drift off to sleep with boredom.This is one thing that many clergy simply forget when doing services in care homes etc, because they are not trained to cope with the elderly, or those with neurological illnesses any more.

Not all are like this, as I am well aware, but there are many who are.These people had agreed with my wife, and then told her that they would deny anything she said, if it got back to the clergy To me, this clergyman was rude and arrogant when he came to our home to confront my wife, so much so that I walked out rather than get upset at what was happeningIf this is the way clergy treat people, os it any wonder that churches are left empty these daysI for one used to love the Church of England and going to church, but now I will not go near to it at all.Perhaps it's time that the Bishops took more notice of these things, and sorted themselves outWe are at the end if the day in the 21st century not the 7th However not all is lost, because I have a book of forms is service for people like us, and I follow it as and when I can. This was written solely for people with dementia and memory problems, and it's all that I now need. But perhaps this us too basic for modern day clergymen ",

        "content": "The other day I was having a conversation with an elderly clergyman.We were discussing various things, and then I said that I no longer attend churches because the services are all so very different.He questioned what I meant by this, not pushing his views, but he was interested in my reasons for giving up my religion.I say giving up my religion!But I am still a Christian, even though I never attend a church service these days, and as far as that is concerned, I like many thousands of others are still very religious even if we no longer go inside a church.It's a long story I said, but it started around 12 years ago when I realised that my memory was going.Until this time I has always been very religious, and as a boy in the church choir, I would attend three services perhaps each Sunday.As an engineer I would go to church, but I would carry a pager for emergencies, and would leave the service if it went off.How ever 12 years ago I started to forget how to do my job, something which shocked me, and I got very distressed because I did not understand what was happening.All of my electrical training was disappearing, and it felt as if a virus had wiped my memory completely.I was then very ill with Pnuemonia and my memory took a hammering again.One day I went to church and realised that I no longer remembered the Lords Prayer.I was totally devastated at this, and try as I might, I just could not remember the words.When you forget the things like this, that you learnt as a child it can be very upsetting, and even worse when coupled with forgetting his to do your jobAfter trying for a few months, going over and over the words, I started to get to grips with it, and I felt really proud of myself.However the next time my wife and I went to church I realised that the words of the Lords Prayer were totally different?But I said I will push myself to go in the hope of getting the words right.But then I heard that the church used a different version of this Lords prayer at every service, and to make things even worse, there were occasions when they would sing it.I had learnt to sing and follow music as a child, but now I find it difficult to read the words while following the music.As a boy chorister I remember singing Handles Messiah in Durham Catherdral. This was done by our own church choir, the Cathdreal choristers and another choir.I vaguely remember this, but nowvI am unable to sing properly, and unable to read music.In a vane attempt to sort things out, because memory lose, is something that thousands struggle with, I spoke to the local priest, but he just shrugged his shoulders and said that he could do nothing about it.I then said, what about all of the elderly congregation with memory problems, people who attend every week, and pay your salary.But I got no answer. So obviously the elderly and those with memory problems are nothing to do with the church.To add insult to injury, I was once accused is staying with the past and not keeping up with modern times.But we were taught the original forms of service and prayers as children, yet here it was being thrown out with the bath water so to speak.At this time I had serious problems sleeping because of graphic nightmares, and would only go into a deep sleep at around 5-6 in the morning.So I grasped the nettle by the thorns, and wrote to the local Bishop, explaining about my struggles with memory and nightmares.When I got his reply I realised that the church simply did not care about anyone who has memory problems etc.He simply told me to get up and attend the 8am service every Sunday, because it was all done to the original prayer book style, which I who remember.I was so disgusted that I turned my back on my religion, or going to church.This proved to me that even the so called caring Church of England, cared little or nothing for those of us with memory problems.After I had finished the elderly priest looked at me and said that he agreed with everything I had said, and had himself tried to get things sorted out, because the church is relying on the elderly etc, to keep the churches going.He also agreed that the Church of England etc, had brought problems on themselves by forgetting the very people that they should be looking afterSo is it any wonder that those with memory problems or dementia, refuse to attend church these days, because it's become alien to them.Is it any wonder that churches are empty these days?Had it not have been for my daughter telling me about voice activated computer software, I would not be using a computer to keep myself active these days.",

        "content": "The other day, we heard that millions of pounds was being poured into the London Police services, to protect us from security risks.Later that very day in London, a lady was murdered and other people were badly injured, by someone who appears to be struggling with mental health issues.This sadly is not the first murder involving someone with mental health issues in the last few months, but no one takes any notice.Had it have been someone acting as a terrorist, the government would have thrown a lot of money and resources at it.Before the European vote took place, the Government pledged to invest millions of pounds more into the mental health services, but one has to ask where it's all gone and where are the improvementsFor some odd reason this money seems to have disappeared into the NHS and never got to the right place.To me this is the governments fault, because when it puts money into a service, the money is never ring fenced to prevent it bring used for something elseWe saw this with the National Dementia Strategy, when money was put aside for dementia, but the then Government refused to ring fence the money, and it was then used to pay for other services, yet no one was held accountable.Mental health has been a very poor relation for many years. In fact ever since the mental Heath hospitals were closed down in the 1960s, yet nothing has improvedYet when we look at mental Heath, it involves many Illnesses. There isdepression in a lot of other illnesses, but all the doctors are interested in doing is dishing out anti depressants, many of which do more harm than good.But mental health goes a lot deeper than politicians care to admit these days.One or two Politicians have openly admitted to having mental health issues, only to be vilified by other politicians, and that shows the contempt they have for mental Heath these days.I think a lot if the problems are caused by the stigma which is attached to mental health issues, because for years no one would admit they, or anyone in their family had mental health problems.In many ways it was like cancer in the 1950-60s, and dementia now.But people are starting to admit to their illnesses more, and talk to others about them, instead of hiding them. I think it's helped by the high profile people like Actors, Politicians and Athletes, who are openly talking about mental health.Here again it's a subject which could be discussed in schools, so that youngsters get to know about it and understand what it is.Yes there are still one or mental health hospitals in existence but these are few and far between.This means that it takes longer to access the system, and then they and family members have to travel many miles when it comes to visiting.To me it stands to reason that if the mental health services were improved, people with these issues would be picked up faster, saving the government a lot of money.The only way all health problems can be addressed is to start revamping the NHS, and taking back control of it rather than allowing private companies etc, to take over many if the best services.Mental health has always been around like dementia, but these illnesses have never been given the priority or the resources that they require.I also feel that people were better served when hospitals worked under the older system, where they were run by doctors and nurses etc, rather than business bosses, because like it or not a hospital cannot be run like a business. If a hospital got into problems those in charge took the blame, and never blamed others.In those days each hospital was part of a group and shared their services including mental health, so in many cases, the NHS was a much better place, as it was run by people with medical experience rather than some cost cutting chief executive, who has little interest in an efficient hospital.If the hospital fails they are always protected and blame everyone else.In this day and age we hear that a patients records can be shared around the local hospitals, but in all honesty, that is total rubbish. Because it's not the first time I have gone to a hospital to find that they were unable to access my records. So after the millions of pounds poured into this service to speed it up, it's a total failureIn all honestly I do feel that these days, the NHS is too top heavy with admin staff, and this now needs to be addressed so that the money goes where it's needed, and that is on patient services, not on meetings for people in big office blocks who keep reinventing the wheel, and certainly not on chief executives who look after them selves and no one else.Let us hope that mental health starts to get the money it really needs in the future, so that those in real need are picked up and given the treatment they deserve.Whether we like it or not mental health is not self inflicted like some illnesses, and therefore it should be given more resources and supportI do admit that a lot of these services have been lost by the savage government, over the last ten years, but hopefully this will soon be readdressed.",

Now we are seeing what happens when these over paid and well educated politicians try to cause troubleWe don't need to listen to the likes of Donald Trumphere in the UK, we have our own set of idiots involved with the BRITEX team like Boris Johnson and NigelFarage, who have done so much damagenow that its unacceptable to modern day society, or the society that I grew up to love and respectI feel totally sick at the treatment and abuse being thrown at the Polish community over the last few weeks.Many ignore or forget that many Polish people came here to fight along side the troops of  this country during the last world war. Many gave their lives for this country and they have my total respect Some stayed on and worked along the British people and were respected ... They did not come here to scrounge or demand benefits as many of our racist politicians tell us these days. Yes they may have a different culture and like other foods, but so do the British when they go abroad either to holiday or to live. But these people work along side British people, and they pay their taxes here, which is something that many politicians refuse to do.  They do not bank abroad or hide their money abroad well away from the British tax authorities. Yesterday I was in Newcastle where I saw racist signs in telephone boxes, which had been ripped down, because they caused offence not just to the Polish people but also to many British people. It was still obvious what had been written, and I feel offended that some in  this country, need to do this for nothing more than pure hatred  I admit that many hate those who come to this country and who refuse to work and want benefits, but that is for the government to sort out. Mr Blair opened the flood gates and allowed this to happen when he was in Power  He himself go rid of the barriers, and allowed anyone to enter the UK including the notorious case of the one legged roofer? This was not the European Parliaments doing but Tony Blair.   Besides which there are hundreds of thousands of British people who have refused to work, all of their lives, yet they get away without and abuse Over the years I have known and lived near to many Polish people as well as people from other nationalities, all of who have worked hard in this country and done their bit. So it's time that these racists were named and shamed, in the hope that we can stop this disgusting behaviour. The British always had pride in everything they did, but now it seems that some what to force changes.  This country was one of the worst countries in years gone by, because they invaded other countries and exploited their wealth, yet this is largely forgotten or hidden away. This is who our commonwealth started up, and this covered vast areas of the world. So before we complain about some coming to our country we should remember our history.  You can not exploit other people's countries, then try to stop them coming here. Just remember that many of these  politicians who talk about mass immigration,  are usually immigrants from other countries themselves.

I have a feeling that the book is still in our house and has been read by three of our grandchildren.But if you cannot laugh at yourself and see the funny side of things like this, then you may as well give up completely.But in all honesty, I guess that after two hours of eye tests in one go, I was extremely tired, so I needed to have something to laugh at. So now it's a case of doing things like writing on bigger screens while I can still do it, but I think that I will be doing less online stuff for the time being, until I find out what is happening.",

I confess that the television box bottom fell out, but I suppose it's really my fault for not having my hand under the box as I carried it.The weather was lovely but I had two very bad nights, and in the end we were close to coming home early, but I wanted to try a third night.That third night all went off well and I slept through without any problems.We had a lovely relaxing weekend, with lovely weather and that made up for a terrible week.Now we are home and back to normal again.

It also causes problems if it's a friend walking towards you, and then it's embarrassing not being able to recognise them from a short distance.Or walking towards a doorway can cause problems because I either hit the doorframe or the door handles causing bruises to the arms.Things like walking through a doorframe is something we all take for granted, until one day when you hit the side and find people looking at you as if you are drunk or stupidThese days coping with fast moving people and trollies in supermarkets can be horrendous on some days. On some days I find it hard when children come up from behind of in front of my on these shoes with wheels on there heels etc. I suppose it's because they move so fast and my brain cannot keep up with things anymore.However eyesight or visual perception has caused many other concerns over the years because, I cannot read something like an email, and get the true meaning each time. Some times my brain tells me one thing, while in all honesty the email is saying something else. This means that unless my wife checks it, I can sometimes send back the wrong reply.So these days all documents are read by my wife, and then she explains them to me. I can see the time coming when things like the blog, Twitter and Facebook etc, will be closed down, because they will be too difficult to use.I admit that this will be very hard, but I would rather give up than end up looking sillyI remember using lots of big words while I was working, now I simply don't understand what they mean, and end up asking my wife. It's hard to imagine that one word can cause so many problems, because the brain tells me that it's one thing, then when I look at it again, I see something else.Even listening to the radio or television, I have to ask what something means.",

I do not always say this, because there are times when I try to write things using the keyboard as normal. This is an old post which has been sitting waiting to be checked for mistakes, although with my eyes and brain I do not always see themEarly on before my diagnosis of early onset Lewy Body Dementia, I realised that my coordination was going wrong.This happened at work, but as I was on call 24 hours a day I put it down to tiredness at times, but then I realised that it must be something else.It seemed to start with using tools, then I noticed that I had problems typing on the computer.This caused problems because it meant that some reports took longer than expected, because something had reversed, and although I hand been right handed all of my life, my left hand had now become faster and this caused problemsIt meant that although the letters of each word were there, they were all mixed up, like some sort of code.I still have no idea what has happened, because this has never been looked at by any doctor even though it's been mentioned a few times.One consultant at a dementia clinic thought that something had reversed in my brain, but could not be sure. An MRI scan done later on, said something about cerebral atrophy and TIA but nothing was discussed after this, as the doctors changed, so we were left with no informationabout these resultsTo get over this typing problem,I had to sit on one hand and type with the other, something which was frustrating after typing with two hands at workEventually my daughter suggested using voice activated software on the computer. At first we tried the version on my laptop which was Microsoft, but this had problems because it did not understand accents in the UK.After further talks with my daughter who is a biologist, it was decided that I should try the Dragonvoice activated software, which I gather is used by the NHS.We bought this and loaded it onto the computer, and started the trial testing. This was stressful at times, because of the setting up, and getting it to understand the words.At one stage in desperation, I swore at the thing, and saw a row of question marks, at which stage I started to laugh, and confess that I never had any more trouble with it again, until I had problems with the computer and had to reload all of the software againTo me this has been a godsendbecause its so good and relieves much of the stress of trying to typeYes its expensive, but when your brain goes haywire, I think we have to use anything we can to help ourselves and make life as easy as possibleSo now nearly every blogpost I do is written using this software. Yes there are still mistakes, when the softwarethinks I have said one thing instead of something else, but then its down to my and this brain to find the faults and correct themOne thing I have realised is that the tone of my voice changes on odd days, and this causes odd problems. I have no idea what causes these tone changes, but I guess its all part of life",

        "content": "I have had a lot of problems with my eyes recently, and this has helped me to understand it much better. Now I need to speak to the Parkinson's Nurse about thisPeople with Parkinson\u2019s often experience problems with their eyes and eyesight.1 Some of these problems may be due to Parkinson\u2019s itself, or Parkinson\u2019s medication, but they may also be due to other causes.This information sheet looks at the common eye problems you may experience, such as blurred vision and glaucoma, and looks at other causes and possible solutions. Who treats eye problems?Ophthalmologists \u2013 are medically trained doctors. They examine, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries in and around the eye. They also perform operations on the eye.Optometrists \u2013 examine eyes and give advice on visual problems. They also prescribe and fit glasses or contact lenses. They usually work in the high street, but may also work in a hospital eye service. Some have a role in caring for patients with stable, long-term (chronic) eye conditions.Orthoptists \u2013 diagnose and treat vision problems and abnormal eye movement. They are usually part of a hospital care team looking after people with eye problems. If you are having problems with your vision, you should speak to your GP or specialist. You can also speak to your Parkinson\u2019s nurse, if you have one. A Parkinson\u2019s nurse is a qualified registered general nurse with specialist experience, knowledge and skills in Parkinson\u2019s. They play a vital role in the care of people with Parkinson\u2019s. You can read more about them on page 5.Your GP, specialist or Parkinson\u2019s nurse may suggest that you visit the relevant eye and vision health professional to help treat your problem. How often should I get an eye test?If you have Parkinson\u2019s, it is recommended that you attend regular eye exams with an optometrist, at least once a year, even if you aren\u2019t experiencing any specific problems with your eyes. You may find it helpful to tell them you have the condition, so they can look Parkinson\u2019s can affect your ability to move parts of the body, including your eyes. So you may have difficulties when starting to move your eyes or when trying to move them quickly.2,3 It may be more noticeable when looking at a fast-moving object, such as when watching moving cars or a tennis match. Sometimes, instead of a smooth movement, your eyes may move in a slow and jerky way.2 This can make certain activities, such as driving, more difficult. If this happens talk to your GP, specialist or Parkinson\u2019s nurse because Parkinson\u2019s medication may help.2 Difficulties in moving the eyes up or down are more common in a condition called progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), which is a form of parkinsonism (an umbrella term that describes many conditions that share some of the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s).4 If you are experiencing this problem, your specialist or Parkinson\u2019s nurse will be able to give you advice. Find out more: see our booklet Driving and Parkinson\u2019s and information sheet Parkinsonism. Blurred visionBlurred vision can be caused by difficulty moving the eyes.2 But it can also be a side effect of Parkinson\u2019s medication,2 particularly anticholinergics (such as Disipal, Arpicolin, and Broflex).5 Blurred vision may happen when you start taking anticholinergic drugs and may improve with time as your body gets used to the medication.5 But it can also happen after you\u2019ve been taking the drugs for a long time or when an adjustment has been made to the dosage. If blurred vision continues or gets worse, consult your GP, specialist or Parkinson\u2019s nurse. Don\u2019t stop taking your medication before seeking advice.If you wear reading glasses you may find it helpful to visit your optometrist. A slight change to your prescription might improve blurred vision. Find out more: see our booklet Drug treatment for Parkinson\u2019s.Double Vision Doe visionuble vision is seeing two images of a single object some or all of the time. The two images may be one on top of the other, side by side, or a mix of both.6 This is also often caused by problems moving the eyes.2 Some people with Parkinson\u2019s experience \u2018tracking\u2019. This is when the eyes do not move smoothly across a line or from one object to another, for example moving across a page when reading, or up and down.2 Poor co-ordination and fatigue of the muscles that move the eyeballs can mean that the eyes do not quite move together.2 This can cause double vision.2There are also causes of double vision (a common and usually minor eye condition) that are nothing to do with having Parkinson\u2019s, such as thyroid problems, diabetes, or an astigmatism in one eye.7 If the problem continues, see your optometrist for advice. or ask your GP or specialist if you can be referred to an ophthalmologist for further tests. Slight changes in your glasses prescription may also help with this.Dry eyesPeople with Parkinson\u2019s may blink less often than other people.2 Blinking helps to clean the eyes by removing dust and dirt. If you blink less often these can build up, making the eyes dry or sore. Dry eyes can have other causes, so see your optometrist for advice.8 They may suggest you try artificial tears. These are available from pharmacies and may help reduce discomfort and dryness.9\u201cMy wife has been having problems for some time with her eyes after taking her medication. At last I can put a name to the problem. It\u2019s called \u2018blepharospasm\u2019. This is a side effect of the medication but quite rare.\u201d Graham, a carer for his wife who has Parkinson\u2019sInvoluntary closure of the eyelids (blepharospasm)Blepharospasm occurs when the muscle that closes the eyelid contracts or goes into spasm. This can cause repeated twitching of the eyelid or difficulty in keeping the eyelid open. Sometimes the eyelid may close completely.10 The cause and treatment of blepharospasm are complex because levodopa, one of the main drugs used to treat Parkinson\u2019s, may cause it,2 but on other occasions these drugs can help to improve it.11 In mild cases, simply rubbing the eyelids may help. Sometimes, injections of botulinum toxin (botox) are used to treat blepharospasm.10Blepharospasm is more common in parkinsonism than Parkinson\u2019s.12 Your GP, specialist, or Parkinson\u2019s nurse can offer you more advice. \u201cI often think I see someone or a dark shadow out of the corner of my eye and experience flashes and pulsing of light in low light conditions. This has been confirmed by my ophthalmologist as an optic nerve problem due to Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d JC, diagnosed in 2006HallucinationsSome people with Parkinson\u2019s may have visual hallucinations.3 This is where they see things that aren\u2019t there, such as flickering lights, objects, people or animals.2 It is more common in those who have had Parkinson\u2019s for a long time.2 It may be partly due to Parkinson\u2019s itself and partly to the medication that is used to treat it.2 Older people and those with memory (cognitive) problems are more likely to have hallucinations.13If you are experiencing visual disturbances, your specialist may suggest reducing or changing your Parkinson\u2019s medication.3 If the hallucinations keep happening there are other treatments that can help.If you\u2019re experiencing hallucinations, it is important to rule out causes other than Parkinson\u2019s, such as poor eyesight or bad lighting. The sudden onset of hallucinations may also be due to an infection or other illness.3 Speak to your healthcare professional if you are having hallucinations. Find out more: see our information sheet Hallucinations and delusions in Parkinson\u2019s.Other visual issuesProblems with low light levels (contrast sensitivity)You may find that it difficult to see in low light levels.2 You may also be unable to make out the shape of things clearly, such as a light-coloured object on a light background. This may also affect your ability to read fine print. Colour visionSome people with Parkinson\u2019s may have difficulty telling the difference between some colours.2 This problem may be worse for shades of blue or blue/green. Your colour vision may improve with Parkinson\u2019s medication.Spatial awarenessSome people with Parkinson\u2019s may have difficulty judging the space around them.2 They may not be able to judge the distance between objects, and may have problems when walking past objects2 or getting through a narrow space.14 Sometimes reaching out to touch the sides of doorways or other objects may help. An occupational therapist may be able to help with advice about organising your home or work space to help you manage this problem. Speak to your GP, specialist and Parkinson\u2019s nurse about a referral. Problems with spatial awareness can affect driving as well as walking so you may have to give up driving. You must tell DVLA if you\u2019ve got any problem with your eyesight that affects both of your eyes, or the remaining eye if you only have one eye. For more information visit gov.uk/driving-eyesight-rules or call 0300 790 6806. You can also speak to your health professional for advice.Find out more: see our booklet Driving and Parkinson\u2019s and information sheet Occupational therapy and Parkinson\u2019s.Seeing movementSome people with Parkinson\u2019s don\u2019t see movement accurately,2 and seem unable to judge the speed of moving objects such as traffic. If you experience this problem, try to take extra care when crossing roads or when driving. Speak to your health professional for advice.Problems with glassesIf you have Parkinson\u2019s, your posture may become stooped.15 This can cause problems if you wear glasses. If you often lean forward, then you might find that you end up looking over your frames instead, or your glasses may slip down. Your optician should be able to help you adjust your frames and lenses to suit your posture.Glaucoma and Parkinson\u2019s medicationGlaucoma is a type of eye disease that damages the optic nerve, which, if untreated, can lead to loss of sight.16 If you have glaucoma you may have problems with some Parkinson\u2019s medications, such as anticholinergic drugs and levodopa.17,18\u2018Open-angle\u2019 glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. It is called \u2018open-angle\u2019 because the angle between the iris and the cornea is open.16 If you have open-angle glaucoma there may be risks when using anticholinergic drugs.19 Where there is no other option you should discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using them with an ophthalmologist or a Parkinson\u2019s specialist, so that you can make a decision together about whether they\u2019re the right treatment for you. Anticholinergic drugs are not recommended for people who have the less common, closed-angle glaucoma,20 and levodopa (Sinemet and Madopar) should only be used with caution.21, 22Some dopamine agonists can have side effects that affect the eyes. For instance, rotigotine23 is not recommended for people who have closed-angle glaucoma. Yearly eye check-ups are recommended if you are using these drugs.It is helpful if your Parkinson\u2019s specialist and the ophthalmologist can work together when prescribing medication for you if you have glaucoma. So, if you have this condition, always tell your GP, specialist or Parkinson\u2019s nurse.Find out more: see our booklet Drug treatments for Parkinson\u2019s.More information and supportLook after your eyesThis website has been set up for the general public by the College of Optometrists.

But as luck would have it, all was well and I had not wet the bed.But these things are so realistic, that they can be remembered in great detail throughout the next day, and that is frightening.I was horrified when I hit my wife during one nights horrors, and she ended up with a black eye, which upset me, but it's not happened since.I think that she had tried to wake me up from the nightmare, and then became a part of it, so now she keeps well away and just talks to meI understand that this sort of thing could be related to Parkinson's disease, but whether that's correct or not I don't know, but I hope to find out next month.",

Now that's all gone, and no matter what I do I just cannot copy something like I used to do.I can start drawing something, but then I need to go back again, and again to correct it or change parts just to get there.I find this upsetting because I loved drawing and sketching as a hobby.My coordination has also gone these days, and I get upset with things like simple shopping bags.Just trying to get hold of the correct parts while hanging onto my walking stick, can be stressfulI gave up DIY projects because my coordination problems caused accidents at home, so it was decided that it was better to let things go completely, rather than end up in hospital.This first started a few years ago, when I was working, and being on call 24 hours a day, I would retire to my shed and use my wood turning lathe, something I really loved doing, until one day when things started to go wrong.As an engineer I was responsible for ensuring that all machines had emergency switches fitted so that a machine could be stopped in a hurry, as and when needed.This wood turning lathe had three extra switches on it for emergencies. But this day I tried to stop the machine be grabbing the high speed revolving wood block.This ended up with some very badly bruised fingers and hands. Luckily for me nothing was broken or taken off, but it was a warning that something was wrong.After one more attempt at using the lathe it was decided by my family, that it had to be dismantled in an attempt to stop me using it.But as the Consultant in the North East said one day. If something you have done for years fails, leave it and try another day.If it fails on the second day leave it and try on a better day.If it fails on the third attempt, leave well alone, otherwise it will cause untold stress.Try to do something new, instead.This always stuck in my memory and has helped me to move on when hobbies fail.However we all know that moving on is not always easy or stress free.While I was working I also gave up driving, after ending up driving off the road one day.Nothing was damaged, but I had no idea what had happened, but I realised that my brain was no longer in control.A few years later when I was on rivastigmine, I went back to driving, because I felt safer and more in control than many of the drivers on the roads. But this has not stopped completely because of eyesight problems which are terrible on some daysI know that I have had eye tests where nothing was found, so it's all down to the brain not getting the right signals from the eyes. But I could not live with the thought of killing someone because I was unsafe to drive, so to me this time it's far better to stop altogether until my eyes are sorted out.But if it comes to it, then my driving days are gone and that's it.I can always get the bus, yes it's slower, but at least someone else is driving.If like my you struggle typing on your computer at times, try to use voice activated software, it's amazing.",

But sadly those days are few and far between.I know that I have brain shrinkage because it was picked up in an MRI scan, buts that's as much as I know.So I am now just waiting to see if we can get any further forward with this diagnosis.My problem is that I forget things so easily, that when it comes to appointments, it all goes out of the window, and I struggle to remember.My wife has said that I am going to have to sit down and try to write things out, before I have my next appointment.This would help me and also the doctor I am seeing, but it's easier said than done at times, because unless I write it downfast, it's gone for ever",

The oral drug is commonly prescribed in the treatmentof mild to moderate Alzheimer's to help improve symptoms including thoseaffecting thinking and memory.Around 70% of people suffering from Parkinson's experience a fall atleast once a year, with more than a third (39%) saying they fall repeatedly,the report published in the Lancet Neurology journal said.Such falls often lead to broken bones.Over an eight-month period, scientists from the University of Bristolgave the drug to half of a group of 130 Parkinson's sufferers who had fallen inthe last year.Study participant Caroline Maxwell, from Northamptonshire, said thetreatment would give her the \"confidence\" to leave the house byherself.Mrs Maxwell, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's 13 years ago, said:\"A few years ago, I had a bad fall while carrying my sewing machine acrossthe room, leaving me in hospital for a week and really denting my confidence.\"By potentially finding a treatment that helps to prevent falls,I'd be able to get a replacement hip and have the confidence to go shopping onmy own, without having to constantly rely on the goodness of strangers to pickme up when I fell.\"Parkinson's is a disease which worsens over time, slowing the movementof those who suffer from it, as well as leading to tremors. There is currentlyno cure.Around one in every 500 of the population, or 127,000 people, sufferfrom the condition in the UK, according to the charity Parkinson's UK, whichhelped fund the study.Lead researcher and Parkinson's UK research fellow Dr Emily Hendersonsaid: \"With the degeneration of dopamine-producing nerve cells, peoplewith Parkinson's often have issues with unsteadiness when walking.\"As part of the condition, they also have lower levels ofacetylcholine, a chemical which helps us to concentrate - making it extremelydifficult to pay attention to walking.\"We already know that rivastigmine works to treat dementia bypreventing the breakdown of acetylcholine, however our study shows for thefirst time that it can also improve regularity of walking, speed, and balance. Thisis a real breakthrough in reducing the risk of falls for people withParkinson's.\"",

Current treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease focus on improving the symptoms, but few are able to slow the progression of the condition.Scientists at the Research Institute for the Care of Older People (RICE) are hoping that a new drug will act as a vaccine; targeting tau tangles in the brain to prevent their build-up potentially remove them altogether. The clinical trial will look at whether the drug is safe for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease to use. The researchers hope that it could potentially slow or halt the progression of the condition.Dr James Pickett, Head of Research at Alzheimer\u2019s Society said: \u201cSo far, most clinical trials have focused on amyloid protein, which can be responsible for brain cell death and some Alzheimer\u2019s disease symptoms, but this potential drug is targeted at tau protein tangles, that may be linked with memory loss.\u201cThe researchers are hoping that this could possibly be used as a vaccine, causing the body\u2019s immune system to attack the tau tangles. Although researchers are now looking at whether the vaccine is safe for people to use, it will be several years until we know if it will be able to improve the lives of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201cWith an ageing population and no new dementia drugs in over a decade, the need to find new treatments is more urgent than ever. We need more people to come forward to get involved with scientific studies.

This will be sorted out sometime after Christmas but at least I know that something is happening.I am leaving this blog on line so that earlier pages can still be looked at, but I would like to thank you all for your support over the years.I will also keep in touch once the final diagnosis comes through after Christmas",

ThenI have a review with my family doctor again, so he can see if the chest infection has cleared.I then return to see the chest consultant at Sunderland general hospital in ten days.My wife had a telephone call from the speech therapist at the same department to the specialist, and she confirmed that they thought I either had or was heading for COPD, when I saw them earlier in June.So perhaps I will get told how to change my life stile when I see him.I am feeling a lot better today, but I know that it's going to take time and things will have to change.

These people could change things, but do not seem to want to get involved, I guess because many are academics and have no real idea about normal people or the problems they face on a daily basis.We are now seeing this mass migration of refugees from Syria, so more money will be needed to feed these extra people in need., but I guess that the church will not get involved.I could not believe the fact that our church in our town, is now so ending \u00a311-000 on screens within this very old church, so that everyone can take part in the service.I confess that this leaves me wondering how we managed back in the 1967-70s, without all of this technology.Clergy back then were more thrifty with their funds, and only spent money on things which were desperately needed.I can understand why churches are now empty, because many people are becoming sick of the way this church is working.Many like myself have simply given up and will never return again.",

Health experts believe these findings could lead to updated medical advice on the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia in the NHS, which has profound implications for patients.Professor Smith toldCherwell, \u201cOur earlier work showed that just inadequate status (not frank deficiency) of certain B vitamins was asso- ciated with more rapid brain atrophy and that giving supplements of these vitamins could slow down the atrophy and also slow downmemory decline in people with mild cognitive impairment.\u201cThis was actually the first demonstration that the disease process early in Alzheimer\u2019s could be slowed down. What we have now shown is that this protective effect of B vitamins is only found in people who have a good omega-3 fatty acids status... what we need to do now is a trial in people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (an early stage of Alzheimer\u2019s disease) of a combination of B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids.\u201dDr Clare Walton, Research Communications Manager at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, however, stressed that more funding is needed to pro- vide conclusive results. She toldCherwell, \u201cThe research surrounding the role of B vitamins in influencing memory problems has so far been inconclusive. Larger studies are needed to fully understand the role that vitamins and fatty acids may play.\u201dThe announcement comes at the same time as a separate study, also conducted at Oxford University, revealed that less than 1% of funding allocated to dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s is spent on research.By contrast, over 10% of funding given to cancer is allocated specifically to research. This study has led to calls for increased funding for dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s research.",

It's not the first time that someone has driven at me, when I was half way across the pedestrian crossing.But the councillors here have no interest, because many of them never grew up in the area, and are yes men, in other words, you do not shake the boat as far as your political leaders are concerned.Those councillors who grow up in their towns and villiages, before becoming a local councillor, have a vastly different attitude towards the general publicDementia friendly towns need to take on board, that being dementia friendly, is not just having the title, it takes a lot of hard work, and involves many things, and to get that far, it takes a lot of hard work behind the scenes, usually by volunteers and charitiesI recently wrote to Durham County Council about traffic speed, as I had done a presentation in county hall about living with dementia a few years ago.Yet they have since shown a total lack of interest in anything to do with this illness or any other neurological illness. It's been left to charities and the public to do the work, and force them to do the obvious things that we all take for granted.As I said before speed control needs to be part of this, simply because everyone with a neurological illness has a problem in judging traffic distances and speeds etc.So in my view its up to the towns themselves to force issues through, to make the places friendly to all, and not just to people with these illnesses. Because when a town is friendly, and traffic is controlled, etc things clip into place.In this day and age when services are being savagely butchered by councils and this government, it's nice to see towns and villages taking the strain and working for those who struggle with Illnesses like dementia and its says a lot for those involved,I find it to be a real pity, that the elderly and those with these illnesses, who have worked hard and paid their taxes for years, are seeing their local services being cut back, to the minimum.But I do think that it's the people in these towns and villiages who are fighting back and doing things their own way.I wish Barnard Castle the very best of luck and hope they achieve their dream of becoming a dementia friendly market town.",

There needs to be an 'anything else we suspect\u2019 question.\u201cBut we would never want to be in the game of it being my say-so that they lose their licence. Medical revocations must be done by the DVLA.\u201dHe said that a lack of public transport had left many dementia sufferers with no alternative but to keep driving.Police road accident reports did not typically provide an option to record ill health as a factor, he added.Though no figures are gathered for accidents in which dementia is a factor, Dr Holden estimates there could be several thousand annually.He said: \u201cThose in the front line know it\u2019s an issue, most of us can say anecdotally in a practice that\u2019s 8,000-10,000, it\u2019s probably five or six cases a year, but would you tolerate five or six gunmen marauding in a year? No you wouldn\u2019t.\u201cI\u2019ve got a duty to the patient that they don\u2019t put themselves in a position where they mow down a row of kids. Because if I don\u2019t tell them that, who will?\u201cYou know what the rate of increase of dementia is, you only need three or four dementia sufferers out on the road, would you like one out with a shotgun?\u201dAndrew White, the DVLA\u2019s medical adviser, said: \u201cLicensing rules must ensure we have the right balance between safety and people\u2019s personal mobility.\u201cWe have arrangements with doctors and the police for them to notify us quickly about diagnosed or suspected health problems and we investigate these urgently.\u201d Dementia sufferers must currently notify the DVLA of their diagnosis or face a \u00a31,000 fine. Drivers must also reaffirm their fitness to drive and apply for a new licence every three years after their 70th birthday.Dr Holden is calling for the BMA\u2019s independent board of science to review the issue.George McNamara, of the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said: \u201cScaremongering is not helpful in making rational decisions in this area. A dementia diagnosis is not in itself a reason to stop driving.\u201dI personally find this to be an insult, on those living with this illnessAfter reading this, I was left feeling a little staggered, because for years Doctors have sat back and left it to that patients, to inform the D.V..LA, rather than doing it themselvesI do wonder if this is another form of stigma, as I have seen a lot of elderly people driving, when they clearly should have stopped.Yet early onset could involve people well under the age of 65Are we more dangerous than these teenagers, who have no idea what the speed limit meansSome have never gone through the process that people with early onset dementia go through when they are honest enough to tell the authorities.This then involves getting permission from your doctors and consultants, and then having to reapply every year to get your licence backI do feel that here again we are victims of the illness, because when it comes to insurance whether for holiday of driving we have to pay extra, and that's for being honest enough to admit that you have the illness in the first place I have seem fairly elderly people driving a car with a caravan in tow, and some driving motor caravans, even though they were unstable on their legsDo the doctors tell the authorities when someone has a alcohol or drug problem, I don't think soSo let us hope that common sense is used here before things get out of handI admit that I thought mandatory retesting should be done every time someone has a serious medical problem or reaches a certain age, but nothing happensA motor cyclist has to go through a rigorous testing scheme to get a licence to ride a motor bike, yet car driver can pass a test, and then get behind the wheel of a high powered car.So yes the licence scheme needs to be reviewed but it must be done properly  ",

It raises hopes for a new blood test to predict risk up to 10 years before symptoms set inThe research is still at an early stage, but scientists hope that it might be developed into a test which flags up those who are at risk of developing dementia.There are currently no treatments available proven to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease - but doctors hope that identifying those most at risk could speed the search for new drugs that could delay or even prevent the devastating brain disease.Flagging those at risk would give patients and their families more time to prepare, they hope..The protein - called MAPKAPK5 - was, on average, lower in individuals whose cognitive ability declined over a ten-year period.But by using identical twins - who share 100 per cent of their genes - the scientists showed that the association between the protein and cognition was independent of age and genetics.We\u2019re very optimistic that our research has the potential to benefit the lives of those who don\u2019t currently have symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s, but are at risk of developing the diseaseDr Claire Steves, King\u2019s College LondonExperts have been trying for years to create a blood test for Alzheimer\u2019s - often referred to as the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of dementia research.Currently patients are only diagnosed with the disease when they start to lose their memory - and thousands are thought to be living without a diagnosis.Brain scans have been shown to display visible signs of the disease before the onset of symptoms - but they are expensive.Study author Dr Steven Kiddle, of King\u2019s College London, said: \u2018Although we are still searching for an effective treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, what we do know is that prevention of the disease is likely to be more effective than trying to reverse it.\u2018The next step will be to replicate our finding in an independent study, and to confirm whether or not it is specific for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as this could lead to the development of a reliable blood test which would help clinicians identify suitable people for prevention trials.\u2019Dr Claire Steves, senior lecturer in twin research at King\u2019s College London, added: \u2018We\u2019re very optimistic that our research has the potential to benefit the lives of those who don\u2019t currently have symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s, but are at risk of developing the disease.\u2019There are currently no treatments available proven to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease - but doctors hope that identifying those most at risk could speed the search for new drugs that could delay or prevent the diseaseCharities last night welcomed the findings, which were funded by the Medical Research Council and published in the journal Translational Psychiatry.Dr Eric Karran, of Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \u2018Searching for reliable markers of disease in the blood is a tricky task, as protein levels can be influenced by so many factors that differ between individuals.\u2018Twin studies present a unique insight into the biology of complex diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, as they control for age and most genetic effects.\u2018This study associated blood levels of protein called MAPKAPK5 with cognitive decline over a ten year period, but it will be necessary to investigate more about a possible mechanism linking this protein to changes in memory and thinking.\u2018Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s will be essential for the development of new treatments, allowing clinical trials to take place involving the right people at the right time, when those treatments are most likely to be effective.\u2019",

This caused so many bad headaches, that I stopped wearing them.It felt as if one eye was straining to look through a jam jar bottom, and after a while I simply gave up.Every time I went to the hospital I saw a different person with different ideas, so there was no way that this could be sorted out properly.I later found out that it was the brain causing the problems and not the eyes.It's the brain failing to pick up the correct signals from the eyes, or its getting the information all wrong.So why is it that opticians say they know all about dementia etc, but do not recognise the problems caused by the brain,The problem is that many eye problems are intermittent, so as far as these people are concerned, if it's not there in the day of your appointment, your problem does not exist, or its your imagination playing tricksHow many people like me have these same problems, or have problems judging distances or traffic speed.People also miss a door way and walk into the door or frame because of these signals being picked up properlyI have walked off the pavement at times because I misjudged the kerb,So to me we need to have more research into this complex problem, because the brain is a very complex part of the bodyBut to do this research properly the research people need to involve those with a neurological illness and not simply ignorethe fact that we know what our problems are.So let us hope that before long, someone gets some research projects going looking into our problems",

Could they then go on to think that all of these people are still alive, even though they could have died many years ago.They could also cause upset, because these photographs may trigger an unhappy experience, which no one else knows about.I know from personal experience that old photographs can cause the imagination to go into overdrive, trying to remember who was there, where they lived, their ages, their families etc.So is this a good idea or a bad one, I suppose it all depends on the individuals, because we are all so very different.",

Itcan start with a multitude of different changes such as altered behaviour,speech and language difficulties, changes in mood or motivation levels, balanceand coordination difficulties, even before any memory issues arise.Frequently, problemsare first recognised at the effected person's place of work. People whopreviously had been high functioning may become disorganised, start to missmeetings or appointments, and fail to manage their work load. It is felt theydo not \"seem themselves\" but it is hard to pinpoint exactly what haschanged.In retrospect, familyand friends frequently say they can go back several years to when they firstnoticed changes occurring once a diagnosis has been made.There's no doubt thatbeing told you have a form of dementia can be distressing, but I also speak topeople who are relieved they finally have a diagnosis.Dementia is alife-limiting and challenging illness but my colleagues and my colleagues and Itry to focus on the positives encouraging people to continue to live theirlives while also supporting them to make plans for the future.Very much part of ourrole is to encourage people diagnosed with dementia and their family members toarrange lasting power of attorney, not just for a person's financial affairsbut also for health and welfare decisions.We also help withapplication for statutory benefits, support or companionship at home whileanother family member is working, and enjoyable activities to keep peopleoccupied.This is in additionto monitoring the effected person's presentation, their response to anyprescribed medication and other changes that may be causing concern.Help is available,and if you are concerned about a relative or a friend \u2013 regardless of their age- please support them to visit their GP.Carolyn Fuller is aspecialist mental health nurse for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHSFoundation Trust's Young People with Dementia Team.",

You may also go on to live without getting either of these illnesses.To label someone with this illness and not to look any further seems to me to be very odd, when we consider that there are many neurological illnesses where these symptoms appear.I do think many doctors treat people with contempt when it comes to this illness. They just say, You have Mild Cognitive Impairment, but never look any further to explore the causes of it.It has been stated that many professionals are simply splitting hairs, like gardeners deciding whether a rose is a true hybrid or not.The problem is that it's the patients who are coming off the worst because they are hung out to dry, because some of the doctors simply do not understand this illness in the first place.I have heard many people being diagnosed as just being depressed, when in fact they had dementia, or some other neurological illness, but the doctors had no intention of looking to see why you were \"depressed\".This could in many cases be due to the fact that you are losing control over your lives, or maybe your job, but these doctors simply cannot see the obvious.I have lost my job as an Engineer, simply because I totally forgot how to do it, and was then classed as unsafe to do it.I was employed to oversee all contractors and maintenance staff, but my main role was Electrical Maintenance and estimating. I used to run two large budgets, yet I ended up counting on my fingers, something I found to be very frightening, fine these days it's gone, and my wife deals with money and paying the bills etc.My wife talks of the time when I retired the College Chapel, yet this has all gone, so what on earth happened. These days I cannot fit a 13amp plug without getting my son to check that its been done properly, all my experience has gone down the plug hole.So this makes mild cognitive impairment, something to be highlighted, because when things go wrong like this, it's a major problem and something which should not be taken lightly.So let us hope that someone picks up the mantle in the future, and raises the profile of those diagnosed as having this illness, otherwise they risk being forgotten about in the future.Final blogI have decide to stop writing on this blog because it is about Living with Lewy Body Dementia.I will leave this running, but may well Start a new blog about Mild Cognitive Impairment and memory problems.

        "content": "When I was diagnosed as having Lewy body dementia in Durham, my consultant told me to set up a routine.This would get me through the day without the permanent support of others like my wife, because she like other carers, have enough problems to deal with on a daily basis, without watching over our every moveItwas also recognised that I did struggle at times, with short term memory problems.Since my diagnosis has been changed to mild cognitive impairment, I am still the same person with the same problems including memory.It's not easy getting used to this re-diagnosis, partly because, I am still under a consultant to see if it's all Parkinson related. But I have to be positive, while this is going on, because as I said before, my problems are still the same, and my family are relying on me to keep fighting this illness.I still use my routines as I did before, although these days I am starting to forget to take my medication morethan I did earlier, but that's life.I know that whenthis diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment is finalised, I will be taken off my Exelon medication as it's not recommended for this illnessHowever It's all well and good telling people to set up routines, but when you have memory problems, it only takes a little thing to distract you and your routine goes out of the window.It's not the first time that I have got started on my daily routine, when the telephone or door bell rang, or someone spoke, and everything went out of the window.Some days you can pick up where you were, but in other days, it's all gone.I was once stopped when I was shaving, and only realised later in the day, that I had shaved one side of my face, while the other side was left unshaved.This was very embarrassing, because my wife and I only realised when we were shopping, by which time I could not wait to get home again.On other days I have forgotten to take my mediation, which is usually on a table beside me.This medication is always sorted out by my wife on a weekly basis, but itonly takes a slight distraction and it's all gone hay wire.I had to stop cooking when I burnt two pans, by putting something on the cooker, only to forget that I had done it in the first place.When you smell something burning, or the smoke detector goes off, you realise that something is wrong, but by this stage it's too late.So now my cooking is done in the microwave.So no matter whether you have dementia or mild cognitive impairment, it still effects the memory, and once that plays up, you really do have problems.It's not the first time I have got out of my chair, to walk to the computer, only to forget what I was going to do.I use voice activated software on my computer and iPad these days, so that I do not forget what I am trying to write.At least with this, I just speak and let the computer write it all down. Ino longer have to look down at the keyboard and back up to the screen, until it's all finished and ready for corrections to be done.So it's a case of using any assistive technology available, as and when you can, as it will help you get through the day.I no longer give people directions these days, because I always say turn left when I mean right. This is because my co ordination has gone.On top of this I still have a letter telling me that I have brain shrinkage, which according to our family doctor is not linked to normal ageing.But life has to go on, and now I need to decide what to do with things this blog in the future.I guess I will put the blog on the back burner until this is all sorted out.",

        "content": "Like many I have struggled to understand what Mild Cognitive Impairment is, and how it differs from a dementia.The other day I found a document on the Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS, website, and found that this explained things a lot easier than anything else had in the past three months.I suppose that like many other people I wondered if Mild Cognitive Impairment was just a cop out.But having read this, it explains many of my problems, apart from things like my graphic nightmares.This makes me wonder just how many people living with dementia, will have their diagnosis reversed at some later stage.Mild Cognitive ImpairmentIntroductionThe aim of this leaflet is to provide you with information about Mild Cognitive Impairment.If you are not sure about anything please ask a member of staffWhat is Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI?)If you are told that you have Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), this means that your mental abilities (cognition) are not as good as they used to be.This usually refers to problems affecting memory, but involve a change in problem solving, thinking, attention, concentration, language or visual ability.MCI is more than just normal forgetting, and means a difficulty, that is greater than it would be expected for normal ageing.MCI is not the same as DementiaPeople with MCI can be at risk of developing dementia in the future, but many do not develop more problems and a small number can recoverWhat causes MCI? There are many different reasons why people develop MCIOften it can be difficult to identify the underlying cause. Your doctor may or may not be able to say what the underlying cause of your difficulties isWhat difficulties can be expected?The difficulties that those with MCI experience can vary and depend on what part of your cognition is affected.The cognitive assessment that you completed, will have helped highlight the strengths and weaknesses in your ability.Difficulties seen in MCI can include:-MemoryMisplacing itemsDifficulty retaining information, such as recalling phone messages or shopping listsForgetting what you have done recently and events you have attendedForgetting what you are planning to do in the future, such as remembering appointments and datesForgetting what you went into a room to collect or doRecalling the names of people or things.Difficulty concentrating on tasksLosing track of what you wanted to say in a conversationLanguageWord finding difficulties - finding the right word you want to say in a conversationDifficulty in describing objects or situationsBeing less fluent in conversations with othersProblem solvingDifficulty planning and problem solving in relation to carrying out tasks, such as cooking, household chores, DIY tasks.Difficulty adapting to changes in routineA change in judgement, personality or behaviourVisualExperiencing more difficulty navigating and recalling directionsDifficulty judging distancesDifficulty coordinating tasks such as dressingOther symptomsLow moodIncreased feelings of irritability or having more difficulty coping with stressApathy - loss of enthusiasm for previously enjoyed activitiesFeelings can include sadness, anger, worry, or frustrationWhat can I do to help memory/cognitive difficulties? There are many different coping strategies that can make life easier, if you have noticed a change in memoryMaking changes to your environmentYou can adapt your environment to help with memory difficulties, so that you do not need to rely on your memory as muchUse a notebook, calender or diary, to help you remember thingsPut a notebook by the telephone to note down and phone calls and messagesWrite important dates and appointments on a calenderDecide on a special place to keep items such as keys, or glasses. Make sure you put them back in the same place after using them, so you always know where to find themPut information on a notice boardUse a pill box or weekly dispenser for tablets. These can be requested free of charge via your DoctorSetting up a routine Another way to make life easier is to set up a routine. This can reduce any memory problems as you get used to expect, e.g. taking night time medication straight after cleaning teeth, or doing the weekly shopping on a TuesdayUsing memory aidsMemory aids can be important. These can take over some tasks that your memory does, and also reduce the number of things that you have to remember, which helps your memory work better.All memory aids work best if you can make them part of your routineUsing a diary - to record what you do on a daily basis and keep track of your appointmentsNotebook - to write down information that you want to rememberCalender - displayed in a prominent place can be a good way to note future appointments and social events. It is important to check this each day.Making lists of what to do to stop doing - e.g. shopping listsNotice board or wipe dry board - this is useful for leaving messages for family members and writing reminders to yourself. You could also record important phone numbers that you need to remember.Sticky backed notes - these can be left in places around the home to remind you to do things.Alarm clocks - timers, mobile phones - can be used as a prompt for activities such as taking food out of the ovenA tape recorder or Dictaphone - this is useful to record anything you want to remember.Getting a newspaper daily - this can be a good prompt for the dateMaintaining well beingIt is important to reduce any stress, anxiety or low mood as much as possible.These difficulties have a negative impact on memory and concentration and can worsen memory problemsContinue to lead an active life and maintain all interests and activities that you enjoy - try not to stop any interestsIf you notice that you are becoming low in mood or anxious, talk to close friends about your feelingsIt can also be helpful to tell family and friends, about what difficulties you are experiencing and how they can support you, such as providing prompts and help with memory.Try not to become concerned or embarrassed if you forget something.If you have difficulty finding the right word or piece of information, try not to worry about this or try too hard to rememberOnce you stop trying it will come back to youTry to do one task at a time, as tackling too many things at once can become confusingTake your time - there is no need to hurryBreak up tasks into small steps, to make them more manageableWill my difficulties get any better?For a few people with MCI, difficulties can get better if identified problems are due to physical health problems, or anxiety/ stress or low mood, and there is a subsequent improvement in well beingBut for the majority of people with MCI, it is likely that problems will not ever get better.However, problems might not get any worse either.Some people with MCI can later experience a progression of their problems which might subsequently lead to a diagnosis of dementia. Of those only 10-15% per year develop dementia.Can memory medications be used in MCI?A number of studies completed have shown that using memory drugs for the treatment of MCI do not improve memory and will not prevent difficulties from getting worse.The side effects are more pronounced when used in MCI and include higher rates of nausea, diarrhoea and leg cramps.Therefore the memory drugs are not used in MCI.How can someone have the best chance of avoiding dementia in the future?Research has suggested that life style can affect a person\u2019s risk of developing dementia.There are steps that can be taken to reduce risk:-Take regular exercise such as walking or swimmingMaintain the range of interests and activities that you previously enjoyed, such as socialising, with friendsKeep the mind active - doing crossword puzzles or word searches - as long as these are activities that you enjoyLook after your health - stop smoking, refrain from exceeding the recommended amounts of alcohol, and avoid eating too many fatty foodsWhat would be the signs that my problems are getting worseIn the future, should you feel that your memory/ cognitive difficulties are getting worse, please discuss this with your doctor, who may re-refer you to the service.Possible signs of difficulties getting worse are:-Cognitive problems getting significantly worse and occurring more often.It can also be helpful to check whether the family or close friends have noticed any changesNoticing difficulties occurring in other areas of ability such as attention/concentration, problem solving, language or visual ability.Noticing a change in your ability in everyday life, to do tasks such as cooking, shopping, household choresIt is also worth considering how you have generally been feeling lately as increased stress, low mood, or an experience of loss can result in a temporary worsening of memoryMCI and drivingIf driving is not affected then the DVLA (Driving and Vehicle Licensing Authority) does not need to be notified.However for some people with MCI, the cognitive difficulties being experienced can impact on the driving ability.This might come to light through specific difficulties being identified from cognitive assessments, such as visual problem solving difficulties, or concern being raised about the possible change in the driving ability.In these instances the DVLA should be notified to allow enquiries to take placeYou will be advised as to whether you need to notify the DVLA.Notifying the DVLA does not mean that you will be automatically stopped from driving, instead enquiries will be made to reach a decision around driving abilityIn some cases a driving assessment may be required",

But it is now recognised that if you were diagnosed 15 20 years ago and have not deteriorated, as expected, you no longer have that illness, but have mild cognitive impairment.This causes many problems because some people have the scan results to prove, that their brains have shrunk to the stage that there can be no other diagnosis available.In my own case we have letters to prove that my brain has shrunk, more than it should have done for my ageBut this leaves some doctors arguing about the true diagnosis you should be given.This is why these days you are initially given the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment to start with, and then if you deteriorate you are told you have one firm of dementia or another.I personally do not understand this because there are quite a few well known people around the world who have had dementia for up to or over 20 years, and are still going well.I understood that this was because they remained active and never stopped, but a consultant I came across recently rubbished this.In there words if you have not deteriorated within 5-10 years,you never had it in the first place?One doctor told me recently that this is down to specialists splitting hairs, about the definition of dementia, the same as gardeners argue about a true type of Rose?But this does raise concerns, because many like myself lost their jobs etc, after being given a diagnosis of Lewy body dementia etc, and are now being re diagnosed as having MCI.The symptoms have not changed, the problems are the same, just the title has changed.This then leads to other knock on problems with things like the driving licence, holiday insurance, etc as people rightly want to know why the diagnosis has changed, and why you are taken off the medication etc.In my own case the DVLA have dragged out returning my driving licence, which should have been replace on January 5th of this year, and 20 weeks later I am still none the wiser.It also leads me to winder what happens if and when the medication is stopped, and you deteriorate faster than before. There is no going back again.Perhaps one day things will be a lot clearer for all including the patient to understand.",

I know after I was diagnosed, I did not want to be sitting around the house.\u201cI volunteer for a housing group and I also perform my songs in different places. It\u2019s important to keep busy.\u201dTwo dementia support workers have been recruited in the North East to help develop a series of activities across a large part of the region.The primary activity in the service will be table tennis as research shows the sport is particularly beneficial for people with dementia.The game\u2019s mechanics uniquely activates a number of areas of the brain at the same time resulting in an increased state of cognitive awareness in the player.Hannah Woodworth, Dementia support Worker for the Alzheimers Society and volunteer Margaret George, playing ping pong in Eldon Square, Newcastle as part of Games for the BrainHannah Woodworth, a dementia support worker in Newcastle andNorth Tyneside, said: \u201cWe understand that people have varying levels of fitness and abilities and therefore the service will be tailored to meet the needs of people at all stages of their dementia journey.\u201cWe aim to provide a space for people with dementia to come and enjoy themselves, helping them engage in new activities and old hobbies.\u201dClaire White, a worker inCounty Durham, added: \u201cThis is a really excellent service that will enable people affected by dementia to carry on their hobbies or to take up new ones in their community as they choose.\u201cIn the first year we will be targeting specific areas within County Durham, we plan to start in Bishop Auckland with a table tennis group in partnership with Bishop Auckland Table tennis club.\u201dThe service aims to improve cognition, increase feelings of wellbeing and to reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness so that people with dementia feel supported to participate in enjoyable and stimulating activities.",

They all wear a badge but never take things any further, to me they are simply using illnesses like dementia to hide their other problems.Wereally do need the government to force the NHS into supporting Admiral Nurses and base them in the local areas. It's simply not good enough, at present.Everyone has paid over the years towards the National Health Service, and therefore we should all be treated as equals.Far too much money is thrown away on management which is over rated, and in many cases, unnecessary. If you get cancer you are supported by Macmillan nurses from the start, and I really do think we should be seeing Admiral nurses when a person gets dementia.The NHS can afford this service if they balanced their books properly, but it's up to the large dementia Charities to get up and fight for these nurses, not sit back and let others do their workMoney is wasted in the NHS on people like those who get drunk every weekend, rather than sending them somewhere else to get them off the habit.If that treatment fails they should take the hard approach, and make them pay for treatment, because like it or not, it's self inflicted, unlike dementiaServices are being stretched to the limit by this alcohol problem in the UK, and it's time it was stopped.When we look at it the carers In this country, they save the Government and NHS billions each year, yet they are untrained, get little or no support, nor do they get any thanks from the government.Many people with dementia want to stay at home where they will be cared for properly, but to do this, we need the backup and support of good quality nursing staff, and it's here that the admiral nurses come in.They are qualified to support not just the person with the illness, but also the carer.It's simply not good enough to rely on caring organisations, because the specialist treatment and service does not exist.So perhaps it's time that the NHS was made to provide the services that people need rather than spending billions on the drunkards every weekendHaving been in an accident and emergency department with my wife one weekend, I was horrified at the number of drunkards, all dishing out abuse towards everyone else, yet if a person with dementia gets agitated we are branded as angry and abusive towards the staff.It seems to me there is a double standards here and we come off the worst.So perhaps it's time for those in charge of the NHS to take notice and change things for the best.It's time to stand up and fight for Admiral Nurses, so that those with dementia are given the specialist care they deserve. We all deserve this, as do our carers. Our carers are our angels, but they too need support and help, so it's up to us all to fight for this service now.",

But I was in my elementI will point out that music I like during the day, does not work at night if I cannot sleep, as a change of pitch can cause problems,So my iPod has different music on it, especially for night time.My politics have also changed, but that is a subject I will not go into for safety reasons, not that I have become a communist or anything like that, but this was a shock all the same.So what causes these changes when you are diagnosed as having one form of dementia or another.I know now that changes to eyesight, senses and hearing are caused by the brain not picking up the signals as they used to do, so is this the same with foodstuffs.Perhaps that's what causes these changes, and perhaps someone out there can explain it, because I have many friends living with dementia, who have experienced the same problems, yet none of us know why things change like this.",

I cannot think of anything more taxing that working on Electrical Installations, working from complex drawings, and rewiring old buildings.It strikes me that this story implies the rest of us did less menial jobs which were boring and did not stretch us enough Having a challenging job could prevent dementia: It helps keep brain active and slows the rate of decline in memory and thinking, study saysStudy was carried out by researchers at the University of Leipzig Found those with challenging jobs had half the rate of decline in memoryThose at less risk of dementia were doctors, lawyers, architects and teachersPeople with demanding jobs may be protected against dementia, say researchers.Those with challenging work had half the rate of decline in memory and thinking in later life compared to those in mentally undemanding work.Lead researcher Dr Francisca Then at the University of Leipzig said \u2018Our study is important because it suggests that the type of work you do throughout your career may have even more significance on your brain health than your education does.\u2018Challenges at work may indeed be a positive element, if they build up a person\u2019s mental reserve in the long-term.\u2019Doctors have long held that keeping your brain active could be the best insurance against developing Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia.Workers doing more complex jobs including doctors, lawyers, architects and teachers were found to be less at risk of dementia in later life, according to a study last year from Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh.Another international study found speaking a second language may delay dementia by five years.Researchers have debated whether a more stimulating environment may build up a person\u2019s \u2018cognitive reserve\u2019, acting as a buffer allowing the brain to function in spite of damage, or whether people with higher thinking skills tend to go into more challenging occupations.The latest study, in the journal Neurology involved 1,054 people over the age of 75 who were quizzed about their work history and their tasks were divided into three groups - executive, verbal and fluid.Executive tasks included scheduling work and activities, developing strategies and resolving conflicts.Examples of verbal tasks were evaluating and interpreting information while fluid tasks were those which included selective attention and analysing data.The group was given tests that measured their memory and thinking abilities every one-and-a-half years for eight years.Memory and thinking abilities were examined through a clinical test, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), in which low or declining scores are used to help diagnose dementia.Results found those whose careers included the highest level of all three types of tasks scored more on the thinking and memory tests over people with the lowest level.People with the highest level of all three types of tasks also had the slowest rate of cognitive decline and over eight years.Their rate of decline was half the rate of participants with a low level of mentally demanding work tasks.Among the three types of work tasks, high levels of executive and verbal tasks were significantly associated with slower rates of memory and thinking decline.People with a high level of executive tasks scored two MMSE points higher on memory and thinking tests at the beginning of the study and five MMSE points higher after eight years in the study compared to those who had a low level of these tasks.Those with a high level of verbal tasks declined an average two MMSE points less than used to a low level.In Britain, around 830,000 people have dementia, with most suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s.Previous research has found regular exercise can cut the risk of developing dementia, while other studies suggest keeping the brain active by doing crosswords, playing cards and computer work.",

A total of 76.1 per cent said \u2018no\u2019, while 9.4 per cent were unsure.One GP described it as a \u2018cause of unnecessary anxiety for patients\u2019 and \u2018poorly thought through\u2019.He also warned that the screening methods were \u2018poorly sensitive\u2019, raising the risk of wrong diagnosis.Another doctor said: \u2018This is likely to lead to overdiagnosis which in itself carries a risk for patients.\u2019One said the \u2018money attached\u2026 incentivises GPs to make the diagnosis, a real conflict of interests\u2019. Another said it was a \u2018waste of everyone\u2019s time\u2019, while one doctor said \u2018it has not improved care\u2019.There is no cure for dementia. An estimated 850,000 adults in Britain have the illness and officials now believe that two thirds have had a formal diagnosis. The scheme has now been dropped.Dr Martin Brunet, a GP in Guildford, Surrey, who campaigned against the initiative, said the rise in diagnosed cases \u2018raised questions\u2019 about whether patients had been misdiagnosed.NHS England insisted it was only ever planned to be a temporary measure. Professor Alistair Burns, of NHS England, said: \u2018Awareness of dementia is at its highest and we believe timely diagnosis of dementia allows people to access the emotional, practical and financial support that brings.\u2018We want it to be normal to talk about memory problems and to encourage people to come forward for an assessment if they or their families have concerns.\u2019R",

Abuse of people with dementia is now worse than ever before, yet he will not go down the route of passing laws to make this against the law.We will just have to wait and see what happens in the future, but like many others I am not holding my breath, because I never trusted any leader who looks down his nose when talking to other people.",

One at North Durham Hospital and one in Chester le Street, as the first had shown a shadow on it.We got rather a shock to hear him say, that he could not see any records of them, so he could not tell what they had shown.So why had we been sent there when they do not have access to my recent records and X-rays?After looking through my other records that were on his desk, he asked about the Lewy Body Dementia.Then said that as Lewy Body Dementia is linked to Parkinson's, he would need to make changes to how the antibiotics are prescribed, when I receive them.This will happen when it all kicks off around October /November time, until April /May when it stops, due to better weather. That is unless I get an infection any other time.He said that chest infections were quite common in people with Parkinson's, so he had a choice of putting me on long term antibiotics, or just organising the new prescription next time it was needed.I told him that I had been on them for three months, and ended up feeling much worse, so Ihad refused to take anymore.He agreed with this and said it was because the antibiotics do extra damage over time and this causes problems with the immune system,So it would be better to change the dose, as well as giving me something else at the same time to ensure my throat is kept clear.This is because we lose control over our muscles in places like our throats, so this medication would allow the throat to remain fairly clearHe thinks it will also prevent the distressing cough on a morning and during the night.I had also noticed problems at times when drinking, or eating certain foods, which apparently is also common in this illnessI am also being sent to see a speech therapist, who can give me ideas for keeping my throat clear, and will also help with my speech, as I have now got an occasional stammer.After this we left and got the bus home, to mull over everything the consultant had said.I confess that I missed quite a lot of what was said, but my wife went over everything again until I understood it.I suppose we had learnt quite a lot in that two hours, because most if it was related to my illness, but how was it that we did not know anything about it, surely this is all common knowledge where the professionals are concerned.I am seeing a Parkinson's consultant next week about my balance issues, so perhaps it will all be explained a little better then.",

We were both taken back, because we had never seen her before, but somehow she knew who we were.It was a lovely thought, that someone was going out of their way to buy us a tea or coffee, when we did not know who she was at the time.We waited outside the lecture theatre until the lecturer arrived, and then my wife then spoke explained what had happened.I am not sure who got the biggest surprise, but the lecturer guessed who the person was, and as we walked into the room, she thanked the young lady for being so nice.This goes to prove that it's been a real honour to work with these graduate nurses, and we both said that everyone we met, has been so lovely and polite.There were lots of people writing notes all of the way through the presentation, and they all seemed genuinely interested in the subject.So it was a lovely morning, and it made me proud to speak to these students and proud to be part of this university.It's lovely also to see how the Nurse training in Universities like Northumbria, and Teeside are helping to change the way staff think and treat patients in hospitals etc, and this has to be a good thing for the future.",

Surely there is something wrong these days, when someone like a Neurologist who has a thorough training in the brain, has their ideas over ruled by someone who has not specialised in brain disease.It also concerns me that this is done without proper care, and very little explanation if any at all.These people still have the same symptoms and problems, but it sounds by all accounts, as if they were re diagnosed simply because they did not deteriorate as the text books say they should.By most accounts, they were simply told that they did not have any form of dementia, and should be pleased. To me that is a total insult to those who have been given the diagnosis, and have learnt to change their lives and move on.If someone disagrees with a diagnosis, surely they should ensure that the patient is then sent back to see a Neurologist, where they can be given a full reason for the change in the diagnosis.Not simply being told, that they do not have the illness and be left to cope with it on their ownMany of these people have been on medication like Exelon, and have tried their best to remain active, so this must explain something.No one is put on Exelon or any other medication unless they have problems like dementia or Parkinson's in the first place. One clinical psychologist told me a while ago, that most if this is down to the fact that the patients simply did not sound like text book cases, as they did not deteriorate as fast as they should, andhospitals do not want people on their lists for too long these days.So is this all down to cutting costs and nothing to do with medicine, I do wonderPerhaps if there is a clinician out there they may be able to explain this to all those who are struggling with this problem, and no longer know what their illness is any more",

However this has to be difficult if the person lost their job etc, through having been diagnosed as having any form of dementia.Yet as my family doctor said, if we were all the same, how is it that some people have been diagnosed as having a type of dementia for up to 15-20 years and are still going. Many of these people have scans to prove that their brain has shrunk etc.It's because they simply got diagnosed earlier and did not sit back. But moved on and had an active life.This is rather confusing and In some cases distressing, because how many others are in the same boat, not knowing anymore about what they have been diagnosed with, especially if you lost things like your job, because you were unable or unsafe to do it.This also causes the person to lose confidence, and perhaps become depressed, all caused by possible ,mis diagnosis or clinicians who are too eager to give a name to an illness in the first place.This also causes people to lose confidence in the National Health Service, which is very understandable.As my doctor said thereis defiantly something wrong because my brain has shrunk, and because I lost my job as a College Engineer, and cannot remember how to do electrical work, estimates and budgets anymore.To me this helps me to understand why our National Health Services are in such a mess these days.I heard that many people are going through a similar process, of being diagnosed a few years ago, and then having their diagnosis changed by the specialist, so something must be going on within the National Health Service in. The UKI also understand now that some hospitals do not want you on their books, if you have been diagnosed over ten years.Which is why you are re- diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment, because you have not deteriorated fast enough, but I guess that's life, although it feels as if we may have been living a very bad dream which no one can answer.It's a bit like being diagnosed as having cancer, only to have someone come back years later to say, that you never had it in the first place.No one should be labeled as having an illness unless there is proof.This illness is difficult to diagnose as there are over 120 variations of dementia, so no matter what happens, they reckon that no two people with any form of dementia can have the same symptoms or problems, we are all individualsThis also leaves me wondering whether some of these so called wrongly diagnosed people, will go on on and sue the doctors who diagnosed them in the first place, it's becoming such a mine field.So much for the Prime Minister saying that diagnosis of dementia should be done in 6 weeks, I do wonder if he us simply using dementia as a way of deflecting people from the problems he has caused within the National Health Service.",

Here's how tomake lifeeasierWHAT TOEXPECTThe early stages ofthe disease bring changes that may be so subtle that some friends andacquaintances are unaware that there is anything wrong - and this stage cancontinue for many years.But as the diseaseprogresses and more damage is done to the brain, symptoms become morepronounced: difficulties with communication become more intense and issues suchas getting dressed or managing day-to-day affairs become more problematic.This marks thebeginning of the middle stage, the longest stage, which can last for severalyears. It's when the condition becomes more challenging and extra help may beneeded.However, there willbe good days as well as bad. The following can help . . .ShareIn the early stagesof dementia, it's the short-term memory that's most affected, making it harderfor patients to keep track of the day, or even what time of day it is.I've found thatsticking to a routine helps keep someone with dementia better orientated, andgets their body clock into a rhythm.In the early stages,aim to establish fixed times of day for the following - it may help to writethis on a board that's kept next to a calendar (cross it off to show what dayit is) and a clock, so that they know what to expect when.\u00b7Bed and getting-up times.\u00b7When to take medication.\u00b7Meal times.\u00b7Shopping days.\u00b7Leisure time such as TV, radio or social times.In the middle stagesof dementia, routines may still be useful but patients can be more prone tomood changes, so be flexible. Encourage but don't coerce.3Often people with dementia may displaymore symptoms and anxiety as the light starts to fadeWHEN BEHAVIOURCHANGESThe middle stage ofdementia inevitably heralds changes in behaviour. This can be one of thetoughest things to cope with, for at times it may seem as if the person youknow and love has gone. The following are common:ClinginessThis can be verydraining as some people with dementia do not like to let their carer out oftheir sight. Clinginess is the return of a psychological reflex from ourtoddler years - a toddler will cry when their mother moves away or when astranger approaches.As the dementiaprogresses, the loss of nerve cells in the brain allows old reflexes that werereplaced in adulthood by more complex brain pathways to resurface.What to do: The bestway to deal with it is by diluting contact - try introducing other regularcarers as soon as the person being cared for starts to display any clingybehaviour. The clinging behaviour may now apply to many people, not just one.WanderingAround 60 per cent ofthose with dementia wander - pacing around the house or outside of the home -and the problem is they can get lost, as the damage to the hippocampus part ofthe brain means they lose their sense of orientation.What to do: If theytell you they're going out don't argue but speak calmly and tell them theydon't need to as they are 'staying here' tonight.Avoid busy placessuch as shopping centres. People with dementia may find these disorientatingand when they get home this disorientation can continue and induce wandering sothey may feel the urge to leave the house.Wandering about thehouse at night can arise from a need to go to the loo. Ensure they don't havetoo much fluid before bed and install night-lights to help prevent falls.Painting the walls and doors a matching colour makes it less likely that theperson with dementia will find their way out.You could alsoconsider moving the lock higher up the door to a less familiar place.You may want toconsider installing movement sensors to alert you to potential problems.Two-thirds of those with Alzheimer'sexperience 'sundowning', which possibly happens due to a disruption to brainchemicals affecting the body clockAnxietyWorrying for noreason or displaying physical symptoms such as palpitations are signs that thedementia patient may be suffering with anxiety.What to do: Try toidentify what's causing it - have there been more people round than normal, orhave they had too much caffeine? Many of the triggers may be unavoidable, butit can help to keep their surroundings as comfortable and relaxing as possible.Put pictures andfamiliar possessions around them. Pleasant smells such as flowers, bakingaromas and soap may trigger memories that help distract them from their anxiousfeelings.Playing music canalso be calming. Talking to them can distract them, too. But never talk down tothem or use childish language as this could make them angry.Anger and aggressionIt can be confusingwhen someone who was once so patient and tolerant becomes prone to tempertantrums.What to do: It'simportant to consider any physical reasons that might be making them this way.Pain is a commoncause of anger in those with dementia, as are urinary or chest infections, astroke, or even something as simple as not having had enough sleep.If you suspect any ofthese is possible, then speak to a doctor.Speak to the personwith dementia reassuringly, in a calm manner. Use music or a calming activitysuch as massaging or stroking their hand or brushing their hair to distractthem.If, however, theyseem aggressive do not put yourself in danger. If necessary, move back and waitfor them to calm down.+3Keep the person busy at sundown and inthe early eveningSundowningOften people withdementia have good and bad days but also good and bad times during a given day- and often they may display more symptoms and anxiety as the light starts tofade, becoming confused, agitated, restless or showing repetitive behaviours.This pattern isreferred to as 'sundowning'.It's not clear whythis happens - it's possible it's to do with a disruption to brain chemicalsaffecting the body clock. Two-thirds of those with Alzheimer's diseaseexperience sundowning.It can occur at anystage of the condition, but tends to peak at the middle stage and lessen as thedisease progresses.What to do: Keep theperson busy at sundown and in the early evening. Avoid stimulants such ascoffee or alcohol at this time of day as this may make them more excitable. Arocking chair can help as it is soothing and relaxing. It may also help tointroduce more light into the room.LOOK THEM IN THEEYE WHEN YOU TALKWith dementia, theparts of the brain that normally deal with understanding, thought processing andlanguage deteriorate.The patient maystruggle with nuances and may lose their sense of humour; they may also getfrustrated and cross when they can't quickly bring to mind the words they need.Furthermore, they mayseem to get stuck in a loop and repeat the same question again and again.The followingstrategies can help tackle these issues:\u00b7Before you start talking always engage eye contact to help get theperson with dementia to focus on you. There can be a tendency for them to lookaway and this makes it harder for them to concentrate on the conversation.\u00b7\u00b7Be careful about asking questions they may be unable to process. Forexample, if they're upset don't ask what's wrong as they may not know, or areunable to put it into words. Instead, tell them: 'You seem to be upset; let'sthink how we can make you feel better.'\u00b7Finishing sentences for them can increase frustration. It's better toask if they'd like you to find words for them if they're having difficulty.\u00b7\u00b7Watch their body language as this can give you clues about how they arefeeling. For example, repetitive movements can mean they are anxious or scared,while withdrawing may mean they feel overwhelmed.\u00b7\u00b7If they're doing something obviously wrong, for example putting dishesin the washing machine or clothes in a food cupboard, don't ask them why orcastigate them - the reasoning side of their brain has been affected andpointing out their mistakes will only cause them embarrassment and frustration.\u00b7Better to say: 'Youseem to have put the crockery in the washing machine. Did you mean to put themin the dishwasher?'\u25a0 Dr Souter is aretired GP and fellow of the Royal College of General Practitioners.

I simply found that I could not work out how to do this safely. Looking back I guess most people would have put the tools down and changed hands, but when your brain does not work as it should you end up doing many things that would be classed as dangerous.I had to stop doing wood turning, because I simply forgot how to stop the machine and tried to grab the revolving block, which ended up damaging my fingers.After that my son took the lathe apart, under my wife's instructions and that stopped me using it.This machine had more emergency buttons on it than enough, for my own safety, but I forgot how to use them.I used to like swimming, but had to stop, because I found that when I moved my arms, my mouth was opening. So I was starting to swallow more water than I should. This was alarming, but it proved that something had gone drastically wrong in my way of processing information.Sometimes when I am walking I find that my stick gets in the way of my leg, and I am lucky if I don't trip.I sometimes completely miss the doorway and hit the door or the frame, ending up with bruises on one arm or another.Many tasks I used to do on a daily basis, have now been given up, because of co-ordination problemsAll of which makes me wonder just what is going on in the brain.The brain is a wonderful thing when you think about it, a bit like a computer, but when the information it's getting is wrong then things go wrong.This is all things I simply do not understand.",

Claire simply took overAt this time I was a University College Engineer, on call 24 hours a day for breakdowns. I was also doing and Electrical Engineering Course at home in my spare time, so sleep simply did not always happen.I worked on my electrical course from 3 till 6 am each morning then got the children ready for school, and did the packed lunches, although Claire took it upon herself, to take this over somewhere along the line, so for a 9 year old she was truly amazing After being there for two years, the hospital said that she could come home for Christmas providing she behaved herself.The thought of this made myself and the children very happy, although the cooking would be done by me, and although I had cooked from my years in the scouts, the thought of doing a Christmas Lunch filled me with fear.She asked if I could take her shopping to Marks And Spencer's for some presents, so I agreed.Just as she walked out of the Shop door she felt dizzy, so I managed to get her onto a concrete traffic bollard for a rest, but she fell off onto the pavement.The children gasped in horror and everyone walked on by. That was everyone but a gay gentleman, who I heard later was called Joyce.He came over put his basket of flowers down as supported my wife and talked to her, while I rang for an ambulance.I never saw this man again to say thank-you, but someone in my workplace said that they would find him and thank him from us allJanice was taken back on her ward and given a blood transfusion and then we got her home in time for Christmas.A nurse on the ward who we gathered was actually gay herself, or so we were told, said. It says something when so called \"normal people\" walked by yet, this gay gentleman went out of his way to help you, but it also proves a lot.Yes it did prove quite a lot to me at the time, and to Janice later when she recoveredI have never felt anything about gay people, we are all on the planet together, and we are all different, but this man proved to others that he was no different to them, only he did his best, while they all walked passed.I guess on that day he was our Angel who came along to help us in our time of need, and I have always considered him as that ever sinceI later heard that he got very embarrassed when someone said thank you.I also heard later that the same man had suffered from abuse by others, something I found hard to accept.But this proves that you should never judge a book by its cover, or a person by the way they look.Janice went back into hospital for more operations, but today she is my rock and guardian angel",

The experiment was carried out on both musically experienced and inexperienced participants....+2The research involved participants listening to Mozart (pictured) for 20 minutesThe study showed that genes were enhanced in those deemed 'musically experienced' in areas such as dopamine secretion, which is when a neurohormone is released in the brain, synaptic neurotransmission, which is how neurons receive information, and learning and memory.Meanwhile, the music appeared to down-regulate genes associated with neuro-degeneration, which is the progressive loss of the structure or function of neurons.The researchers said several of the up-regulated genes were ones which are responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds.This suggests a common evolutionary background of sound perception across different species, they said.One of the most affected genes in this area was synuclein-alpha (SNCA), which is also a known risk gene for Parkinson's disease.Study leader Doctor Irma Jarvela, of Helsinki University, said: 'The up-regulation of several genes that are known to be responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds suggest a shared evolutionary background of sound perception between vocalizing birds and humans.'He added: 'The effect was only detectable in musically experienced participants, suggesting the importance of familiarity and experience in mediating music-induced effects.'Dr Jarvela added that the findingscould give give further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying music therapy.The effects of this are still largely unknown.",

Once we have recognised the demon, without secrecy or shame, we can find its weaknesses.\u201dUsing his wit and imagination Terry Pratchett helped fight the stigma around dementiaHis initial reaction, in common with many of the 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK today, was anger and rage.Sir Terry, who passed away last week aged 66, was never going to take his diagnosis in 2007 quietly. He regarded finding he had a form of Alzheimer\u2019s as an insult and decided to do his best to marshal any kind of forces he could against \u201cthis wretched disease... that slips you away a little bit at a time and lets you watch it happen\u201d.He had a rare form of dementia called posterior cortical atrophy, or PCA. It particularly affected his vision and coordination.Unperturbed, the prolific Discworld author continued to write bestselling novels, travelling the globe and entertaining his millions of fans with his work. He enjoyed his life and country pursuits at his idyllic home in rural Wiltshire with his family and friends.Sir Terry also channelled his energy into his passion for making people aware of dementia.He fundamentally changed the way it is seen and understood. He used his voice and time making a difference to those living with dementia now and in the future.When his condition was first diagnosed, he said that he wanted to tell everyone.He didn\u2019t see this as a brave decision. It simply never occurred to Sir Terry not to talk openly about it as he came to terms with his condition while coping with a busy day job as the UK\u2019s top fantasy writer.It is a physical disease, not some mystic curse. Therefore it will fall to a physical cure.Terry PratchettIn 2009 he made a poignant film, broadcast on BBC2, called Terry Pratchett: Living With Alzheimer\u2019s, in which he shared with the world his struggle with the condition.From lending his name and voice to Alzheimer\u2019s Society campaigns to increase funding for research and improve the quality of dementia care in hospitals and care homes, Sir Terry took centre stage at countless conferences, spoke out in media interviews and demanded action from world leaders to stick by their promises to ultimately defeat dementia.From Newsnight to the UK-hosted G8 Summit on Dementia in 2013, he waged a war, so merciless was his onslaught.He said: \u201cI believe that the D-day battle on Alzheimer\u2019s will be engaged quite shortly and a lot of things I\u2019ve heard from experts in the field, not always formally, strengthen that belief. It is a physical disease, not some mystic curse. Therefore it will fall to a physical cure.\u201dHis determination to bring dementia out of the shadows, kicking and screaming if need be, was infectious and encouraged many others newly diagnosed to do the same.He undoubtedly empowered those who previously felt stigmatised to speak out and seek help.Alzheimer\u2019s Society ambassador Graham Browne, aged 58, who lives with the condition, recalls the impact Sir Terry made on him.\u201cWe always had a laugh and there were serious times but through it all we had the same goals.\u201dLast year, Sir Terry took part in a short film with other celebrities to promote our Dementia Friends initiative.The programme is the biggest social action movement to change perceptions of dementia by educating people of all ages and all walks of life about the little things they can do to support people with the condition.With the quick wit and keen sense of humour intrinsic to his writing, his quote for the campaign was: \u201cIt\u2019s possible to live well with dementia and write bestsellers \u2018like wot I do\u2019.\u201dSir Terry was featured in a national TV advert along with a host of celebrities who sang along to the Beatles classic With A Little Help From My Friends, his grey beard and black hat instantly recognisable in the line-up.Last month, we celebrated the fact that one million people have become Dementia Friends and more are joining every day.Sir Terry played a big part in this achievement. He was the truest of champions for people with the condition.When I thanked him for his work, he would simply smile and shake his head modestly, insisting it was nothing, never dwelling on his own dementia.An estimated 60,000 deaths a year are directly attributable to dementia.Sir Terry believed that now is the time to kill the demon before it grows. We owe it to him, those living with dementia today and those who will develop the disease, to increase awareness and raise more funds for vitally needed research into prevention, care and cure.Many people have over the years worked hard to bring dementia out of the shadows, but like myself and others, we were not well known and therefore did not have the impact that Sir Terry had.But it must be remembered that there are many dementia charities working hard to raise awareness of this illness and drag it out from its grim past.Its not always about one large charity or another.Even small charities are doing their bit, and in many cases are more hands on than the larger charities, because they work directly with those who have the illness.It does not always need well know people like TV presenters etc, because as I have been told on many occassions, it works much better coming directly from those who have the illness.Its up to us all to do our bit and help those following in the future",

I admit that this is not easy, as many neurological illnesses likedementia, are not covered well enough in training, although these daysUniversities are trying to catch up, by using people with these illnesses totell others about their daily problems.Another way forward would be for all Hospitals to do their own training,although as conditions are hard in the National Health Service, and time isshort this may well be impossible, due to all of the Government targets theyhave to stick to.But there is no reason why people with these illnesses, should not be askedto give a presentation to any staff wishing to learn more.It\u2019s a well-known fact, that no twopeople with the same illness, struggle with the same symptoms, and problems,but at least by talking and listening to one person the Hospitals are learninghow we deal with things and what to expect, if we struggle.Basic things like support to find out where you are going, finding outwhere the toilets are etc, are all taken for granted, but to us it means quitea lot. Many people like myself sometimes struggle to find the correct toilet as wedon\u2019t always understand the signs, especially toilet signs which can beconfusing to say the least. This is because there seems to be no standard signfor toilets these days.I get round this one by looking at the signs and telling myself that theladies sign is someone with a skirt on, while the gents is a person with legswide apart. This can be distressing but at least having this in my memory I manage tocope. If I get really stuck I head for the disabled toiletBut how many people would understand this, many would simply laugh it offor say we are being silly. This week I had to go into the University Hospital of North Durham, to havean injection in my hip, something I admit, I was not looking forward to, andwas to say the least very nervous, and no longer like Hospitals, in fact I amterrified of them.But the staff here were marvellous, because it was stated in my notes thatI had Lewy Body Dementia. I confess that they made sure I was not left alone ina place I was unsure of, and they kept checking to make sure that I did notworry or wonder off.My wife was allowed to stay with me in a small side ward, until I went off to the theatre, but the standard of care was amazing something my wife remarked on laterThey all spoke in a very friendly manner, and I never heard anyone speakingin an abrupt manner. I also have eyesight problems, so I occasionally have double vision, andalthough I was told that my glasses would be removed during the procedure, Iwas allowed to keep them on all of the time, which meant that I could actuallysee everyone clearly. This was a big help to me as I did not have to struggle trying to see whatwas going on, or who was speaking to meIts little things like this which make such a big difference  Thank goodness for Dragon voice activated software, whichallows me to carry on these days with this blog.

Especially when he said the he looked forward to seeing me at the next clinic.I have heard many negative reports about this hospital but today this was proved to be wrong, and if everyone is treated as I was, they should not be any more sad stories. I know that we all have different experiences, but today these staff were amazingToday I had my faith restored in Hospital Staff and cannot thank them enough",

But does he understand that this process all takes time getting scans and tests done. All these things take time to organise and set up. There is no way that this can work.He also says that more money will be put into dementia research, but I gave heard this before, and when politicians are questioned closely about this, it's not new money, but money already in the system, so are they simply moving money around to suite themselves. The same thing happen with the National Dementia Strategy.Two months ago he was going to pay doctors extra money to diagnose people, then we found out that some doctors were abusing the system and wrongly diagnosing people just to make their records look better.This is at a time when more and more doctors are leaving the National Health Service because of the work load, which all has a knock on effect because if you need to see a doctor it usually takes two or three days in some parts of the country, unless it's an emergency.Hospitals have targets to see more patients faster, and if they are hospitalised, there are targets to get these same people home as fast as possible whether or not they are fit and able to go home in the first place.This government interference only serves to mess the service up, because it's putting these silly targets ahead of good quality care.Years ago things would be discussed in parliament, but now Cameron goes out and discusses things to fit in with himself, and as far as dementia is concerned, I do feel that it's being used as a political tool to get himself out of a mess.Surely it's time to remove these targets and go back to providing the service that this country was accustomed to having, a first class health service.It's also time to stop these governments coming in and changing things like the health service, education and armed forces etc.These are major parts of our country services and to me they should be discussed by all three major parties, before changes are allowed. This is because these politicians have little or no knowledge about these services, so how can the say things need to be changed in a certain way.It's no good to anyone if things keep changing with every government, so it's time to stop it all before the whole of the National Health Service is destroyed.",

It's the nurses and doctors etc who always get the blame, because they are simply following orders from above.Ifthings went wrong in years gone by people were accountable to the hospital or regional board, but now that has gone.Surely if the hospital chief executive did his or her job correctly, we would not need targets.When we look at it, a hospital board usually ran a group of hospitals etc, unlike today where each hospital is independant and has its own independant chief executive and his staff of managers.Perhaps we have a lot to learn by going back to the days where everyone in the health service was qualified in the health service and each individual was accountable. Because whether we liked it or not, a matron and a doctor usually know more about health than some imported industrial chief executive.",

Copy link to paste in your messageResearchers have warned that a controversial scheme to pay GPs \u00a355 for every new case of dementia on their books is leading to patients being wrongly diagnosed. Stock photoThey have found that the number of \u2018inaccurate\u2019 referrals by GPs to memory clinics \u2013 centres to diagnose dementia \u2013 has doubled since the scheme was introduced.A study of 150 patients found that just over half \u2013 52 per cent \u2013 who had been sent to memory clinics for scans since October were later found not to have dementia. This compares to rates of between 25 and 30 per cent before the scheme was introduced.Many had temporary memory problems brought on by depression or old age rather than dementia.Lead researcher Dr Daniel Blackburn, consultant neurologist at the University of Sheffield, said the initiative may be having a \u2018devastating consequence\u2019 on patients and families.The scheme sees practices paid \u00a355 for every new case of dementia recorded on their lists by the end of March.GPs can either make a diagnosis themselves following a series of detailed questions or send patients to memory clinics for scans. But neither system is accurate so it follows that as more patients are sent for tests, the higher the chance of more people being misdiagnosed.Researchers are also concerned that as GPs refer more patients to memory clinics, waiting times increase ever further for those who genuinely do have the illness and need treatment.There is absolutely no evidence to suggest the \u00a355 scheme is leading to patients being wrongly diagnosed by GPsProfessor Alistair Burns, NHS EnglandDr Blackburn, whose study was uncovered by Pulse magazine, said: \u2018We already know there are long waiting lists to be seen and if you send more people who don\u2019t have dementia into those clinics \u2026 it slows down the process.\u2018But also I think there is a risk that if we don\u2019t analyse patients carefully enough then we are going to give people a false diagnosis.\u2019Meanwhile Dr Martin Brunet, a GP in Guildford, Surrey, said there was \u2018no way of knowing if doctors have gamed the system\u2019.He added: \u2018Consider also that someone might have dementia, but the GP knows the memory clinic won\u2019t turn them around before the end of March.\u2018What would you do in that situation? Tell yourself that\u2019s bad luck that the memory clinic has such a long waiting list in your area, or code them as dementia now, knowing that after the end of March you can always change the code if the specialist diagnoses something else.\u2019Figures show that the number of patients diagnosed with dementia has increased seven-fold since the scheme was introduced.There were nearly 35,000 recorded cases in the five months since October 2014 compared to 4,600 between April and September 2014.          Copy link to paste in your messageA study of 150 patients found that just over half who had been sent to memory clinics for scans since October were later found not to have dementia. Stock photoCurrently, around 850,000 adults in Britain have dementia but only 45 per cent have been formally diagnosed with the illness.NHS England say the scheme is only a temporary measure to improve detection rates and will stop after the end of March.Professor Alistair Burns, NHS England's national clinical director for dementia, said: 'High quality, accurate and timely diagnosis of dementia allows people to access the emotional, practical and financial support they need.'There is absolutely no evidence to suggest the \u00a355 scheme is leading to patients being wrongly diagnosed by GPs.'The small study of patients visiting a memory clinic in Sheffield in 2012/13 was carried out long before the introduction of the temporary \u00a355 financial incentive for GPs, launched in late 2014.'It is highly unlikely a patient would be told they have dementia if the GP was not certain - if there is any doubt, the patient will be referred for a further assessment to determine the diagnosis, as is clearly happening in Sheffield.'Last week it emerged that GPs could win bonuses for prescribing fewer antibiotics. Health bosses fear the drugs are being handed out so freely that they are losing their effectiveness and they claim cash incentives will help curb their use.",

        "content": "Iron may be a factor in dementiaby Leigh DaytonDr Dominic Hare at work in his laboratory. Credit: George GanioAlzheimer's disease is no respecter of fame or fortune. Former US president Ronald Reagan had it. Legendary AC/DC guitarist Malcolm Young has been diagnosed. Hazel Hawke suffered until her death in 2013. And author and broadcaster Anne Deveson is experiencing the distressing progression of Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia, a group of brain disorders affecting thinking and memory.There is no way to spot Alzheimer's early, no effective treatment and no known cure. However, a neurochemist at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), Dr Dominic Hare, and his colleagues are homing in on a biomarker, or disease indicator, to help diagnosis.Moreover, Dr Hare \u2013 who is also with the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City \u2013 says the team's work promises to help reveal the cause of the baffling disorder.\"The disease develops so slowly and has so many effects on the body, being able to separate what's cause and what's effect is a big problem,\" he says. \"If we can identify why the disease is happening, we could intervene to alleviate the symptoms and potentially halt the disease process.\"At present, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is made only after careful clinical consultation, and any diagnosis can be confirmed only by examining the brain after death.However, Dr Hare and his co-workers are not looking in the brain for clues. They're looking in the blood. In a recent article in the US journalACS Neuroscience, the group outlined its work with a potential biomarker and a possible causative culprit:iron.\"The body uses metals like copper, zinc and iron to facilitate biochemical reactions it wants. In the case of disease, these are reactions that are unwanted,\" Dr Hare says, adding that iron plays a very important role in the ageing process, and ageing is the key risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. One in four people over the age of 85 have dementia; 75 per cent of those have Alzheimer's.Professor Perminder Sachdev, co-director of the Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing at the University of NSW, says metals have previously been linked to Alzheimer's but the findings were inconclusive.\"This study by Dr Hare and his colleagues is, therefore, of interest to researchers in the field,\" says Professor Sachdev, chief medical adviser to Alzheimer's Australia.Specifically, Dr Hare's team is studying transferrin, a protein that helps ferry iron around the body. In the case of Alzheimer's, if transferrin falls down on the job iron may accumulate in the brain, where it contributes to the build-up of \"plaques\" and \"tangles\". Plaques impede the transmission of signals among brain cells and tangles kill them.To track transferrin's activity, Dr Hare teamed up with Dr Blaine Roberts, head of the Metalloproteomics Laboratory at the Florey Institute. They designed the research using blood samples collected for the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL).The multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional project is one of world's largest studies of the biomarkers, cognitive characteristics and lifestyle factors implicated in Alzheimer's.\"The unique thing about AIBL is that it's following 1000 people through time,\" Dr Hare says. \"That gives us statistical power.\" Participants provide blood samples and are tracked over 54 months.Dr Hare, Dr Roberts and their colleagues used samples from 34 AIBL participants and 36 healthy participants. They employed specialised equipment to analyse samples: an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), and a size exclusion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (SEC-ICP-MS).The results revealed, first, that compared to healthy volunteers, participants with Alzheimer's had lower levels of iron in their plasma, a condition linked with anaemia of unknown cause.Intriguingly, results from the ICP-MS and SEC-ICP-MS tests, showed healthy and Alzheimer's participants had the same amount of transferrin in their blood but that the amount of iron carried by the transferrin was lower in Alzheimer's samples. The implication: transferrin isn't shuttling excess iron efficiently from the brain.\"The next step is to look at a copper-binding protein called ceruloplasmin that interacts with transferrin,\" says Dr Hare. \"Putting all these pieces together will help find methods to maintain quality of life, possibly slowing or even halting the progress of the disease.\"",

Irene wrote \u2018Ellie the Forgetful Elephant \u2018 to support children in understanding what happens when someone has dementia, so they can continue to connect with people  who are affected by the condition.Through support from DSDNI the Deed project enabled Year 8 students from St Cecilia\u2019s College to write a song to accompany the book, ably supported by St Cecilia\u2019s music department. The year 8 students  recently performed their musical jingles for Mayor Brenda Stevenson at the Deed ceremony hosted by the school.Donna Deery (Deed Old Library Trust said: \u201cWe did the workshops with the girls and staff, and when the whole  school was trained we them up for the award. \u201cOn Thursdays we did a memory group when the girls were able to work with people with dementia and develop skills.\u201cDementia can be scary for adults to deal with,  never mind children. \u201cThere is the fear of doing the wrong thing, so what we are doing is breaking the taboo of what is dementia, how we treat people with dementia, giving people with dementia courtesy and respect.Leanne Monk explained how those taking part included first year pupils right up to upper sixth.

Dementia affects more than 830,000 people in the UK and costs the economy \u00a323bn a year, the charity says.The Drug Discovery Institutes will see about 90 new research scientists, recruited over the next five years, employed in state-of-the-art facilities to fast-track the development of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.The last treatment for dementia was licensed in the UK 12 years ago. At the G8 Dementia Summit a year ago, health leaders from across the world pledged a research ambition for a disease-modifying therapy for dementia by 2025.'Devastating condition' Alzheimer's Research UK says that with one dementia researcher for every six working on cancer, attracting new expertise to tackle the growing global health problem is crucial.Dr Eric Karran, director of research at the charity, said: \"Working in universities and hospitals alongside people affected by dementia and their families, academic researchers are best placed to take research breakthroughs and progress them into real world benefits for the people that so desperately need them. \"The Drug Discovery Alliance is one of the first of its kind for dementia research in the world. \"We're providing the investment and infrastructure that is needed to maintain and grow a healthy pipeline of potential new treatments to take forward into clinical testing.\"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, said: \"Dementia can be a devastating condition and I am committed to doing all that we can to help the thousands of people who live with it. \"These world-leading Institutes will bring new hope to people with dementia by boosting innovation and increasing collaboration so that we can achieve our aim of finding a cure or disease-modifying therapy.\" ",

GETTYScientist are being encourage to find cures for the disease by 2025Launched today the venture sees world experts come together for the first time in a joint bid to help millions beat the devastating illness.Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association in America and the Weston Brain Institute in Canada have joined forces to create a fund to encourage scientists to find cures for it by 2025.The move comes as a new report by care experts shows that dementia has now become our number one health concern, overtaking cancer for the first time. Latest estimates show that more than two million Britons will suffer from dementia by 2050.According to the Live-In Homecare Information Hub \u2013 which provides help on allowing people to access care in their own homes \u2013 almost half of over-55s now admit to being frightened of suffering from dementia.This compares with 28 per cent who fear cancer and nine per cent afraid of a stroke. Only three per cent said that they were worriedabout heart disease which is currently the biggest killer in the UK.It is the race to contain the dementia epidemic that has inspired the creation of the new \u00a31million fund to find a \u201ccure or disease-modifying treatment\u201d.Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise people express a fear of dementia, which has a devastating impact on those whose lives it touches, and for which there is currently no cure.            More and more of us have relatives, friends and neighbours who are affected by the disease        Caroline Abrahams\u201cWith 830,000 people in the UK living with dementia today and that number set to rise, finding treatments for the diseases that cause it must be our number one priority.\u201cThese results also suggest people are more willing to talk about dementia than they were a decade ago and it\u2019s vital these shifting attitudes are reflected in a newly galvanised effort to fight the condition through research.\u201dResearchers are pinning their hopes on two new drugs, called Solanezumab and MK-8931.Both are to be clinically tested in months, and within two years scientists say they could provide them with the holy grail of a cure.Dr Karran added: \u201cWe could be close or a long way away but I am hopeful we have made significant progress.\u201cWe should have the results of the phase three trials (of the drugs) in a couple of years and if they work we will have a disease-modifying therapy.\u201cIt\u2019s crucial we find disease-modifying treatments because there is a real risk dementia will affect the economy.\u201cThe cost to the healthcare system will be absolutely enormous and could one day be unsustainable.\u201dProfessor June Andrews, of Stirling University, said: \u201cPeople have recently been given the good news that most cancer will respond to treatment but they are often told there is no cure for dementia, so it is understandable they might be afraid.\u201dCaroline Abrahams, of Age UK, added: \u201cMore and more of us have relatives, friends and neighbours who are affected by the disease.\u201cIt is essential that we talk about it, dispel the myths and focus on how to ensure people with dementia and their families get the care and support they need.\u201d",

        "content": "      A \u00a35 million investment will give new researchers the chance to help the fight against dementia. Nottingham is one of the places to benefit. Health Correspondent Peter Blackburn reports.RODNEY Fogg has seen the huge difference a simple sing-a-long can make first hand.AdvertisementPeople who have been previously made unlikely to speak, smile, or even move, due to their dementia can tap their hand on their legs, remember lyrics with a joyous look on their faces and even spring to their feet.What was once a dour nursing home can become a place of hope and families suddenly get a glimpse of what their loved one used to be like before the onset of the degenerative disease.   \u201cI am quite impressed by how music does affect people who have dementia,\u201d Mr Fogg - who lives in Radcliffe-on-Trent said.\u201cWhen Pamela was having day treatment and day care some of the events that were put on by organisations involved sing a longs and adult choirs and things like that involving not only the people suffering from dementia but their supporters and relatives with them too. A lot of that was trying to pick music and tunes familiar to them from their past.\u201cPeople who are quite dour usually will suddenly respond - they might tap their legs, or even start dancing and get animated - there is clearly something there that triggers something pleasant and comfortable. It\u2019s a joy really - you don\u2019t get a lot of response from people with dementia and to get some sort of reaction is quite nice and quite rewarding.\u201dIt is people like Rodney, and his wife Pamela, who could be helped in the future by a new scheme that has received \u00a35 million - including some money in Nottingham.The money will pay for a new research \u2018hub\u2019 looking at how painting, puppetry, singing and other arts can improve dementia.The project which will be based at both the University of Nottingham and University of Worcester has been paid for by the ALzheimer\u2019s Society and will support six new PhD students to investigate the impact of creative arts activities on people living with dementia in residential homes and in the community.The results will then be used to influence treatment and care given to people with the disease.Professor Justine Schneider, lead researcher for the project at Nottingham University said: \u201cWe know that activity groups can help people with dementia and their carers to stay socially connected and to enjoy a better quality of life, but there has been very little research done to show the value of creative arts activities.\u201cThe project will train PhD students to develop a strong evidence base for the use of arts in dementia, highlighting which types of activities bring the most benefit and at what stage in the dementia journey, helping to guide the development of future services.\u201dThe training centre will be one of eight new centres across the UK that will explore different areas of dementia research. Collectively they will support 55 new PhD students and clinical research fellows over three years, giving a huge boost to the numbers of researchers working in dementia.Mr Fogg said: \u201cIt could be really valuable. it just depends how far they can take it.\u201dPippa Foster, Operations Manager for Alzheimer\u2019s Society in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire said: \u2018There\u2019s a huge amount of progress being made by the dementia research community but unless we attract and train the best young talent we will limit how quickly we can make ground breaking discoveries. For too long dementia research has been underfunded and as a result we have significantly fewer scientists than other conditions, with six times more people working in cancer than dementia.\u2018If we\u2019re going to defeat dementia we need to give the best brains the right opportunities and build a research workforce that is fit for the future. That\u2019s why we\u2019re proud to be announcing the largest investment of its kind, which will see \u00a35 million committed to create the next generation of dementia researchers. This hub in Nottingham and Worcester is a vital and innovative part of that, and we are particularly excited to discover more about how creative arts can help people with dementia to live better lives.\u201d",

But they said that it would be fine.Once we had got there and registered, we sat down and made sure that our mobile phones were turned off as instructed. There are signs all over the walls telling people not to use mobile phones and to turn them off, so that they do not cause problems or distractions with other patients.But it's amazing just how many people completely ignore this and carry on texting etc.I then went to get weighed and measured, before we went into a room to discuss any illnesses that we may have, like my Lewy body dementia. What's that the nurse asked? My wife explained it all to her, and went through my medication, even though then next visit is for the day ward, where it will be completed next month.The nurse then took my blood pressure and got slightly agitated because I have a tremour in my right arm.After this was explained she decided to hold it tight onto the desk top, because she said any movement would cause the machine to play up.I confess that I had never heard of this before, but I know that I am not the only person with a tremour due to parkinsons etc, but it's never been explained before.Then going back to my Lewy body dementia, she asked if I needed a named nurse to keep an eye on me while I was at the day ward. I sad no because I always try to do as I am told, but if I need anything I would ask. As long as I have my walking stick I am fine.I think that this lady was at a loss to know how to cope with my predicament, but as I said at the time, I try to remain independant while I can.I should not complain as the staff were wonderful today, even if they look at you a little odd when you tell them that you have an illness like LEWY Body Dementia.",

Dementia    1. Lumiosity \u2013 Brain Teaser       There are a range of puzzles and brain teasers for people in the app which helps the people behind luminosity to create a bespoke package of puzzles to stimulate and engage users.  It adapts to a person\u2019s age and shows people how they compare with others in similar age brackets. The games involve swiping the screen in different directions and responding to commands on screen that might be more appropriate for someone in the early stages of dementia.  2. Alzheimer's Dementia Day Clock    This app will inform a person with dementia that it is early morning, afternoon or night.  By simplifying the time options, this app has been found to decrease common anxieties and confusion people with dementia have about what time it is if they have lost track of the cycle of time.    Games    3. Magic Kaleido     Magic Kaleido is an easy way to be creative and engage a person with art on their tablet.  The app allows users to draw patterns in a range of colours, shapes and styles and share with family and friends.  The app could be used as a form of art therapy as it provides mental stimulation controlled by the user.  4. Solve Crosswords         Crosswords might be popular activities for someone in the early ages of dementia and this app allows someone to continue their hobby and receive hints at a difficulty level they can select.    5. Touch Pets Dogs     For animal lovers there are lots of apps where a person can stroke, interact and feed their on screen pet which makes sounds and reacts to the person\u2019s attention. The app recreates the bond between a pet and their owner. Although not the same as a real animal, people who used to own a pet might enjoy using this app which gives them responsibility and companionship.    Health    6. GPS Tracker Pro    The app allows people to track and see where friends and family members are.  As well as seeing if someone is running late, the GPS Tracker could be used as a safety device for older people to provide information about where someone might be if they become confused and lost or in need of support. 7. Medisafe Med and Pill Reminder    The app understands the barriers facing people taking medication and is able to adapt its work to help people remain as safe as possible.    Researchers behind the app found a combination of individual and condition specific factors were causing people to miss medicate themselves, whether taking too much medication or not enough or even at the wrong time.  The app understands that there are often other family members involved in the medication process and works to keep them informed and involved in improving medication adherence.  Communication    8. The Wireless \u2013 Age UK     This app lets you download the dedicated radio station for older people and is filled with topical features, debates and songs that are created to engage and entertain and older audience.  The radio has been set up in partnership with Age UK and is only available online or on digital radio.  9. Word Press    Whether users are writers or readers, Word Press keeps people up to date with blogs on the internet.  The app allows writers to take down key thoughts and feelings and people can also read about topics of interest or follow blogs about their interests.  10. Viber    Viber allows people to communicate through phone and video, messages and picture messages for free. It is an alternative to skype and can be used on tablets, smart phones and desktop computers.            Age UK has just closed its annual Digital Champion of the Year competition and judging will soon take place to find out who will be named the 2014 champions.     The contest seeks out the most inspiring older people to have embraced technology and used it to improve their lives and others.      Stephen Fry was one of last year\u2019s judges and is a self-confessed technophile, who was one of the first celebrities to start using social media site Twitter when it was created nearly a decade ago.     He said: \u201cLike millions of others, I simply can\u2019t imagine a life without the convenience and wonder of the internet. Yet over 5 million older people have never been online. I was delighted to help choose Age UK\u2019s Internet Champions for 2013 and wish them all the best in inspiring more people to the ways of the web.\u201d  Older people keen to get online    Despite the number of people who have never used the internet is estimated at around five million, a research study found that the majority of older people who have engaged with the internet showed an openness to learning and a curiosity about the internet that led them to learn about technology that had captivated their family.      The majority of people who had already explored the internet had done so because of younger family members and it was family who were keen to provide support for older people as they learned about different uses of technology.      Ofcom published a report last year which revealed a sharp increase in people over the age of 65 using the internet, with the amount of older people accessing the internet increasing from 33 per cent in 2012 to over 42 per cent in a year.  This number is expected to continue increasing and research carried out by Anchor revealed tablets were found to be the most desired Christmas present requested by older people in 2013.    Anchor's chief executive Jane Ashcroft said: \u201cOlder people are still keen to keep up to date with technology and previous Anchor research has shown that buying older relatives mobile phones or setting them up on social media or Skype can help them to keep in touch.  \u201cIt can be hard to buy for people who are older than you, but these results show that your grandparents\u2019 wish-lists might not be all that different from your own.\u201d  The number of people who do not have the internet and have no intention of getting the internet has also decreased and an estimated 11 per cent of the UK population do not have internet.  Compared to 2012, when 15 per cent on the population did not have any intentions of getting the internet, the figure is expected to continue decreasing. ",

GETTY/PIC POSED BY MODELThe study revealed that genetic signals that increase the risk of developing dementia A study, led by the University of Edinburgh, found that some people are more at risk of conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s, due to genetic makeup.Some 850,000 Britons have the brain disease but this could soar to 4.5 million in 40 years.Using DNA data from 54,000 people, aged over 45, all over the world researchers pinpointed genetic signals that make them more likely to develop dementia.Experts hope further studies can be carried out on the \u201cbiological mechanisms\u201d which make these genes work.These small genetic signals are like the first lights on a distant shore        Professor Ian DearyIt raises the possibility of treatments to prevent the condition developing.The study, published in Molecular Psychiatry, uncovered small signals from four genetic regions associated with strong thinking skills.Professor Ian Deary said: \u201cWe knew that general thinking skills in older age were heritable to some extent, but we did not know which genes were involved.\u201cThese small genetic signals are like the first lights on a distant shore.\u201dJames Goodwin, head of research at Age UK, which part funded the study, said: \u201cThese findings are a real breakthrough \u2013 for the first time identifying genes that influence the way our brains work in older age.\u201d",

Am your nurse or doctor today.It has been pointed out that staff should introduce themselves to the patient, and then explain what they are going to do, ie give you an injection or clean your wound etc.while this is a wonderful idea, I do wonder if it will work in practice as many Doctors, and Nurses, seem to be running around with little or no time for the patient.Ialso wonder if this is done in their training these days, and whether they are allowed enough time on the wards or clinics to actually get the time to speak to those in their care.A few months ago I had to go for an X-ray at a hospital, and was taken back when this young lady came up to me, checked my name and invited to to walk into the X-ray department.From here I got what I thought was a very formal introduction, which threw me slightly, because it looked like something I had seen on television something like speed dating, although when she had finished I felt totally relaxed and at ease.She explained why I was there, and what she was going to do, and even though I have had many X-rays before, this put a different slant on it. It was a more caring and personal way of dealing with someone these days,It was not just a case of strip off and stand over there until you are told to move.I had never come across this apart from my physiotherapist who did this the first time I went to see her, although on this occassion my wife was with me, as it was to do with my balance and knee problems.On reflection it is a lovely idea to feel that you are put at ease, and feel as if the staff actually care, your not just another number or person that they have to see.I guess that's it is different if you are an inpatient on a ward, as you will see many different people, coming up to do different things during the day and at night, but if it works it could be a night idea.This will go along way to help those who have dementia, etc as it may well help them to settle knowing that people are trying to be friendly.",

They think that everyone is wealthy like themselves, and anyone who is not, is not worth bothering with.I like many others felt sick when I heard of government ministers laughing at those waiting at food banks, because they are desperate, and I wonder just how people like this can become government ministers in the first place.If we want the health service to survive in the future, we must start rebuilding state care homes, where the less well off can go when they need to, because it takes the pressure off the hospitals.It's time to look after those who worked to get this country back on its feet.As a person who has voted conservative for most of my life, I now feel totally sick at what this government is doing, and wonder what will happen at the next election.This country cannot carry on with these savage cuts to services, where we live, and I for one will be voting for someone else who I hope will care for the sick elderly and poor in the future.I think we should all look carefully at who we elect in the future and make sure that they are there for the electorate or not there just to fill there pockets.Let us hope that we can get more affordable care homes in the future, and think of those less well off.",

But the Engage Foundation Advisory Panel - a panel made up of customers - decided to pool remaining funds from the year to create an additional community award.Following a panel vote, Linda was overjoyed to be told that the Berwick and District Friends of Dementia Active Mind and Body project would receive the valuable \u00a35,000 funding after all.She said: \u201cThis has come as a huge surprise and a tremendous boost for us all.\u201cWe run a weekly support and social group for people with dementia \u2013 and their carers \u2013 and this award means we can introduce a range of dementia-friendly activities such as art and craft sessions as well as music and movement, all known to be beneficial to dementia sufferers.\u201dShe added: \u201cThere is a dearth of dementia-specific support groups in and around Berwick aimed at those living with early to moderate stage dementia.\u201cIn addition, there is very little public transport suitable for people with dementia, and now we can help those vulnerable people who otherwise cannot use public transport, attend the session through use of community transport and volunteer drivers, offering much more flexibility and scope.\u201cThis is really important because we\u2019re located in a remote rural area and so operate an open door policy, welcoming people from both sides of the English/Scottish border.\u201dAs a mutual organisation, Engage is owned by, and run for, its customers.The Engage Foundation was set up to provide customers with personal grants, and awards for community projects.Customers can apply to help what matters to them in their corner of the world (the communities in which they live). All customers need to do to be considered, is apply.The funding pot is made possible due to the financial stability of the customer-owned organisation which provides life and health insurance, and a variety of savings products.Nigel Hunter, Head of Community at Engage Mutual, said: \u201cWhen we set up the Engage Foundation earlier on in the year we did so with one overriding objective: to enable customers to benefit from the financial success of their business.\u201cWe think it\u2019s great to be able to help a community project or a good cause that our customers feel passionate about.\u201cWe wish everyone at the Berwick and District Friends of Dementia all the very best with their valuable work and will enjoy catching up with the group to see how the funds help them improve things for local sufferers of dementia and their carers and families.\u201dHe added: \u201cAnd if there are others in the Berwick area, both individuals seeking personal grants and community groups looking for funding, then all they need to do is visit www.engagemutual.com/foundation.\u201dBerwick and District Friends of Dementia runs a weekly support and social group for people with dementia and their carers, and will use the additional funding to introduce a range of dementia friendly activities such as art/craft sessions, music and physical activities.It aims to create a stimulating environment for people with dementia and carers through increased mental and physical wellbeing, enrich lives and strengthen relationships.The community award will allow Berwick & District Friends of Dementia to use appropriately skilled group workers to facilitate twice monthly sessions and buy suitable resources for the sessions.",

The researchers only looked at older people and found the increased risk appeared when people took drugs every day for three years or more.Side-effects All medicines can have side-effects and anticholinergic-type drugs that block a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine are no exception. \u201cStart QuoteWe would encourage doctors and pharmacists to be aware of this potential link \u201dEnd Quote Dr Doug Brown from the UK's Alzheimer's Society Patient information leaflets accompanying such drugs warn of the possibility of reduced attention span and memory problems as well as a dry mouth. But researchers say people should also be aware that they may be linked to a higher risk of developing dementia.Dr Shelly Gray and colleagues from the University of Washington followed the health of 3,434 people aged 65 and older who had no signs of dementia at the start of the study. They looked at medical and pharmacy records to determine how many of the people had been given a drug with an anticholinergic effect, at what dose and how often and compared this data with subsequent dementia diagnoses over the next decade.

SHARE PICTURE                Copy link to paste in your message+2Researchers from the University of Edinburgh found a clear geographical divide in rates of dementia\u2018Statistics have revealed that middle-aged Scots living in the Grampian area \u2013 around Aberdeen \u2013 are more likely to develop the disease compared to those who live on the border with England.\u2018The next step is to pin down what these factors could be. Given that two to threefold variation, it is not going to be one factor \u2013 but if you could identify what these factors are and optimise them in the whole population, you could potentially halve dementia rates.\u2019Mr Russ stressed the study based on data for Swedish twins allowed the researchers to eliminate any genetic factors which might explain the north-south divide.The north-south divide does make you think about latitude and it may be it is something to do with sunlight exposure and vitamin D \u2013 that is a possibility and it has certainly been linked to healthy brain function and dementiaTom Russ, of Edinburgh UniversityHe said: \u2018In the Scottish study, everybody was born in 1921, so they will have experienced different things all at the same time \u2013 for example, they will all have been the same age when the NHS was introduced.\u2018By middle age, there was a big variation across Scotland and it was a similar pattern: higher in the north and lower in the south.\u2019There are currently about 850,000 people with dementia in the UK, and the number is predicted to reach more than one million by 2025, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Society.Research published last year found that older people with low levels of vitamin D were more than twice as likely to develop dementia.The body makes most of its vitamin D from sunlight on the skin, but older people can be less efficient at doing this.Although the vitamin is found in oily fish, and is routinely added to milk, diet accounts for very little of the nutrient that actually makes it into the bloodstream.Other studies have also suggested that those with a vitamin D deficiency are more likely to experience cognitive problems.Lindsay Kinnaird, research manager at Alzheimer Scotland, said: \u2018If we are able to identify environmental risk factors, then we have the opportunity to make adaptations to lifestyle that can minimise their impact.\u2019",

Each of the patients taking part in the study had a GRN mutation. The aim was to recreate damaged neurons in the laboratory.But the researchers found that iPSCs derived from the patients\u2019 were unable to generate cortical neurons, the cell type most affected by FTD. Cortical neurons are the cells responsible for most of the brain\u2019s complex higher activity enabling thought, perception and voluntary movement.The findings, reported in the journal Stem Cell Reports, indicated that defective GRN altered the Wnt signalling pathway, which plays an important role in neuronal development.Inhibiting Wnt either with genetic correction or a drug compound restored the ability of the stem cells to convert into cortical neurons.Co-author Dr Catherine Verfaillie, from the University of Leuven in Belgium, said: \u201cIPSC models can now be used to better understand dementia, and in particular frontotemporal dementia, and might lead to the development of drugs that can curtail or slow down the degeneration of cortical neurons.\u201dIn their paper, the scientists suggested that the underlying causes of dementia \u201cmay often already be present earlier during life\u201d.They add: \u201cSignalling events required for neurodevelopment may also play major roles in neurodegeneration and \u2026 targeting such pathways \u2013 as for instance, the WNT pathway presented in this study \u2013 may result in the creation of novel therapeutic approaches for FTD.\u201d",

In a questionnaire, participants were asked if they had any issues with their memory.Continue reading the main story After analysing the results, researchers from Erasmus University Rotterdam found an increased risk of stroke in people who had earlier complained of memory lapses.But the risk of stroke was even higher if participants had a high level of education, defined as higher vocational education or university training.Cognitive reserve Arfan Ikram, associate professor of neuroepidemiology at Erasmus University, said that education was a good indicator of the brain's ability to fight against cognitive damage, such as dementia.This ability, known as cognitive reserve, is usually built up during childhood and early adulthood, and is thought to protect against damage to the brain.He said: \"In people with a high level of education, it takes longer for the brain to be damaged and for dementia to occur.\"But if these people start complaining about their memory, then the mechanism is gone. \"This can be an indicator they have reached an advanced stage, when the cognitive reserve is not compensating any more.\"As a result, Prof Ikram said, memory problems can be an important warning sign in this sub-group, \"telling you to keep a watch on this person\".A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain either becomes blocked by a clot or bursts.When that happens, part of the brain cannot get the blood and oxygen it needs and so brain cells die.The Stroke Association says medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol can increase the risk of having a stroke. Leading a healthy lifestyle, keeping physically active and stopping smoking can all help to reduce the major risks.In addition, Prof Ikram says people should start early to maintain brain health in later life - something which is as important as physical health, in the fight against stroke and dementia.",

In some cases, the condition can progress to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It is thought that brain cells need insulin to survive, and that a drop in levels can lead to brain cell damage.            Copy link to paste in your messageResearchers have found that a twice-daily dose of a nasal spray can combat memory loss (file photograph)The new trial, with 240 patients, follows research which shows that insulin not only reduces memory decline, but may slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s. Furthermore, it is also known that poorly controlled diabetes can lead to memory loss.In a year-long study led by doctors at Wake Forest University medical school in the U.S., patients with mild cognitive impairment or early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease will use a nasal spray containing either insulin or a placebo.The spray will be used 30 minutes after breakfast and dinner, as earlier trials show this is when brain cells absorb the most insulin.The team will carry out a battery of memory tests on the patients, and also scan their brains to monitor any changes. \u2018Information gained from the study has the potential to move nasal insulin forward rapidly as a therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u2019 say the researchers.NEW PILL TO COMBAT DEMENTIAScientists are developing a new daily memory pill to tackle the early signs of dementia.The drug acts on the brain chemical N-methyl-D-aspartate, or NMDA, low levels of which have been associated with memory and learning problems.In a trial at China Medical University, 50 people will be given the drug or a placebo for 24 weeks. Doctors will carry out various verbal learning and memory tests before and after the trial.\u2018The results will have considerable clinical and scientific significance, and growing evidence has shown that insulin carries out multiple functions in the brain and that insulin dysregulation may contribute to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u2019The trial follows a smaller study, funded by the U.S. National Institute of Aging, which showed that short-term use of insulin preserved memory. Those who used insulin also had a slower rate of physical damage in the brain associated with progress of the disease.Commenting on the study, Dr Clare Walton, research manager at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said: \u2018Researchers are increasingly finding links between type 2 diabetes and dementia, and are now testing diabetes drugs as potential treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u2018We believe that the concept of drug \u201crepurposing\u201d, where drugs already licensed for one condition may be beneficial for others such as dementia, has enormous potential to deliver new treatments faster and cheaper than producing a new drug from scratch.

Now we\u2019re asking whether it can do the same for another vital organ - the brain.\u2019Dr Doug Brown, of Alzheimer\u2019s Society, added: \u2018Drug development can take decades and sadly, the path towards developing dementia treatments over the past decade is littered with drugs that have failed in clinical trials.\u2018As we learn more about the causes of dementia and its links to other conditions, there is hope that treatments we routinely use for other diseases may also work for people with dementia.

Research like this is a huge part of that goal.\u2019Alzheimer\u2019s Society is also funding research exploring whether an experimental diabetes drug could help reverse the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.Professor Christian Holscher, of Lancaster University, has previously shown that diabetes drugLiraglutide could reverse memory loss and the build-up of plaques in the brain which lead to Alzheimer's.The new study will follow up on this work.",

We also see people pushing their way into a train before others can got offThis is all done regardless of anyone else who may be around.It seems as if common sense and manners have been totally done away with.We are told to keep to the left, yet people coming the other direction, keep pushing you over.Kings Cross underground has changed so much, that it's become a nightmare too, as the pedestrian tunnel is far too long, which now fills me with complete dread.I think that this is because the walls are curved, and this causes problems with my balance, as I like to have a wall close by, when things get busy. The problem is that my feet catch the wall, but I need to reach out to touch the wall due to the curve, and this makes things feel unstable. Obviously the people at the top of these businesses, do not talk to those who have this illness, otherwise they would change things to suit us.Perhaps the Mayor of London should take this on board as it would help all with dementia living in London",

This is a grey area, because people could be influenced by others rather than hat they want.I do feel that this is something which needs to be looked at so that those who have these illness are supported to get involved in voting, and are allowed to vote for themselves.",

I never realised until much later that viral pneumonia had actually wiped much of my memory clean, and much of my job had disappeared, never to return.I gather that there are many illness which can mimic dementia, but I do not understand this at all.",

I'm not directly dealing with it, as I live in Canada, but my uncle, who lives in Colombia, South America is who suffered it, been diagnosed about 4 years ago. His father, my grandpa, suffered from Parkinson's, so at the beginning we thought my uncle had it also. Now, we think that because my uncle was a university professor in chemistry for many decades, the exposure to many chemicals at the labs could' be a factor in developing this disease. However, we don't know for sure. Unfortunately in Colombia the information and resources are even more limited that in NorthAmerica. We are also trying to find if there is a way his brain can be donated for further studies that in a future can conduct to find a cure for the LBD. If you have any related information whether regarding the body donation, or the relationship between chemicals and the disease, I would greatly appreciate if you could share it with us. I would also would like to ask your permission for sharing your blog with my relatives, especially those who are taking direct care of my uncle, to help them to understand more the processes and circumstances he is enduring.Many thanks in advance for your understanding!Sandra Nathalia Bellina.Lewy Body AssociationLewy Body Society.org,ukLewyNet.co.UK",

        "content": "From the Daily MailWhen Parkinson\u2019s and dementia strike together: Reports suggest Robin Williams suffered this cruel double blowBoth Parkinson\u2019s and dementia affects around 100,000 BritonsRobin Williams might have been affected by this ghastly disorderHe\u2019d suffered from Parkinson\u2019s for three years+2It has been reported that Robin Williams may have been affected by ParkinsonianThey are two of the most devastating conditions \u2014 but the cruel double whammy of both Parkinson\u2019s and dementia affects around 100,000 Britons.These people have Parkinsonian symptoms \u2014 slow movement and problems with gait \u2014 as well as confusion, memory loss, hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia.They may get Parkinson\u2019s first, then develop dementia a year or more later \u2014 known as Parkinson\u2019s dementia.Or, if dementia is diagnosed before or at the same time as Parkinson\u2019s symptoms develop, they are said to have \u2018dementia with Lewy bodies\u2019 \u2014 a type of dementia that shares symptoms with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s.Parkinson\u2019s dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies are the same problem \u2014 the difference is the order of the symptoms.It\u2019s been reported that the actor Robin Williams might have been affected by this ghastly disorder when he took his life this summer.He\u2019d suffered from Parkinson\u2019s for three years \u2014 then last week a leaked pathologist\u2019s report revealed there was \u2018diffuse Lewy body dementia\u2019 in his brain.Lewy bodies are tiny clumps of abnormal proteins produced by the brain when its cells are not working properly.They cause memory problems, although these don\u2019t tend to be as severe as with Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 which is linked to a build-up of the protein beta-amyloid.Another key difference is that Lewy body dementia affects regions of the brain responsible for vision, causing powerful hallucinations, nightmares and spatial-awareness problems.Studies suggest that up to 80 per cent of people with Parkinson\u2019s will develop Parkinson\u2019s dementia.Professor David Burn, clinical director of the charity Parkinson\u2019s UK, says: \u2018People with Parkinson\u2019s will already have Lewy bodies in the bottom of the brain, which controls movement.'In Parkinson\u2019s dementia, the Lewy bodies spread up to areas involved in memory, cognition and vision.\u2018For the patient with dementia with Lewy bodies, the problem starts at the top of the brain and spreads down \u2014 they tend to go to their doctor with cognitive problems, then develop Parkinson\u2019s or get both simultaneously.\u2019In your 50s, the illness is more likely to start as Parkinson\u2019s. Dementia with Lewy bodies usually affects people in their 70s, says Ian McKeith, professor of old-age psychiatry at Newcastle University and chairman of the Lewy Body Society.Diagnosis is usually via a brain scan that tests for dopamine, a chemical that is lower in people with Parkinson\u2019s and Lewy body dementia.Symptoms vary \u2014 but it\u2019s a harsh blow for patients, says Professor Burn.Margaret Kelly would agree. Her husband Reggie, 76, a father-of-three and former supermarketmanager, was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia in 2009, when he was 71.+2Up to 80 per cent of people with Parkinson\u2019s will develop Parkinson\u2019s dementia\u2018Every form of Alzheimer\u2019s is cruel, but I do think this is the cruellest,\u2019 says Margaret, 75, from North-East London.\u2018Reggie was such a fit man. Now he\u2019s like a baby. He can\u2019t speak and he\u2019s so confused he doesn\u2019t know me any more.\u2019Four years before his diagnosis, Reggie couldn\u2019t move his legs away from the sink while washing up.Margaret then started noticing changes in his behaviour \u2014 he would become quiet and expressionless at times.A GP diagnosed depression, but antidepressants didn\u2019t help.Reggie went on to develop a shuffling gait, and in 2006 a neurologist diagnosed Parkinson\u2019s.Medication helped control those symptoms but in 2009 Reggie\u2019s behaviour changed dramatically.\u2018He became terribly aggressive,\u2019 says Margaret.\u2018He\u2019d wreck the shed looking for a screwdriver. He\u2019d never admit he couldn\u2019t remember where it was.\u2019Memory tests showed signs of Lewy body dementia. Around this time, Reggie started having hallucinations, some of which were horrific.Since his 40s, he\u2019d suffered with nightmares and restless leg syndrome \u2014 the urge to move your legs at night.It is thought there may be a link between sleep disturbances and Parkinson\u2019s and Lewy bodies.The cause of Lewy body dementia is largely unknown but the risk increases with age. Both Lewy body dementia and Parkinson\u2019s are slightly more common in men.Patients may be prescribed Parkinson\u2019s medication and cholinesterase inhibitors, such as Aricept and Exelon.These particularly help with hallucinations, says Professor McKeith. Correct diagnosis is vital, as some Parkinson\u2019s drugs can worsen hallucinations.A U.S. study found half of patients with Lewy body dementia saw the doctor more than ten times before diagnosis.Although dementia and Parkinson\u2019s specialists are well aware of Lewy bodies dementia, GPs and the public are less so.Motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s can mask cognitive issues.And hallucinations, delusions and movement problems aren\u2019t usually associated with dementia, as Bridget Hunt discovered after her mother Rose developed Lewy body dementia.\u2018We never thought it could be dementia because of the hallucinations,\u2019 says Bridget, 60, of York. Rose started seeing things in her early 70s.Other symptoms included struggling to add up, shuffling, a tremor in her arm and spatial-awareness problems.At 80, she was finally diagnosed with Lewy body dementia. Aricept slowed the disease down, but her increasing disorientation is difficult to witness, says Bridget.While Rose still lives at home, Reggie moved to a care home in 2011 after a serious fall. Margaret, who is disabled, visits him every week.\u2018I desperately want to take him home,\u2019 she says. \u2018He\u2019s not the same man I knew but we\u2019ve still got him.\u2019",

        "content": "Many people including local councillors think that once they have done a dementia friends course, they know it all, and need not do anything else, something that many know is wrong.A dementia friends course is only the first step, and we are supposed to take things further, but how many do.I have seen a few communities go dementia friendly, and they have thrown even thing at it, to ensure that people with dementia get a better deal and are treated with respect. But to many, it's just a badge and nothing else.To ensure that communities are genuinely dementia friendly, we must also consider things like traffic calming, something that Durham County a Council refuses to do.In our town the traffic races in from the bypass, and then races through the town.There are very few places where you can cross safely unless you are on the main shopping street, where there are pelican crossings.In our area where there are a lot of elderly and a care home, but you just have to take your chances at crossing the road, because the motorists start to accelerate once you step onto the road.I heard a few months ago that this town was going to become dementia friendly, but how can they, when they don't consider things like traffic calming etc, which not only have an effect on people with dementia but also many disabled, people with hearing or eyesight problems.However there are problems on the main shopping street also, because even though this is supposed to be buses only, and restricted to 30 miles per hours, ambulances sometimes race through the town centre at speeds sometimes exceeding 40 miles per hour. The fact is that some parts of the road are very narrow, as are the footpaths, so if you are not careful you can be hit by the wing mirrors of buses etc as they pass.I have had to jump a few times when my hearing has been playing up, so how will someone with other illnesses cope.I once spent a whole day doing two sessions at county hall talking about dementia, and at the end I realised that apart from possibly 6 people out of well over 50, who were interested, the rest did not care less, and I am convinced things are still the same.This council refuses to reduce the speed limit to 20 in this area alone even though there are two schools, a church and a care home within 500 yards, they also refuse to have crossings until someone is either killed or injured, so can this town and county ever be dementia friendly, I think not.The sad thing is that many of these councillors either moved in to take up council positions, or they are union people doing the job as community work in councils to help them selves up the ladder, they were not born here, neither have they lived here for long. I guess it's the same in many counties.But we must remember that dementia friendly towns etc, is more that putting a dementia friends sticker on a shop window, it's also about making towns safer to live in.If people are genuine about dementia friends and dementia friendly towns and villiages, they must take on board, that's it's far more that just making shops dementia friendly, it's also the enviornment we live in.If these councils are really genuine about being dementia friendly, they should listen to people who have the illness, the real people who know what the problems are, and what needs to be changed.It's simply not good enough to send professionals, who have no real idea what it's like to live with dementia.",

My electrical exam papers, which I still have in a folder, mean nothing atall to me, it's like trying to read in a foreign languageI once rewired the College Chapel,yet now I struggle to fit a 13 amp plug, but that's life. I also used to run two budgets, butended up counting in my fingers,which was distressing at the time. I sometimes feel embarrassed when Ineed to rely on other people, but never ashamed. I just have to admit it andmove on.Do people with an illness likeCancer feel ashamed these days?I know in the 1950-60s people were sometimesashamed of speaking about it, but things have moved on these days.There has been a lot in the pressabout people being ashamed of having dementia, but I do wonder when thinkingabout it now, whether the press are using this as head line grabbing, ratherthan putting out the true picture, of life with dementia.I do feel that while the press canbe helpful, some of them just use an illness like dementia to sell papers andscare us all etc, rather than be helpful to us.There may be a lot of elderlypeople who are ashamed of having dementia, but perhaps these people rememberthe old stories, and I feel very sad for them. Some of these stories make mecringe with horror, but we are all so very different, with different symptomsand problems, and no two people go the same way.I know that I was totally shockedto get the diagnosis, at the age of 56, simply because I had only ever heard ofSenile Dementia, and confess that Lewy Body Dementia sounded weird to say theleast.At this time I had never heard ofanyone like myself getting this illness, where these days people are beingdiagnosed earlier than I was, some in their thirties and perhaps younger.Then my consultant explained thatthere was various types of the illness, some of which had causes like strokes etc.,where others were unknownI was worried at the diagnosis, asI had no real idea what was going to happen to me, but part of me wasdetermined to carry on, as if the diagnosis had never happened.I had a brilliant consultant whoencouraged me to carry on, and enjoy each day as it comes, and never try to dothe things which have become impossible to do anymore, as that would bestressful.But she said I should try newthings, if I was up to it.From this point I never reallylooked back, because I went on to give talks about living well with theillness, and that was something that would have been impossible while I wasworking.The mere thought of standingup in committees in the University shook me with fear, now I take it in mystride, perhaps because I am determined to fight this illness and the stigma,we hear so much of these days.As I said I am certainly notashamed of having the illness, as I have done nothing at all to get it, or assome people think \"catch it\", because it's not contagious.So why should I be ashamed.Its comments like \"shame\"where we lose friends, because they feel ashamed to be around us, and in thatcase I feel shocked and ashamed of these people, because they have no idea, ofthe stress they have caused.Many of these were academics of onesort or another, and that made me very angry, and ashamed to have anything todo with them, because in my view they should have known better.But I guess that's how many of themodern day University Academics think these days, when they work in the largewell know Universities.However some families haveexperienced the same thing, from other family members, and that to me isdisgusting, and proves that they know nothing at all about the illness.It's not that we have done anythingto catch this illness, but I personally feel that people who use words likeshame, when talking about any form of dementia, are treating it like a dirtydisease picked up on the back streets, something we know is totally wrong.Other people may feel that, butthis is all part of the stigma we see and hear of every day.I know that there are some peoplewho may well be ashamed of the illness, and refuse to talk about it, or admitthat they have it, when it comes to friends and family.But I have always been quiteopen about it, because as my consultant said at the start, it's nothing to beashamed of, it's just a disease of the brainLike it or not many others havediseases of the brain, which are accepted like Parkinson's etc., so why not anyform of dementia.Never be ashamed of this illness,which ever form it may be.If you are diagnosed early enough,go out and try to enjoy your life while you can, take each day as it comes, andnever get upset at not being able to do the things you have done for years, asthat will only make things much worse.I am no angel, because I know whenthings go wrong, I sometimes get upset, annoyed and occasionally curse theillness, but I am certainly not ashamed to say that I have Lewy Body DementiaThrough this illness I have beenable to speak to thousands of people all over the UK, and these days I spendtime talking to graduate nurses in Universities about the illness.So does that sound like someone whois ashamed of having dementia, far from it?",

This also allows our carers to get on with other things without having to check whether we have done things for ourselves.However there are pitfalls in this, if I am away from home, in a hotel, or staying with the family as some of this changes.Things also go wrong if something like the door bell or telephone ring, then I forget where I got to, which can be stressful at timesOne day I went to have a shave, and someone telephoned our home so I had to answer as my wife was busy.It was a few hours later when we were out shopping that I realised that I had shaved one side of my face, and missed the other when the telephone rang. That felt very embarrassing and I felt I had to get back home to shave the other side, even though my wife said that it was not as obvious as it felt.But these things happen when you have this illness.This has all been made much worse now, as I have extra things to take on board as I have problems with my hip and knee.I now have to do exercises, which takes around half an hour to deal with and this gets stressful.The reason being that it has to be done in stages, counting up to five, ten times at each stage.But the slightest noise, I forget where I am.This is the joy of living with this illness, and it proves that nothing is as easy as it seems.But we have to keep trying, because we want to retain our freedom for as long as we canAn active brain fights to remain active and alive.",

Yes we get prompts when we cannot remember parts of this test, but the person doing this looked a little bewildered when I asked what this proved.I was asked why I was questioning this as she did not seem to grasp why I was asking.In the end I said,it is in normal life we do not have the luxury of prompts to remember things, we either remember something or it's gone into the list of time.I think this made the lady wonder if I was trying to be awkward, but I am sure that somewhere along the line she must have realised, that like it or not it's a fact.We either remember what we are doing, or we forget, but like it or not my short term memory is rubbish at timesMy wife my be good, but she does not always know what I am thinking about, or trying to work out.I was told that this Addenbrookes test is to help assess people, which is fine, but please let us have tests which are meaningful to us, and not relying on prompts which need a yes or no answer.In all fairness, if we do not remember the answer, we should be allowed to say I don't know, rather than be made to take a guess.",

        "content": "The press can in many cases allow us to put our stories across and raise awareness, which can be helpful, as we must try to remove the stigma and bad stories one way or another.Many of us use the media in one way or another, to explain our stories of life with dementia, and we sometimes use the media in campaigns, raising awareness, writing books, or in magazines, and occassionally by blogging.In some cases we have a lot of control as to what is written, where in many others, it's all down to the reporter or the editor, who may well be out just to get a hard hitting story.I have had the benefit of both sides of this coin, and where the good reporter and editor write your story, so that it's what you have said, the bad one will rewrite it to get the bad side or negative side of dementia and sadly we see a lot of this these days.This to me proves that many simply use us to get a story, where others are genuinely interested in putting out a good positive story about dementia.I have met many reporters, from newspapers and television, and have been left staggered at times by the way they change a story round to get what they want, whether we find it good or badly put over.In one or two cases, I had asked to see a copy, before it was printed, so that I could ensure the story was correct. This came after a couple of very bad stories. But reading the copy before it goes to print does not guarantee, that it will go out the way you saw it.In two cases the story was rewritten by the editor, because they did not agree with my changes. That can be very hurtful and in some cases distressing. These days some television channels and newspapers have dedicated reporters who know how to deal with people living with a serious illness like dementia, and in many of these cases we end up with a story well worth reading, because it takes in your life and tries to put a good positive message over.These people normally go through everything prior to the interview, so that you know what the questions will be, and you also know that the answers you gave will not be changed, and this is the mark of a good press reporter.These days in the media we also see stories, about people who have died, or sadly taken their own lives because they could not cope with the illness, and I often wonder just how much of the story is true and how much is speculation.One which sticks in my mind is that of Robin Williams. Some reports said he was struggling with Parkinson's Disease, where over the last few days, they are trying to say that he was struggling with hallucinations within, Lewy Body Dementia.While many of us who have this form of the illness, can understand these problems. We also know that this makes life hard, if not difficult at times, not just for the person with the illness, but also family membersNo one knows at present which story is correct, and until the facts are out in the open they should never comment. Now however the press are speculating about this, and in doing so they are causing extra distress to Robins family and close friends.So this is the negative side of the media.While it is good to use the media we must ensure that they are high quality, know about dementia, and are prepared to go that extra mile to ensure the story is correct.Using the media can be very helpful in raising awareness of dementia, but we must make sure that the bad press are filtered out and not allowed to cover our stories.",

But this is something which always causes many concerns. However very few go on to abuse others, as the press's say. They memory is too hard to cope with, they would probably end up living in fear of ending their own lives first,But we hear of people's life stories these days, which take in the memories of happy times, etc, but somewhere along the line any bad memories will have a drastic effect on our lives and dreams, and perhaps haunt those effectedAs someone who has had many horrendous nights with nightmares, I feel very sorry for those who had bad things happen to them as children or teenagers.I have no idea what causes my own nightly horrors, but if someone struggles with abuse as a child, and ends up with dementia, my heart goes out to them.Then we get those in the later stages of the illness, who are abused by their carers or care home staff. They cannot fight back, and have no defence against the abusersThese days we are also getting all of the publicity on the media about the Jimmy Saville case, and this is hurting many people, even though the press, don't really care. Seeing this on prime time television each and every day must haunt many people with dementia or mental illness, even though they may well gave been the victims of abuse as children.Bless them all.",

When news of the scheme emerged last month, some condemned it as \"an ethical travesty\".More than 50 GPs, dementia experts and patients groups, led by Dr Martin Brunet, a GP from Guildford, have signed the letter to Simon Stevens, NHS chief executive, and Alistair Burns, National Clinical Lead for Dementia.In it, they say the scheme has \u201ccrossed a line that should never be crossed\u201d which could leave vulnerable patients fearing they are being given a devastating diagnosis simply so their GP can line his pockets.\u201cThe diagnostic process is unique in the doctor-patient relationship because the patient has to trust the doctor\u2019s judgement,\u201d they write.\u201cThere must, therefore, be absolute surety that the doctor has no other motivation than the patient\u2019s best interests when they make a diagnosis.\u201dThe doctors say that the difficulties of correctly diagnosing dementia, there is a \u201cvery real possibility\u201d of patients without the condition being wrongly labelled, because of the financial incentives for GPs.\u201cTo be given a diagnosis of dementia is challenging when the diagnosis is correct, but to receive such a label incorrectly can have truly tragic consequences,\u201d the doctors say.Dr Brunet told The Telegraph: \u201cWhat has really struck me is the strength of feeling not just from GPs but also from patients about this \u2013 there is really deep concern over this, especially about what it could do about the trust between doctor and patient.\u201dThe letter is also signed by Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, who said that it was wrong to \u201cput a bounty on the head\u201d of the vulnerable.The Cedars Practice in Deal, in Kent, has drawn up plans to send all funds they receive to a local dementia centre, in protest at the ethics of it. GPs in Buckingham are discussing similar ideas.Earlier this week, health officials announced plans to offer people aged between 40 and 74 screening for their risk of dementia, and tell them how their \"brain age\" compares to their biological age.Dr Martin McShane, National Clinical Director for people with long-term-conditions said: \u201cDementia is an absolutely devastating condition, and there are too many people undiagnosed who are being denied the care they need. As the population ages, we cannot tinker at the edges. We need to make a fundamental breakthrough, a step change.\"He added: \"Our aim is that every patient with dementia gets the best treatment and the right support as early as possible. To achieve this, we need both GPs and the public to be on the alert, spot the signs early and either seek help or get patients the help they need.\u201d* Experts are calling for new targets to reduce levels of antibiotic prescribing. A summit on antimicrobial resistance in London yesterday heard warnings that resistance to antibiotics has become \u201cone of the major health challenges of our age\u201d. Royal Colleges representing GPs, nurses, and public health doctors called for targets to reduce levels of antibiotics consumption - now rising by 6 per cent a year \u2013 to the levels reached in 2010.",

        "content": "We were invited to speak at the North East regional conference of the Samaritans yesterday, my wife as a carer and me talking about living well with dementia.This was a very thought provoking day, because as a person with dementia, who at times sees my own problems with depression in dementia, mild though it may be, I realised just how difficult it is to carry on without the right support.As I have said before, many including the professionals, refuse to accept let alone talk about depression in dementia, and the first thing a doctor will do is, think of anti depressants, rather than look at the real cause behind it.Hearing many stories today I realised that we walk a tight rope, and need to be very careful, and seek help when needed.I know that many of our problems are caused by the fact that we are loosing control of many things in our lives, but many people simply do not understand this.When we started today there was a presentation, which included all of the charities who link up with the Samaritans, but there was no mention of Parkinson's disease and no Alzheimer's Society involved, which really made me wonder.Depression plays a big part of dementia, so where do we go for support, and what do we look out for.Years ago the Alzheimer's Society used to have support groups for both carers and people with Dementia, but these were done away with in the re organisations, and left with dementia cafe's and singing for the brain. When what we really need at the time, is someone to sit and talk to face to face it needs be.They also started up a group which was going to be called Dementia mentors, a service where a carer or person with the illness, could ring a number on a night and get support from someone else who has the illness or was caring for someone with the illness. But this was then scraped before if could get off the ground.This service was badly needed as you cannot always get good advise from Internet chat rooms, as many people think that we are all the same, with the same problems ans symptoms, something we know is rubbish these days, as there are well over 120 variations of this illness.But a quiet chat over the telephone would work wonders for people at times, rather than being hung out to dry by charities and professionals This would have been an ideal group to support those in need, a friendly voice at the end of the telephone, so you could get answers to questions when the hospital clinics were closed.I often wonder how many desperate people went on to ring the Samaritans because they got no response from anyone else.Yes many charities have call centres but these are largely people working from sheets of paper and ticking boxes, they do not live with the illness, or care for someone with the illness, a very big mistake, as they have no hands in experience.One or two of us may be very lucky that we may live near to a hospital specialising in dementia, where we could get support at night if things go wrong, but not everyone has this in their local area.The hospital near to us has dementia wards, which I gather are manned 24/7 so perhaps we are very lucky with this.Graphic nightmares and hallucinations are one of the major concerns in dementia as many feel that they are going mad.But how many doctors and consultants discuss this problem at the point if diagnosis, many people find out the hard waySo my advice to anyone who is struggling with depression through dementia etc, is to call the Samaritans which is manned 24/7 and get advise before it's too late.Remember your not alone with this illness, even if you have no family or friends around you.",

I heard this and just looked in amazement. In the end my wife told me to walk away, before I got into trouble.Your balance is wonderful when it works as if should, but when you lose it, you get a real shock, simply because you take it for granted without even thinking about itThis also affects me in meetings when people move around fast, or dodge you to get past. This is because you feel as if you are going to fall over.These days we spend time discussing respect in dementia, yet I do feel that if people cannot respect the disabled, how on earth are people going to respect those with dementia.I think we will get there at some stage but it may well take a lot longer than we expect",

But I also know that others must feel the same way.So if I stop going now I may well fail others.Sometimes professionals use big words, or medical jargon which means nothing to me these days, an I know that I am not alone. When I was working I used many big wors, which no longer gave a meaning to me these days.We must try to change others attitudes towards us , and get the professions to be move respective than they are nowI live in hope that some day things will change, and we will be there for our expert views, and not be used simply to tick boxes.So if you are hosting meetings with people who have dementia, please allow us time to think and answer before moving on, and do not assume that you know better, because it's only when you live with this illness that you really understand the problems.Treat us with the same dignity and respect, that you take for granted",

So if it needed checking surely that should have been done before it left the NHS delivery point.I was told that I could not use the hospital stick supplied as no one had checked itSo unless my legs are longer or shorter that they were when I got the hospital stick, I simply do not understand what all of the fuss is about today.Perhaps we will get an answer very soon.Is this why the NHS has problems these days, when even one department cannot get things right",

It's also been attached to Aids, and recently Ebola, yet much of it is caused by old stories and myths, which do not seem to go away, possibly because many people simply believe they are true.I have been asked on many occasions whether dementia us contagious, something which has left me staggered. Some think you can catch it if someone who has dementia sneezes.But I believe much of this stems from the fact that it sometimes seems to run in families, but most of it seems to come from the fact the some forms are called disease, like Lewy Body Dementia, which in some cases is called Lewy Body Disease, just one case in many.Some charities sometimes call themselves \" Alzheimer's Disease or Dementia Disease, and this also helps keep the stigma going. This is because professionals cannot decide what to call illnesses I suppose, or people call things by different terms and namesBut I feel that much of this could be stopped, if everyone was educated properly about this illness, rather than picking up odd pieces and trying to find the truth their own wayTo educate everyone we should be starting with school children, who are already learning about someone in their families who has the illness. Many of these children want to learn more about what is happening to granny or grand dad, and it's now time to start helping them understand just what is going on.These are the people who will shape the future in stopping this stigma, and therefore we must help them to help us.Years ago parents kept their children out of the way, when someone had dementia, but now things have changed for the best, and it would be much better without the stigma.I have also heard stories of people crossing the road, so they did not come into contact with someone who had dementia in their families.This usually happened in very close communities like small villages, as a family member once told me.So it's time to find a way of getting into all schools, to teach all children that stigma, is not a nice thing, no matter which illness it's attached to. Teachers should allow people with illnesses into schools to help educate those who are our future support.The Government says that they are dementia friendly, so it's time they factored this into education.It does not need to be an examination study, just allow us in during free time to speak to children and explain our problems and the stigma which is attached to it.Let us hope that sometime soon things will change and change for the bestLet us all work to remove all stigma once and for all",

The Government is urging GPs to improve their detection rates over concerns that victims and their families are struggling in silence.But part of the problem is that many patients are too afraid to be diagnosed so do not make an appointment in the first place.Professor Hugh Perry, chairman of the neuroscience and mental health board at the MRC, said: \u2018The embarrassment and shame of having a disease associated with both age and mental health is a real barrier to people seeking the help they need.\u2018A long time ago there was a stigma attached to cancer and more recently HIV. In both cases it stopped people from getting treatment and that\u2019s sadly the case with dementia.\u2019The report is based on in-depth interviews of patients with dementia, their relatives, specialist doctors and academics.'PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO KNOW'Sylvia Kahn, 77, a retired solicitor, was diagnosed with dementia three years ago.She said that since then people \u2018don\u2019t want to know\u2019 and often \u2018turn away\u2019.The grandmother, who lives with her husband Bob in Warrington, Cheshire, said: \u2018Those of us with Alzheimer\u2019s are often deeply hurt when people are afraid to talk to us.\u2018Why should you stigmatise us? We didn\u2019t ask for the dementia. It\u2019s not a crime.\u2019Mrs Kahn decided to leave her job after being diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s following a series of memory scans in 2011.With her husband she now works for the Alzheimer\u2019s Society giving talks and helping raise funding for the research.It describes how patients\u2019 friends and close relatives often distance themselves and don\u2019t \u2018dare ask\u2019 how they are. In some cases, the report warns that patients\u2019 own children stop visiting them because the deterioration is \u2018too hard to watch\u2019.And it also cites figures from a study in 2012 involving 157 dementia patients which found one in four had tried to hide their symptoms from family and friends.George McNamara, head of policy and public affairs at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, which was also involved in the report said: \u2018We\u2019ve come a long way in terms of raising awareness but we still need to do more as a society to banish the stigma surrounding dementia once and for all.\u2019In a forward to the report, Professor Alistair Burns, a Department of Health expert on dementia and Baroness Sally Greengross, chairman of the All-Parliamentary Group on dementia, write: \u2018We still have much to understand about why dementia remains outside the realm of acceptable conversation.\u2019Early symptoms of dementia include loss of memory, difficulties concentrating, depression and confusion. Certain drugs including donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine can temporarily halt the decline but only if given in the early stages.Last year David Cameron pledged to make dementia a national priority and said there would be a cure by 2025. The Government has also promised that by next year doctors will have diagnosed two thirds of all patients with the illness.Recent estimates show diagnosis is as low as 45 per cent and in some areas as low as one in seven.Last week it emerged NHS officials were planning to pay GPs \u00a355 for every new patient diagnosed with dementia between now and March.A Department of Health spokesman said: \u2018Real change is needed, that\u2019s why we are working with the Alzheimer\u2019s Society and Public Health England to help tackle stigma and increase understanding.\u2019",

Some family members refuse to accept the diagnosis, and this had a knock on effect.But if we get support from people who mean a lot to us then the sky is the limit.However we must also try these days to get support from doctors, nurses, social workers and everyone else in the health and public services. This is taking a very long time and is hit and miss at times, a post code lottery that many in government circles deny, but whether they like it or not it does exist.This should also take in people like physiotherapists and occupational therapists, who give us a lot of support. I will however say that some of these people do not understand dementia as well as we would expect.I did however have an assessment with a physiotherapist a week ago, and was staggered when a young lady walked into the room, because she looked as if she should have been in school, but she was brilliant, and very helpfulMy wife said later that It is because I am getting old and this makes nursing staff etc look so much younger.Many universities are training nurses to understand dementia and that is a brilliant start, but we also need doctors and consultants to start understanding our problems.I am honoured and privileged to work with Northumbria University, where I talk to graduate nurses on a regular basis, and I am thrilled at their standard of nursing training, and dementia work they are doing.The other day I heard about a consultant who would not listen to a carer, because she was not his patient, I have to ask what planet this person came from in this day and age.I think we should also take on board that one person with dementia, is not the same as norther person with the illness. There are so many variations of this illness, that no two people, even two with the same type of dementia are the same. We are all individuals, with totally individual symptoms and problemsLet us hope that before long dementia training will be given to all staff in the public and health sector, so we are treated with dignity and respect, the same dignity and respect that others demand and expect as their right",

A quarter of patients in district general hospital beds in Wales have dementia as one of their conditions. \"It's a challenge that's going to get even bigger if we don't do something about it,\" Prof Anthony Bayer told BBC Wales' Week in Week Out.Ministers admit a \"new push\" is needed on how dementia services are developed.A recent audit of the NHS Memory Services in Wales by Prof Bayer compared the amount of money spent on patients in Wales with those in England. It found that on average, memory clinics in England spend twice as much on staff for each new patient as they do in Wales. Wales also had the worst diagnosis rates in the UK.Prof Bayer told the programme: \"Currently, there are about 45,000 people with dementia in Wales and that is due to rise by 1 or 2% year on year so the numbers are rising exponentially. \"The real problem is that still less than half of those patients are even diagnosed.\" Many patients in hospital with dementia will have other ailments too which could be treated in the community. Some have dementia alone, but are waiting for care to be in place before they can be discharged.   Chris Roberts has dementia at a younger age CASE STUDY - Chris Roberts, 53, from Denbighshire, has dementia while his wife Jayne is also dealing with her mother's dementia. \"The biggest reaction I get at my age talking about it [having dementia] is disbelief. \"People don't want to believe it themselves because they would be admitting they could also get an illness that could lead to dementia - I wish I could disbelieve it.\" Prof Bayer said that lack of support means too many patients are ending up in hospital.\"One in four people in district general hospital beds have dementia,\" said Prof Bayer. \"If you actually shifted more resource into the community then you could stop a lot of these unnecessary admissions.\"And if people did go into hospital you could get them home much more quickly.\" He added: \"If we don't do anything then the whole system is going to grind to a halt.\"Health Minister Mark Drakeford acknowledged diagnosis rates were not going up fast enough.

I had seen a physio once, but he took no notice of my memory problems at all, and also refused my wife access so that she could help me to remember the exercises.However as I was struggling with my balance, my consultant at the i hospital had arranged some physio exercises which I can do at home, all of which are written out on sheets of paper with diagrammes where needed.Yesterday I was refered back to our local hospital for another physiotherapy assessment, where I was staggered to see a young lady who looked so young to me, she did not look old enough to to the job.Yet she took the time to understand my problems and was so helpful.

My wife had pointed out that she wondered if my problems were due to gait a problem in dementia and she said that each person with dementia was vastly different to the next.She said the exercises I was doing were very helpful, but gave me a few more to strengthen my back.This was a vast difference from the original consultant, who asked if I wanted a hip replacement, yet knew nothing at all about dementia.On Monday I have an MRI scan where it is hoped to get the full damage to both joints, but it sounds as if it is osteoarthritis and muscle weakness, so I just have to get on with it.I long for the day when all NHS staff are trained in dementia and memory problems like this young lady.",

We should also remember that many people who have this illness do not make friends very easily as they may be nervous or simply don't know who they can trust.There are many people out there who may well have hobbies, but may need assistance or support, and this could be ideal, if say someone like photography and needed help occasionally.If there was a volunteer with the experience in this subject, they could be a real asset to the person with dementia.It could be that they simply need someone to call in at home and have a chat or give advice.There are many people with dementia, who use the internet, but feel that talking face to face with someone makes that extra bit of difference.I really hope that this takes off, and we see it being rolled out to the rest of the country.Who knows, but in the future we may also see the discussion groups being brought back, where people with dementia, could go and discuss anything from dementia problems, to local history.Perhaps now things are starting to change for the best.",

The Scottish Dementia Working Group wrote a Joke book a few years ago, and thejokes were provided by the members of the group. I bought a copy of this which was signed by some of my friends in the Working GroupA few months later we were flooded at home and had to move out into a flat for about six months, something I really did not enjoy at all, as we had lost so many of or personal possessions But this book was my life line at the time. Why am I laughing , a classic collection of short jokes for all of the familySadly I lost it when we returned home, so I bought a new copy. Its not the same as the original was signed and meant so much to me,but I still enjoy reading it.I often read this book just to have a good laugh because life can be so very serious, and this can get you depressed if you are not carefulAfter a while you can tell exactly which person was telling the jokes without looking at the book.But I guess that is because I knew all of those people.I remember one member of the Alzheimer's Society's Living with Dementia Working Group, when it was still going a few years ago, and he could sit and tell jokes all night. My problem was and still is that I could not remember the punch lines, or the jokes would return in themiddle of the night, so I would start laughing and then wake my wife upI always loved telling funny stories, but my wife got to the stage when she could not tell when I was being seriousA few years ago we were on a long train journey, and for some reason the train stopped in the middle of nowhere. When it started running again it was very wobbly and bouncing along the track. My wife looked at me, and for some reason I just said. I think the trains got a flat tyre?After a few moments of quiet she looked at me, and told me off. I did tell her a few months ago that trains do indeed have a tyre fitted over their wheels, and she would not believe me, until our Son in Law explained it to her, and even then I think she was convinced that he was pulling her legSo now I have to be careful what I sayAt one stage in life I could see the funny side of anything, and this got me into trouble on a few occasions, but I am not sure whether that was the start of this illness.Life is too serious these days so we must enjoy ourselves, and where possible have a good laugh as it does help us feel much betterBut my moto is enjoy life as it comes",

Can you imagine how distressing it would be if you can\u2019t find your way home?\u201dPrivate healthcare company Bupa was its first client, and is now joined by providers and NHS trusts around the country. The company has also had interest from Germany, Australia, the US and Canada.Find developed the signage range based on evidence of how people change their behaviour due to deteriorating physical and mental ability.Mr Rose said: \u201cFor many people as they age, one of their biggest fears is falling over things, which means they focus more on the ground. We position signs quite low so they are within their field of vision.\u201cReading becomes an issue, colour becomes an issue and reflections can be challenging. To address that, all signage is non-reflective, words are written in a particular typeface, colours are high contrast and there are high-quality pictures to help people who have lost the ability to read at all.\u201dCustomer feedback is key in product development, Mr Rose said.\u201cOur customers really are our greatest asset, they bring a wealth of information,\u201d Mr Rose said.\u201cThey tell us they are dealing with a certain problem and ask if we can develop something to address it.\u201dIn addition to its signage products, Find has developed a crockery range and specialist clocks.It has also created a range of traditional red phoneboxes that accommodate wheelchair users, as well as bringing much-needed familiarity to the setting.Activity items that stimulate conversation in a non-confrontational way and enable dementia users with communication problems to interact with carers are also in development.In 2011, the company received finance from White Ghost director Anthony Cockroft, which enabled it to \u201creally start to make headway\u201d, Mr Rose said. The items save \u201ccollosal amounts of money\u201d for homes and the NHS by allowing people to live more independently, he said.\u201cIt is a lovely, very meaningful thing to be involved in,\u201d he added.",

A RETIRED teacher has compiled a booklet to help those who support people with mental illness.Hartlepool woman Liz Fletcher has put together a 12-page leaflet called Caring For People With Dementia.The free booklet, which has been sponsored by the town\u2019s Wharton Annexe, offers help and advice for carers of people who have suffered from dementia and memory loss.Liz, who taught at the town\u2019s King Oswy and then Henry Smith School, and also High Tunstall \u2028School, said the book is in \u201csimple language\u201d and \u2028helps signpost them to services.She said the inspiration behind the book was \u201ctriggered by personal loss\u201d after she witnessed first-hand the effects of dementia, as her mum passed away after a five-year battle with the illness.Liz had also visited people in care homes suffering from the condition.It offers simple advice, including to buy a replacement key and to keep it safe, to stop dementia sufferers from wandering the streets at night.She said: \u201cMany years ago my mother died from dementia.\u2028\u201cMy father decided he was going to keep her at home.\u201cI saw the effect it had on him.\u201cDuring the day, when there were lots of people around, it wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201cBut it\u2019s at night, when they have to close the door and lock it.\u201cThey have got to keep the key with them as sufferers of memory loss can find the key and end up wandering the streets.\u201cIt\u2019s about keeping the sufferer safe.\u201cI wanted to alleviate things a bit with some ideas, and also signpost them to services to show they are not alone.\u201dLiz thanked Hartlepool Healthwatch members, Gretton Court, and Atkinson Print for their support in producing the leaflet.The book was launched during an event at Wharton Annexe to mark International Day of the Older Person.This included a coffee morning, tombola, and stalls ran by Hartlepool Carers, Hartlepool Healthwatch and Greatham Hospital of God, as well as refreshments.Teresa Driver, youth and community co-ordinator at the Annexe, said around 50 people attended and added that it was a good way to promote the booklet.The event also raised funds for a trip for the young people of the Annexe.The book is available from Hartlepool Voluntary \u2028Development Agency (HVDA), and there are plans to make \u2028it available in doctor\u2019s \u2028surgeries.",

        "content": "From todays news pressHow painting, puzzles or a trip to the park can slow down dementiaKEEPING the brain active can help maintain relationships and improve mental function, says Dr Lee-Fay Low                                     Games and puzzles are a great way to stimulate the brain and maintain levels of interaction [GETTY]What do you do that gives your brain a workout? I find travelling, attending a course, workshop or conference, organising an event or performing on stage all work my brain. What these activities have in common is they require me to process and react to a lot of new information.But dementia sufferers often find it difficult to cope with a lot of new information. Many would find it challenging, although not necessarily impossible, to travel, learn something new or go to a crowded event. This is why they are advised to keep to a routine and avoid potentially overstimulating experiences. However there is a downside to sticking to a routine. Routines tend to reduce opportunities to give their brain a workout which is why we should aspire to create a stimulating routine for people with dementia.Two 45-minute sessions a week is the 'dose' that has been shown to be beneficial in improving cognitive function for people with dementia. Trying a range of activities will help exercise different aspects of thinking and memory. Here are some ideas for stimulating activities: Start a discussionThis activity is more appropriate for people with mild to moderate dementia. Discussions should not just tap into the person's knowledge about the topic but also their opinions and ideas. Activities could include solving a problem by using a map to plan a long-distance trip, for example. Or you could ask them to arrange three historical events on chronological order. In this type of exercise you are asking them to use knowledge they already have in the activity. You could initiate discussions on topics such as the person's own life, historical events (you could use the Daily Express historic editions as inspiration), famous faces, current events, geography and places.Do something artisticPeople with dementia often surprise us with what they can create when given the opportunity. Perhaps it is because they are less inhibited due to changes in their frontal lobes or because they live in the moment much more than those with better memories. Artists say having a theme or focus stimulates their creativity. Give the person some materials (paper and pens, paints or modelling clay) and a theme to work on and see what they can come up with. Suggestions for themes could include: 'If you had three wishes what would they be', 'A day on the river', or 'Fruit'. You could get the person to observe something in real life and draw it such as a landscape or still life. Play a game or do a puzzleChoose games on the basis that they are fun and encourage interaction rather than because they are mentally challenging. Try and avoid games that rely heavily on short-term memory. Don't be competitive unless the person with dementia wants to be competitive. You can also turn games traditionally played competitively or alone into a collaborative exercise. For instance work together on a simple crossword or jigsaw puzzle. Many children's games are also fun for people with dementia. Here are some ideas for traditional games: snap, pick up sticks, Connect four, magnetic fishing games, dominoes, noughts and crosses, picture bingo or scrabble.Experience natureDo something that connects the person with the outside world. Being outdoors releases different chemicals in the brain than when indoors and can improve stress levels and increase creativity. Here are some ideas for outings:\u2022 Go for a walk and look for birds or other animals\u2022 Pat and interact with an animal\u2022 Feed the ducks at the local park\u2022 Look at the clouds and try to find animal shapes\u2022 Watch moving water\u2022 Go outside and look for objects of a certain colour\u2022 Collect objects (rocks, leaves, sticks flowers or shells) and arrange them in some way in the house to remind you of the experienceDiscuss dilemmasThis activity works better with people with some verbal communication ability as it relies on the person with dementia giving their opinion on any given topic. However you could also use pictures for someone who is unable to speak well. Topics could be:\u2022 Is a cat or a dog a better pet?\u2022 What kind of dog should I get as a pet?\u2022 What is a good present for a child/60-year-old?\u2022 Should I go on holiday to the beach or the mountains?",

If you get stuck you are given prompts, and no matter whether have forgotten the answer or not you have to pick one answer.This always gets me because I cannot remember things like this.If you are lucky enough to pick the right answer by sheer fluke you get a good mark, but what does this prove, if at the end of the day it is a guess and nothing else.But what is the point of giving us prompts, if we do not remember the answer anyway. We do not get prompts in daily life, we have to struggle on trying to remember things without support.In my job I had many exams which were sometimes multi choice, similar to this in many ways, but you either passed or failed.You had to know the correct answer and nothing else.There are many times in life where you hear something, then in a few moments it's all gone, so can someone please tell me what thus achieves as many people with dementia have said that they feel the test is very upsetting and does not prove anything to them.I go from day to day trying to get on with my life, with my memory problems, no one can prompt me because they simply do not know what I was trying to think through.There are times when I think of my short term memory problems, I do wonder if there is something else causing this or if it's a mixed type of dementia.That is something for the consultant to decide when I go back again in the future.",

I ended up enjoying the experience , although I am not a fanof modern art work. Although many people who have dementia love to paint anddraw, there are times when it becomes difficult to get the picture right,especially if it is down to look like a scene outside. I often give up in totalfrustration because it never looks the same but I guess this is all down to thespacial awareness side of things, where everything looks so very different inour eyes from day to day. I used to love drawing when I was younger, and I thinklooking back this makes life so much harder as all this has gone.It is difficult to get distances right and sometimesangles, yet as an engineer I would sketch or draw out things that were neededand then go back to the office knowing full well that I had an accurate drawingof what was needed, but now that the brain has changed all of this is all butin the past.These days I struggle with the colours, getting the rightshade or at least working out how to mix the correct shade of a certain colour,but I guess its all trial and error, but there are extra problems when it comesto how certain colours were mixed before.

Picture: PAOur significant experience is helping, says Allan LoganAt CrossReach, we support people across Scotland who are dealing with the effects of dementia.  Since opening Scotland\u2019s first specialist care home for people with dementia in 1983 \u2013 Williamwood House in Glasgow \u2013 we have seen huge changes in the way society relates to the condition. We now understand that, while it is a devastating illness, dementia is not the end. A diagnosis must not signal the end to anyone\u2019s participation in their community, or to their opportunities to live a fulfilling life. Key to this is overcoming the prejudices and misconceptions that still exist about dementia, and helping people who have not witnessed the condition first hand to understand the impact it has on people in their communities.  Achieving this does not have to be complicated, and does not have to be led by public policy initiatives. CrossReach\u2019s Cameron House in Inverness has recently struck up a partnership with their local Gaelic primary school. Pupils meet regularly with Gaelic-speaking residents to improve their language skills and hear about the lives of those from a different generation.  They learn that dementia does not stop people from enjoying life and sharing their skills and experience with others.According to Alzheimer Scotland, it is estimated that 86,000 people in this country live with dementia, but only half of our fellow citizens who have the condition get a formal diagnosis. Figures published last week show we have been seriously underestimating levels of dementia in younger people \u2013 it had been thought around 3,000 people younger than 65 were affected, in reality it may be as much as twice that.Despite phenomenal efforts by colleagues in the field of medicine, dementia is still not fully understood, and so no cure is available. A great deal of fear, as well as stigma, still surrounds the condition because of how distressing it can be to witness a loved one\u2019s experience of the disease. The Scottish Social Services Council, our regulatory body, is developing ambassadors for care to improve the support people receive across our sector.  At CrossReach, our dementia development officers have worked to ensure that we are the first organisation in the country to have a dementia ambassador at all of our services for older people. The dementia ambassadors take responsibility for promoting good practice and sharing their learning about dementia with colleagues, people we support, and family members. As understanding of the disease continues to develop, our ambassadors will be essential to ensuring the support we offer remains at the cutting edge.As the Social Care Council of the Church of Scotland, CrossReach\u2019s work is built upon the church\u2019s long tradition of providing support, since 1869.  Throughout our history, we have pioneered new approaches in social care and our services have developed according to the needs of the communities we support. We work with people of all ages, but it is our services for older people in particular which have been required to place greater emphasis on dementia \u2013 and its impact on our communities \u2013 in recent years. We have eight care homes which were set up to provide enhanced support for people with dementia, but today all 30 of our older people\u2019s services support a significant number of people who are dealing with the condition. This experience led us to develop Heart for Art, our creative arts project which operates in five communities across Scotland.  Creative arts enable people to express themselves, and Heart for Art provides a place in the community where making artwork is the focus, but where people can also easily access support and advice. The paintings and other works that are the result of Heart for Art give us a tangible way to prove that dementia is not the end of people\u2019s enjoyment of life.However, dealing with dementia is not just a job for professionals in social care. We must all be willing to have our preconceptions of the illness challenged. People experiencing the effects of dementia remain active members of our communities, with a voice and a contribution to make. As their fellow citizens, our job is to ensure people who live with dementia have, along with the rest of society, the chance to live positive and fulfilling lives.",

        "content": "I have heard it is said, that the numbers of people going to the Samaritans these days with dementia related illnesses is on the rise. I was in one way surprised by this, until I looked at the possible reasonsDiagnosis of dementia is not something that anyone wants, because its like being diagnosed with inoperable cancer, its an illness with no known cure.When you are given this diagnosis you may well find that you are not given any support or help, and therefore you may well become desperate. Many have said that the diagnosis of dementia is like a death knell, and many carers etc, start grieving from then onwards.This may also be the case for anyone who does not have family support, or indeed good friends around them.But hidden inside this illness is depression, something that many consultants do not mention, or if they do they imply, that you are simply depressed and do not have dementia.When I was diagnosed I was told I was simply stressed, then after 10 weeks that changed to depression, something my wife and I knew was wrong, so my wife demanded a second opinion from a consultant and the rest is historyI was enjoying my job, I just kept forgetting to do things and forgot peoples names which was upsettingI got a lot of support from my consultant and was then told to go to our local Alzheimer's Society branch office were we would get more support and help to see us through.This is something we never hear about these days, because many of these local offices and support services have been closed down, so in many cases people are left to find their own support.There are also those who perhaps do not accept that they have the illness in the first place, and this is hard to understand, because if you cannot accept the diagnosis you will never be able to move on and get on with life. Sometimes its the family's who refuse to accept the diagnosis and that puts extra pressure on those who have the illness, or there are family rows about how to deal with the person and in many cases the person with the illness starts to feel worthless and uselessThere are many who lose control of their lives and feel useless or worthless, because like me they may well have lost their jobs through the illness. I can understand people feeling like this because you cannot get to grips with losing your role in life.However the depression in dementia, it seems is caused because we are losing control over our lives, and rather than trying to move away from the things which are difficult we may keep fighting.My consultant told me at the start, that things would become difficult, andsome of the things I have done for years may well become impossible to do, simply because the brain has forgotten how to do these jobs.This consultant said, if you cannot do something one day, then leave and try on another day.If it fails again on the second go, leave it until another dayIf it fails on the third attempt, leave well alone and try to move on, because by trying to do the impossible, you will only get very stressed and upset and make yourself worse.This advice always stayed with me, and although I still get upset when things go wrong, I know that I have to move on.So where do we go from here. I do feel that as I said before, we need more dementia groups in every locality, where people can go for advice and support, we cannot rely on the internet, even if you can use a computer in the first place. Face to face advice and support is always the best.If you have local groups, you become friendly with people and discuss your problems, with others, even though your problems may be different to someone else, simply because there are so many variations of dementia, and no two people have the same symptoms and problemsIf you get into a period when you feel depressed try to speak to someone, get it off your chest, do not sit and stew on it because that will only make it worseBut I guess after all of this it comes down to getting a formal diagnosis in the first place, followed by good support from the Consultant, followed by support from family and friends to help us steer clear of depression if possible.I do feel that consultants and doctors should be more aware of depression in dementia and should explain it to patients after or during thediagnosis However never forget that there are people out there who you can speak to for support, people like the Samaritans, all volunteers, and they will try to support you through the rough times.",

This is because you cannot think of any questions at the diagnosis, and they only come to you when your back home, trying to work it all out in your mind.This is when many people come off the rails so to speak, because they become desperateand depressed, and without support you feel as if your world is coming to an end.I was extremely lucky to have a wife and daughter who were very supportive and did not allow me to dwell on what may happen. My daughter who is a biologist explained quite a lot at the time, and she still helps me understand things these days But for others things may be different, depending on whether you have support at home, or friends near by who can support youThere are many online chat rooms where you can get help, many of which operate 24 hours a day, but that depends on one fact,you need a computer, and like it or not many people do not have them these days.Yet there are opportunities out there if you get the support and know where to lookThere are many charities dealing with dementia who give some support, but getting good local support these days is very hit and missThere are also many new independent dementia groups being set up around the UK and they are filling in many of the gaps left by the closure of Alzheimer's Disease Offices and support groups.Many of these places have support staff who can come out to see you and give you the advise you may well need.Many people say that they would rather have a face to face chat with someone than discussing problems on the computer, and in many cases I would agree.If you are lucky enough to get support and get involved with a good charity, you may well be invited to be a spokesman in the media, or you may be invited to be a speaker at events. If its what you would like to do., there are always opportunities. Speaking about your problems, not only allows others to understand what you are going through, but it also helps you to understand the illness yourself and come to terms with it I confess that the thought of doing this before the illness, was something I would never even consider, yet I took to it after a while and never looked back.Other people take this a step further by working with Alzheimer's Disease International, or in Europe where they have committees working on dementia projects. Because I dropped out of the charity work for a while I was never invited to join these groups, because you need to be sponsored by the charity.

Photograph: Colin Underhill/Alamy                                     I get up around 6:30, check emails and attempt to raise my 10-year-old daughter in time for school while grabbing something vaguely healthy for breakfast. Then I head to whichever care home I\u2019m working in that day.I work with the charity Age Exchange as a reminiscence arts practitioner \u2013 running projects with both active and frail older people in care settings. Reminiscence arts is a unique way for artists, therapists and practitioners to work with older people, particularly those with dementia, to evoke and inspire their memories and imaginations. We use techniques derived from dance, visual arts, drama, literature and music to learn about people, help them communicate and build new relationships, despite the challenges dementia can pose.Practitioners come from many walks of life: visual artists, musicians, actors, occupational therapists, arts therapists and social workers. I\u2019ve worked in theatre, education, community arts and inter-generational projects. I\u2019m currently focusing on a research project for Age Exchange, exploring how reminiscence arts improve the wellbeing of people with dementia.When I arrive at the care home I go to the person\u2019s room for a one-to-one session. They can be very frail and have difficulty communicating. I try to connect with them by introducing myself, smiling and perhaps holding their hand. I\u2019ll play music or bring something from our memory boxes. The smell of an old brand of soap, photograph or war object can help trigger a memory that the person might be able to tell me about, or articulate using their body language.In the afternoon I\u2019ll often run a group session with my fellow practitioner, Susan. These involve six to eight people chosen by the care home, and two care staff to provide support. Susan and I prepare the session together, either basing it on what people have enjoyed previously, or using a set theme, such as holidays, a local landmark or an anniversary. We\u2019ll use sensory objects \u2013 even a colourful silk scarf may evoke a memory when gently skimmed over peoples\u2019 hands. I\u2019ve had some funny moments using costumes and hats in the past \u2013 giving a cap to one man immediately triggered his Norman Wisdom impression!Malcolm Jones: \u2018Our work at Age Exchange is based on compassion and a real desire to learn about people.\u2019                                             Photograph: PR                                     We find ways to encourage interaction within the group, such as throwing and bouncing balls of different sizes and textures. People make eye contact with the person they are about to throw the ball to, which helps them relax and begin to recognise each other. Susan is a visual artist, so sessions often include handicrafts, art or storytelling.Our group is currently working on a play about childhood and growing up, using rhymes and street games with lots of rhythm and familiar words. We\u2019re going to add stories about being naughty and happy, and about evocative tastes and smells. As people forget lines and words, plays like this have to be improvised each week. We have 15 sessions left in this project, so with prompts and music we\u2019ll be able to create something special to perform at the end.We finish with tea, biscuits and music. We\u2019ll chat or play instruments, clapping and moving to a lively song, before a 10-minute debrief with staff and each other.Our work at Age Exchange is based on compassion and a real desire to learn about people. We help them understand who they were and who they are, in whatever way possible. It\u2019s incredibly rewarding for everyone, including us practitioners. Care staff learn a lot by participating alongside residents, and we provide training on how to use reminiscence arts to build relationships with older people and find out about their life histories.On the drive home I often have to detach myself from the sadness I see during my work and focus on the fun and creativity instead. Dinner, a glass of wine with my partner and a bedtime story with my daughter bring the day to an end. She tells me about school and I think of some of the memories that were shared during my sessions. I\u2019m often left thinking about how closely all our lives are woven together.",

        "content": "I often think that the media should be morecareful about what they write or comment on when it comes to dementia and othermedical conditions.This is because they seem to have acavalier approach to any articles they write, and totally forget those withthese illnesses.In Dementia we are always hearing aboutmiracle cures, which then disappear completely.Surely before they write an article they should check it out with anotherresearch body, to see if it is what they claim.These claims only raise peoples hopes, and then leave them in the dark, whichis very wrong.We really do need more dementia friendlynews reporters, who understand that we get upset if they raise our hopes withthese miracle cures only to find that they are in many cases untrue, or so faroff that it will have little or no effect on those living with the illnessThe media also have weird ideas aboutinterviewing people with dementia, and still use the terms we all object tolike service user, which is also used for drug addicts. Or they say sufferer,another term whichgets many very upset, because sufferer means someone insevere pain etc.When they interview people with dementia they are so much of a hurry that theyask questions and then try to answer them for us which is totally disrespective. If they give us the chance to think the question through we cananswer for ourselves.Sometimes I have noticed they interviewers ask a lot of questions, andthen the editor changes everything to suit themselves so the story is totallydifferent to what was out over in the first place.But I think that this is because many media outlets only want their ownstories. I have had the pleasure to work with many over the years, yet the oneswho really cared and did dementia stories properly are usually local where theyare genuinely interested in the person, and not themselves.One such company is ITV Tyne Tees, who really look into the project firstbefore going head long into a long interview with too many questions. Theyusually use brilliant reporters, who know about the illness and spent timeputting you at ease before starting.Another local newspaper in the North East is the Northern Echo who use verygood reporters of a high standard, who are caring and understanding. What ismore the editors in these two companies do not change the story for their ownbenefit which is good.I think good quality local reporters are much better at putting our story overthat the national ones, simply because they care about local people and localissues If you are involved with television media, they always say look at the cameraand not the reporter, which is fine until they start asking questions, and thenyou automatically look at the person asking the questions. They neverunderstand that we want to listen to what is said, and usually that meanslooking at the person speaking to youBut its up to those with the illness, to try to get better treatment from thepress, and attempt to force through good quality guidelines, sowe stophearing words and phrases that we do not like.",

        "content": "Health officials should run an \"it's ne ver too late\" campaign to make the public aware of lifestyle changes they could make to help stave off dementia, a new report suggests. A number of factors can increase a  person's  risk of dementia in later life and people should be encouraged to take steps to protect themselves, according to the report commissioned by  Alzheimer's Disease International, a body representing dozens of organisations from around the world. The report authors, led by Professor Martin Prince from King's College London,  said that  low  education in early life, high blood pressure in midlife,  and smoking and diabetes across the whole life can increase a person's risk of developing dementia. They wrote: \" There is persuasive evidence that the dementia  risk for populations can be modified through  reduction in tobacco use and better control and  detection for hypertension and diabetes, as well  as cardiovascular risk factors. A good mantra  is 'What is good for your heart is good for your  brain'. \"B rain health promotion  messages should be integrated in public health  promotion campaigns such as anti-tobacco or  non-communicable disease awareness  campaigns, with the message that it's never too  late to make these changes. \" If we can all enter old age with better developed,  healthier brains we are likely to live longer,  happier and more independent lives with a much  reduced chance of developing dementia.\" A survey by healthcare provider Bupa, conducted on 8,500 people from six countries including 2,500 from the UK, also shows that many are unclear what steps they can take to reduce their risk of developing the condition, Alzheimer's Disease International said. Just over a sixth of people realised that social interaction with friends and family could impact on the risk. Only a quarter identified being overweight as a possible factor, and 23% said physical activity could affect the risk of developing dementia and losing their memories, the organisation said.Commenting on the report  Dr Eric Karran, director of research at charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said:  \"Although there is currently no certain way to prevent dementia, this report underlines strong evidence suggesting we can lower our risk by adopting a healthy lifestyle. \"A large body of research has linked high blood pressure, smoking and diabetes to an increased risk of dementia, and this analysis serves as another reminder that good heart health is an important route to good brain health. \"Studies have also suggested that education in early life may help build a level of 'cognitive reserve', helping the brain to withstand the damage from diseases like Alzheimer's for longer in later life. \"Importantly, this report highlights a need to understand better how to reduce the risk of dementia, which is why Alzheimer's Research UK is committed to increasing investment in this area of research. With over 830,000 people living with dementia in the UK, and that number set to increase, research into prevention is a crucial component in tackling this growing crisis.\"George McNamara, head of policy at the charity Alzheimer's Society said: \"We can no longer ignore the growing mountain of evidence that in many cases lifestyle factors play a key role in the development of dementia.\"We have long known that what is good for your heart is good for your head, but it is becoming increasingly clear that as well as searching for a cure we need to address lifestyle factors to ultimately help prevent dementia where possible.\"By the next general election 850,000 people in the UK will have dementia and the staggering human cost of the condition is met by an economic burden of \u00a326 billion.\"Anything we can do to make people aware of the role lifestyle factors can play in increasing risk not only makes sense to those people affected by it but could have real value to the economy.\" ",

Yes perhaps savings needed to be made, but not at the expense of those with this illnessThese days we are seeing more and more dementia cafe's along with services like singing for the brain, but the other services like the discussion groups seem to have disappeared.While these may be good, for some people I do feel that we need to be looking at generating new services, to help those who have no interest in singing.I spent 10 years in a church choir and enjoyed it, but these days I don't enjoy singing so much, so I have no intention of going down that route.I do think that there is a lot to be said about discussion groups, for people with the illness, as we got so much pleasure from being involved, and you always looked forward to the nextgroup sessionThese discussion groups used to generate a lot of interest, as we had a different topic each week, for local history,to hobbies and past times people used to enjoy.Some local groups have art classes which is brilliant, because there are many people who have dementia, and want to learn to paint, but these services are few and far between.We must remember that we are all different with different problems and symptoms, so no one topic suites everyone.Let us hope that in the future we get more good quality services provided for people with dementia, because like it or not, Is no good getting and early diagnosis, if you are then left trying to find your way through a very short supply of good services for people with dementia.",

No it's not new money, it's already in the system and just needs to be spend more wisely?So why did they tell the public that they were putting all this money into dementia in the first place. To me now I do think that these governments are doing nothing more than money laundering as they move it from one place to another, caring little about the damage caused.When it comes to elections next year we should all ask serious questions about what these politicians really think about dementia treatment.We also want a new strategy and one that removes these form of taxation on people with dementia and their carers,I always remember an old comedian called Dick Emery who once said. The only time a politician told the truth is when his lips are sewn up, and like some friends who have this illness I am starting to believe this",

        "content": "CAMPAIGN: Pledging to make a difference for people living with dementiaService users at Dementia Forward take part in the many activities offered by the charity. (S)Eeducation scheme to raise the public\u2019s level of understanding of dementia will soon be rolled out in the district and will have a big social impact, but dementia is also a disease with many repercussions for health. Reporter James Metcalf speaks to an expert about how health professionals are doing their bit.The nationwide campaign to make communities dementia-friendly reaches a key point in the Harrogate district later this month when charity Dementia Forward launches the project on a local level.Offering free education on a grass-roots level, this will no doubt affect how people living with dementia are treated in the street, in hotels, cafes, and high street businesses who can then pledge to make a difference and join the Dementia Action Alliance.But dementia is also a disease with a vast array of associated medical problems that affect people on a much more individual level.Hospitals are already playing a huge role in helping people with dementia, and will form a crucial part of the scheme to make the Harrogate district dementia-friendly as they continue to introduce creative and productive ways to help people cope with the disease.Dr Rick Sweeney is the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) lead for vulnerable people in the Harrogate and Rural District, and as such has responsibility for many people affected by dementia.He said: \u201cThe dementia-friendly campaign will impact on all of us, though I suspect the NHS has been trying to do this for a long time.\u201cMaking people more aware in the community is a really good thing and will benefit everybody with dementia, I think. It is a very good idea and a great event that gets people involved and people have already started getting involved.\u201cWe are doing quite a lot in the NHS, and we have made quite a lot of changes as the CCG and Harrogate Foundation Trust, which provides the services for physical illness in Harrogate.\u201dThese changes already in force include changing the way the memory clinic works, speeding up the diagnostic process, and work with GP practices to get better at recognising dementia.In hospitals things are also changing for the better, with A&E - a notoriously difficult place to function - becoming more dementia-friendly, and in-patient wards doing the same by changing colour schemes and making them less cluttered and confusing.And an enormous difference is already being felt after the way people with dementia were followed up after diagnosis changed dramatically.Dr Sweeney said: \u201cWhat the guidelines say is that they have to be followed up twice a year at the memory clinic and once by their GP, so that is three appointments at two different places.\u201cWhat we have done locally is make the GP carry out one of two appointments for people with a diagnosis to look at the medication, leaving the memory clinic to do the other one.\u201cThat has freed up around 700 appointments a year in the memory clinic for people with more complex problems.\u201cThe memory clinic was set up a long time ago, certainly before my involvement with the commissioning. They used to have very long waiting lists and they are now much better.\u201dThere are also many other schemes and projects being implemented in the Harrogate district, including specialist nurses assigned to all 42 of the area\u2019s care homes and GPs delivering anticipatory care before patients become seriously ill.This active intervention, which also includes a GP practice attached to every care home, should not only help people cope early in their condition, but also ease pressure on hospitals for when they are really needed.\u201cWe know the outcomes for people with dementia are worse than for people without dementia, so we hope they will now be in hospital for less time with specialist care from nurses,\u201d Dr Sweeney said.\u201cFor two per cent of people who seem most at risk GPs are developing active care and we have now extended that to four per cent, so that will affect people with dementia because they can have other complications as well.\u201dSuch moves, coupled with the active training in the community with the pilot scheme already completed, will make a huge difference to people living with dementia, and hopefully change their lives for the better.Attend the launch event at Holiday Inn, Harrogate on September 22, and sign up for the education programme.In the event of an emergency, contact Dementia Forward on their helpline 01765 601224.Val\u2019s story:With 3,000 people in the Harrogate district with a diagnosis of dementia, there are many individual stories of how people are uniquely affected by the disease.While some people have to deal with memory loss and mood changes, Val Reece, aged 67, finds it difficult to deal with her environment.She struggles with open-tread stairs and dark areas in restaurants and cafes, and the small changes businesses can make, by signposting a lift and adding new features to a room including more lights, can make all the difference to her comfort and sense of security.Her husband Ken, aged 66, said: \u201cThe dentist is good because he is switched on and aware and takes the trouble to help Val and the hairdresser is good, but we have been going there a long time.\u201cGoing somewhere new is a key thing. We went to a restaurant and asked for a window table because when it is dark it works against us, but people look at you quizically.\u201cVal talks to people normally and she presents well so they wouldn\u2019t know, but she is affected in other ways like with spatial awareness.\u201cWe went to Wetherby Swimming Pool and it was the first time she had been swimming for two years. She went to the disabled changing room and everything was white, so she couldn\u2019t see the toilet or anything, it was like a sheet of paper.\u201cIt is important that people are aware that if you walk with someone and are being led there is an issue.\u201dThese everyday difficulties that Val and Ken can tackle together often mean Ken has to do things for his wife.He goes shopping while she is at the Dementia Forward memory cafe, reads the menu in cafes and restaurants, and packs shopping bags.However, once businesses take part in the education programme, know how best to approach people living with dementia, and pledge to make simple changes to their property or practices, it is hoped the need for this will be less and Val can do things with the help of her local community.Business viewpoint:One local business getting on board with the campaign to make Harrogate dementia-friendly is independent advisory firm Kirby and Co.Based on the high street in Starbeck, the company is run by Peter Kirby who says he has grown older with his clients.Pledging to sign up for the education programme run by Dementia Forward after the launch event on September 22, Mr Kirby, who is 69, believes this will give him the knowledge and understanding he needs to support his clients who are living with dementia.He said: \u201cI think it is very important that people of my age stay in the business, so that when we have elderly clients we can speak the same language.\u201cTwo of my clients have Alzheimer\u2019s, and I am talking with their solicitors and, where we can, with the clients themselves as much as possible about what is best to do, what is available, and how to arrange their financial affairs.\u201cI am also going on their training from September and I know that will then involve having them come to me afterwards to see what I can do here for clients with dementia.\u201dMr Kirby currently relies on his years of experience dealing with people, but the education he will receive, which will help him recognise those affected by dementia and how to better communicate with them, will allow both his clients and himself to feel more comfortable.This, plus the long-arm support Dementia Forward offers to businesses after training, will make Kirby and Co. one of the many high street companies pledging to become dementia-friendly.Mr Kirby said: \u201cI went to a presentation that Dementia Forward did last year, and I am delighted to see it didn\u2019t stop there and now we have this campaign.\u201d",

        "content": "Never a day goes by when something is not said about people with some form of neurological illness, such as dementia and driving.It's a well known fact that once you are diagnosed with dementia etc, you have to notify the Driving authority, yet surely this should be down to the doctors or the specialist as they are responsible for your care.Failure to notify the authorities and insurance company that you have these illnesses, could cancel out your insurance and you could end up in court.To me it's wrong because if a doctor or specialist does not tell me to notify someone, to stop driving after a diagnosis and that leads to an accident, we can in law I believe sue them, for not informing them of the consequences. These people are hiding behind patient confidentiality red tape, and now its gone too far.Its not just driving safely in your view, but can your eyes keep focused on what is happening in front of you at all times.I say this because as many have found out, its the brain which dictates what happens and if the brain does not pick up the correct signals from the eyes, you are in trouble.I gave up driving on my own because I felt unsafe and was unsure about the official view, but that was before my diagnosis and medication.Since getting the medication I have started driving again but, I get assessed every year by my consultant, and then the forms are sent off to the driving authority.I never drive on my own and never get behind the wheel of the car if I don't feel right, and will never drive with children in the car, as that is a risk I cannot afford to takeIn many ways my licence is a waste of time because I rarely drive these days, and to be honest it does not bother me at all.But I do think that we are in the minority, because there are many drivers on the roads these days, who should be stopped as they are clearly dangerous.I often wonder how many elderly people are assessed for eyesight problems or reactions to speed, very few I would imagine simply because the doctors do not think it's their role to insist in this.Nearly every time I see my doctor, he asks about things like whether I am still driving, about my eyesight etc, even though he knows that I will never get in the car to drive it on my own, and will never drive if I don't feel up to it.I just do not wish to kill or hurt anyone, because I could never live with that on my mind.These days we see and hear of many youngsters starting to drive at an early age, and then some get them selves killed because they simply cannot handle the car, sadly these people usually end up killing others too.People wanting to ride motorbikes have to start with a small moped, and work up to the powerful bikes, so why not do the same with cars. I do not understand why youngsters can pass a driving test and then start driving a high speed car.I personally think that the laws in this country need to be tightened up, to stop youngsters getting into fast cars, until they have experience in all types of driving.I heard some time ago that if we were in a road accident as a driver, and the other insurance company found out that we had dementia, we would get the blame, whether it was our fault or not, yet people still drive around with mobile phones clamped to their ears, and get away with bad driving on a daily basis, something to me which is very wrong.These days I do feel that everyone should have a mandatory driving test every ten or twenty years to ensure that they are safe to drive, and that's not just people like us with neurological illnesses.But like it or not, I sometimes think we are victims of our own illness another form of stigma.I know my days of driving are coming to an end, but that's because I am using my common sense and understanding that things are getting to the stage where, I cannot do it for much more.But others carry on these days even though they cannot see, or cannot see the obvious, that they are becoming dangerous not just to themselves but also to others,I started driving back in 1968 and have driven all over, on holiday and at work, and in all honestly say that I enjoyed it.I had a very strict driving instructor who did not hold back if I made a mistake, and a very hard driving test, but that was in the days before these pass and go in a months or week driving schools came out.I personally think these places have allowed driving standards to get worse, but that's my opinion.I also learnt to drive in snow and icy conditions, something that many cannot do these days, and this causes accidents and traffic jams. I find it amazing that people driving four wheeled vehicles, get stuck in snow, simply because they are not taught to drive properly. \"its not the car its the driver\" But these days there are far too many idiots on the roads, and I am not talking about those with neurological illnesses, but many are people in the 18-50 year age bracket, who leave things too late, and just want to get in the car and drive like maniacs.It's the Jeremy Clarkson attitude, and this has made life harder.There are also many elderly people driving these days, when it's fairly clear that they should have stopped many years ago, but it's that little word pride which keeps coming up.Sometimes ourpride is bigger than the person.A car and driving is not the end of the world, if you are diagnosed with dementia etc, then give up when you are told or when you know that things are not right, and don't fight it, it really is not worth it, but remember the good times.Remember that its always better to stop early yourself, before you are forced to stop by others, and before you injure others.If you think that a person is becoming too dangerous to drive, seek advice on how to approach this problem, do not jump in with both feet demanding that they stop there and thenI honestly think that it takes courage to stop driving before its too late, and not everyone can do this, but with the correct support it can be handled carefullyI really hope that one of these days the medical profession will sort it's self out, and tell, people when they should stop driving, and also do the right thing tell the authorities themselves instead of sitting on the shelf letting others do their job for them.",

A driver with dementia was caught travelling the wrong way down the M6 [GETTY]Officers were called to the M6 toll in the West Midlands at around 9:50pm yesterday after reports flooded in to say a Honda Jazz was heading south on the northbound carriageway, between junction T5 and T4They were forced to take drastic action by crashing into the side of the car to get it to stop.Afterwards officers discovered that the driver was a 77-year-old man with dementia who had been reported missing by his family.Inspector Mark Watkins, from the Central Motorway Police Group, said that officers only smash into cars if there is a significant threat to other road users.\"It's a recognised pursuit tactic in order to bring incidents to a conclusion, and is only used if there's a risk to life,\" he said.This was an extremely unusual situation where the driver of the car had shown no intention to stop travelling in the wrong direction        Inspector Mark Watkins\"That forced the car to stop, and it came to a halt in lane three.\"The toll road where the crash took place was closed momentarily to clear the debris.The driver was checked over after the incident and was returned home to his family in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, unharmed while one officer suffered a minor injury.Inspector Watkins praised the entire team of officers for their brave actions.He said: \"This was an extremely unusual situation where the driver of the car had shown no intention to stop travelling in the wrong direction.\"Traffic officers bravely took the decision to engineer a collision with the vehicle and I am sure that their selfless actions have prevented serious injury or worse to the driver and other motorists on the road.\"We were relieved that we could bring this situation to a safe conclusion and return the man home safe and well to his family.\"",

It's not like a broken leg or arm where there is a plaster cast which is obvious, or someone who is blind and has a white stick.But how many times have you been told the same old words, you do not look like you have dementia,I often wonder if it's down to the fact that people feel embarrassed to talk to you about it, then just open their mouths and this falls out. I have been out walking with my wife on numerous occasions, and someone has stopped and spoken to her, then asked your clearly how I am, instead of asking me.My dear wife always answers with the same words, ask him yourself, he may have dementia, but he has a tongue and can speak and think for himself.I have to ask what dementia looks like? There are times I have spoken out and asked if people wanted me to have\" I have dementia tattooed on my forehead\" or should I be wearing a pair of horns like the old Vikings.I was tempted to have a sweat band printed with those words once, but then thought it would bring me down to their level.It's very strange these days, but I know that I am not the only one who has hear this being said, and sometimes, it gets hurtful as if people simply don't believe you.I do think that part of this is because years ago dementia was classed as a form of madness and those with the illness were locked away, or put into hospital wards out of the way.They also think that everyone who has the illness sadly sits in a corner dribbling, and I find that offensive. I have has people from social workers side of things who knew very little about Lewy body dementia, and made me feel like a Martian.I have also been given verbal abuse from a carer at a conference, because I got lost for words. At this time to help me cope I would often make a comment about my moth eaten brain, which I did at this event. Never thinking of what would happen. This lady waited till I let the room for the toilet, and nabbed me when I walkedv out of the toilet saying that I was dis respective to these with dementia. I tried to explain that I had Lewy body dementia and she used the same old words. You do not look like you have dementia. Later on when I was on a panel answering questions this lady got up and walked out, but never apologised once.Some people think that everyone who had dementia is deaf, as another social worker person kept shouting at me at home one day and then would come right up to my face, and shout at times. I am a mild person but this lady was very lucky not to have been slapped on this occassion because she also came out with the same old words. You do not look like you have dementia.We are not weird we simply have an illness which is not visible like many other people, and while we have dementia, it does not own us.

This understanding is vital in allowing us to develop new and better treatments. The discovery, published in the journal Human Molecular Genetics, has been made by an international team of researchers and was kick-started by a collaboration between Parkinson's UK and the Lewy Body Society. The study used tissue from over 1,000 brains donated for research to see if the genes involved in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's were also involved in Lewy body dementia. What is Lewy body dementia? Lewy body dementia is a type of dementia that is caused by the buildup of sticky protein deposits, called Lewy Bodies, inside brain cells. The condition has similar symptoms to both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, such as problems with attention and thinking, and visual hallucinations. People with Lewy body dementia may also develop motor symptoms that are common in Parkinson's such as tremor (shaking) and stiffness. Like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, the symptoms of Lewy body dementia also get worse over time. These similarities encouraged researchers to investigate if the same genes were involved in the 3 conditions. Genes involved in Lewy body dementia The genes involved in Lewy body dementia point towards a problem in the way brain cells break down waste \u2013 using a structure called the lysosome. This project was made possible by people donating their brains to research. This insight could open up new doors for research into treatment for Lewy body dementia and other conditions that affect the brain. Dr Jose Bras, Parkinson's UK-funded scientist, comments: \"Changes in genes can help scientists understand what goes wrong in conditions like Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's, and even help with diagnosis. \"This understanding is vital in allowing us to develop new and better treatments.\"Looking at what happens inside the brain is essential to understand human neurological conditions. This project was made possible by people donating their brains to research.\" - See more at: ",

I had over a year of eye tests, for my blurred and double vision, and it got distressing as I was fitted with glasses which ended up making things worse. However I have since learnt that it may not be the eyes but the brain causing the problem, and this is something that many ophthalmologists, don't understand. Its called, NeurologicalVisual Impairment, and has been studied by the Alzheimer's Society, andAlzheimer's Europealong withthe Thomas Pocklington Trust.So through this many things have changed, and my guess is that things will get worse over the next year or so. But I have had a few extra years to get to know my Grandchildren, and also help my wife to get things in order, so she is not left to deal with it all when things get worse.I know that I have been extremely lucky with my blog which is well read and now used as a teaching tool in Universities. I will carry on doing this as long as my eyesight holdsI also enjoyedgoing to conferences etc, and would have loved to carry on for one more year, butI am now ready to enjoy seeing my family more and doing other things like trying to do water colour painting, and if possible get to grips with my camera.So my advise to anyone who has just been diagnosed it to get involved with groups, and enjoy life as it comes.Never give in or sit back thinking of what may be coming, but try to be very positiveLife is for living go for it and enjoy it",

Two thirds of people over the age of 50 fear that they will develop the   condition, while just one in 10 said they were frightened about getting   cancer. Just under four per cent said they were frightened about getting a heart   condition and less than one per cent were concerned about developing   diabetes, according to a survey of 500 adults aged over 50 from across the   UK who were asked which condition they feared most. There are around 800,000 people with dementia in the UK but as the population   ages, this figure is expected to soar in coming years. Symptoms can include memory loss and difficulties with thinking,   problem-solving or language. It occurs when the brain is damaged by   diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or a series of strokes.  ''As an increasing number of people are diagnosed with dementia more people   are seeing the profound impact that it can have on both the individual as   well as the wider family,'' said Paul Green, director of communications at   over-50s company Saga, which conducted the survey. ''However whilst these fears are completely understandable, it's important   that education around the condition is enhanced to give a greater   understanding of the benefits of early diagnosis - and how this can help   those living with the condition continue to lead fulfilling lives.'' Commenting on the poll, Hilary Evans, director of external affairs at charity   Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ''It's no surprise to learn that fear of   dementia in people over 50 is high: dementia affects over 820,000 people in   the UK and we currently lack treatments to tackle the condition. ''The challenge is to find new ways to treat and prevent dementia to show   there is hope of taking on dementia and beating it. Research holds the   answer to this devastating condition and with the number of people affected   set to grow as the population ages, the need for investment in research has   never been more urgent.'' Alison Cook, director of external affairs at the Alzheimer's Society charity,   added: '''The possibility of losing the very essence of what makes you the   individual that you are is a frightening prospect.  ''But fear can mean people don't get a diagnosis and can often miss the   opportunity to access treatments (which are only effective for people in the   earlier stages of the condition) and the time to make important decisions   about their future. We urge anyone concerned about dementia to speak to   their GP and get in touch with Alzheimer's Society as there are lots of ways   we can help.''   ",

Yes there are guide lines, but bread does not contaminate the rivers as these two people tried to say. As well as that they kept talking about birds being caught up on hooks, since when have people fed birds bread with hooks in?Is this what the council spend our money on these days.I have written to the council but never got a reply.Like many other people who are ill and children etc I love walking round the rivers and have always loved this area since we moved here in 1953, so why does this or any other council try to spoilt our lives, when they cannot control things themselves,This used to be a lovely park which would be visited by thousands each weekend, now it's ind destroyed  by long grass and horses galloping through in weekend frightening dogs and children,It strikes me that durham county council has lost the plot these days",

The reason I say this is, why is it so bad for care homes to have pictures on a wall, when art galleries, libraries, and other public places,do it all of the time and no one says anything about it.Are these people saying that every home with pictures on the wall are fire hazards, and if so why has it never been said beforeI think that its time to look at all fire and health and safety regulations again, and try to remove some of the stupidity we see and hear every dayIt is clear to me as someone who used to do health and safety as my job as an engineer that this work is now being done by people who have little or no real knowledge of real life, and this must be sorted out because the UK is rapidly becoming the laughing stock of the world with every littleidiot telling us what we can and cannot do even though they have no real idea themselvesA CARE home has been turned into a prison by fire safety zealots, angry healthcare workers have claimed.                                     A care said dementia residents have been left distressed after they were ordered to remove art[ROSS PARRY]Dementia sufferers at the home have been left \"severely distressed\" after bosses were ordered to remove all art on their walls as it was a \"fire risk\".The pioneering nursing home was one of the first in the UK to use paintings to inspire, calm and motivate residents coping with end-stage Alzheimer's. But they were told by a fire inspector to take down the art leaving elderly residents so upset that some have refused to eat their meals.Other dementia sufferers have started wandering the corridors of The Clipstone Hall Residential Care Home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire aimlessly.Care home manager Linda Britain, 38, said: \"At the end of the day we are a home, not an institution or a hospital, and now it feels more like a prison.\"The care home uses paintings to held calm residents with end-stage Alzheimer's [ROSS PARRY]            The people who go into these places are going in there to die and if their last few months can be made a little happier then that should be the priority        Volunteer Joyce BanburyStaff at the nursing home had worked with the Alzheimer's Society to pioneer the art-based treatment following a campaign from relatives.All the displays, which were devised by dementia experts, could have been touched by residents as they walked the corridors.But employees said the formerly bright and cheerful atmosphere has completely changed - and it is distressing residents.Ms Britain said: \"People who suffer from dementia tend to walk up and down corridors aimlessly, in a world of their own, and it can be very difficult for staff to interact with them.\"But having these visual aids, as well as the textured pieces, means staff can bring residents out of their shell by asking them questions, or asking them to describe things.\"Ms Britain said removing the art from the walls has had a \"devastating impact\" on elderly residents.She explained that one woman used to suffer anxiety attacks when she was asked to enter an area full of people but the paintings helped calm her down.Linda Britain and Diane Lilliman from Clipstone Hall Residential Care Home [ROSS PARRY]Ms Britain said within 20 minutes the art had helped remove her anxiety but now the paintings have been removed she stays tense for up to three hours.She said another resident cries every night now the walls are bare because she thinks the care home has been burgled.Joyce Banbury, 62, visited her 92-year-old mother Annie Addis at the care home until she died a year ago and now volunteers at Clipstone Hall.She said: \"The place looks absolutely awful now. \"The people who go into these places are going in there to die and if their last few months can be made a little happier then that should be the priority. \"We had a meeting with the fire inspector last week and he really wouldn't listen - it just makes you think that he has got it in for us for some reason.\"Bosses said the care home now looks like a prison without the paintings [ROSS PARRY]Ms Britain added Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue's reasons for ordering to remove the art has not been explained in a way that they fully understood.She said: \"They just told us that, as the corridors were escape routes, they had to be 'sterile'. \"Their concern was not that the displays would catch on fire, but that increased heat could cause more smoke from the displays.\"But the spray that treated the displays guarantees four hours of fire and smoke resilience - which is over three hours longer than the fire doors can offer, so it seems pointless to me.\"We've had these displays up for four years now and there's never been a problem with it before.\"A selection of the art removed from the care home [ROSS PARRY]Sherwood MP Mark Spencer said he has written to Nottinghamshire's chief fire officer asking him to over-rule the decision. He said: \"I went to look around the home quite recently and one of the things they are really proud of is the artwork on the walls. \"It's not just that it looks nice, it's really important for the residents - it' s the familiarity of the images that are genuinely beneficial. \"What we have is an overly enthusiastic member of staff at Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue who hasn't got the balance right.\" The Alzheimer's Society said it was \"disappointing\" the art had been removed from the care home.George McNamara, Head of Policy and Public Affairs, said: \"It is disappointing that the art work has been removed. \"Fire safety and a vibrant and engaging care environment are both important issues, but in this case they haven\u2019t gone hand-in-hand.  \"Reminiscence, in the form of pictures or other visual aids, can be a valuable tool for communication and engagement with someone with dementia, as well as giving that homely feel. \"Hopefully a compromise can be found that enables residents to continue art-based activities whilst not increasing any potential fire risk.\"The Alzheimer's Society said it was \"disappointing\" the art had been removed from the care home [ROSS PARRY]Vic McMillen, who is in charge of Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue's fire protection team, added: \"All business owners have a legal obligation to ensure their premises, and all those who use them, are protected from fire. \"We are happy to work with any business owner to help them interpret the current guidance so they can continue providing stimulating and comfortable surroundings without comprising people's safety.\"",

This government is not doing anything to stop this, possibly because they may well have financial links, and could be making money already at our expense.This is the National Health Service and not a private businessThere are far too many private jobs being done on the health service now, and its obvious that the service can no longer cope, so changes need to be brought in before its too late.There are also far too many people abusing the system these days and this needs to stop. This includespeople coming into the country for free treatment, when they should be paying too and this needs to be looked.But when we look these days we are always seeing stories of ladies going in for breast implants etc which are not important, people getting nose jobs done which are only to make someone look better, but let's be honest about this, if it's not needed as the result of an accident etc, it should be paid for privately. It's not the first time managers have allowed these things to go through yet, people wanting treatment for cancer etc, are told to buy their own medication because the health service cannot afford it.If this happened in a private business these managers would be sacked, ans so they shouldBy the same token every week we hear of people getting drunk, needing an ambulance and hospital treatment. Surely they should be given the bill because this is self inflicted, these people are just abusing a system which is overloaded, and many become abusive to hospital staff.What happened to the days when people accepted their bodies and got on with life. I could understand them wanting to change if they had birth defects, but changing because they don't like the size of their breasts or nose etc,is wrong and should not be subsidised by the publicMillions of pounds is wasted on these drunks every week and it's very wrong, we should go back to the old days when drunks were put in a police cell for the night, and sometimes got charged with being drunk. These people soon stopped getting drunk because they knew full well what would happenHowever one of the major faults these days is that the health service is run by management which is too top heavy, so we should go back to the days when the service was run by qualified health service staff, ie doctors and matrons etc all run with a board who were accountable to the patients.These days if a hospital is in the news for the wrong reason, guess who is never mentioned, the one person who is responsible for running the place the \"Chief Executive\", yet they are paid \u00a3150-000 plus and get golden handshakes when they leave, or are forced to leave because they have failed to run the hospital properly Having worked in the health service many years ago when the boards with matrons and doctors ran a hospitals, I was horrified when Chief Executives were brought in because I said things would get worse, and here we are.We should go back to these old ways of running this service, where everyone in the health service was accountable from the cleaners up to the board and no golden hand shakes were given out for failure. If you failed you got the sack.It's now time to change the health service and bring back to old principals, where there were very few infections because hospitals were spotlessly clean, and everyone had high standards. What is more there was no government red tape, because it was and is not needed if everyone does their job properly in the first place.But before we can do that we need to change government attitudes towards our national health service, to stop interference, money wasting and wholesale privatisation.I may have dementia but I can see this is heading for total disaster and it has to be stopped now before its all sold off and we end up paying for basic treatment in the future",

        "content": "               Someone asked the other day, 'What was your favourite 'fast food'    when you were growing up?'    'We didn't have fast food when I was growing up,' I informed him.    'All the food was slow.'    'C'mon, seriously.. Where did you eat?'    'It was a place called 'home,'' I explained.    'Mum cooked every day and when Dad got home from work, we sat down together    at the dining room table, and if I didn't like what she put on my plate, I    was allowed to sit there until I did like it.'        By this time, the lad was laughing so hard I was afraid he was going    to suffer serious internal damage, so I didn't tell him the part about how    I had to have permission to leave the table.        But here are some other things I would have told him about my childhood if    I'd figured his system could have handled it:        Some parents NEVER owned their own house, wore jeans, set foot on a golf    course, travelled out of the country or had a credit card.        My parents never drove me to school. I had a bicycle that weighed probably 50    pounds, and only had one speed, (slow).        We didn't have a television in our house until I was 10.    It was, of course, black and white, and the station went off the air at 10    pm, after playing the national anthem and epilogue; it came back on the air    at about 6 a.m. And there was usually a locally produced news and farm show    on, featuring local people...        I never had a telephone in my room. The only phone was on a party    line. Before you could dial, you had to listen and make sure some people    you didn't know weren't already using the line.        Pizzas were not delivered to our home... but milk was.        All newspapers were delivered by boys and all boys delivered    newspapers--My brother delivered a newspaper, seven days a week. He had to    get up at 6AM every morning.                         Film stars kissed with their mouths shut. At least, they did in the films.    There were no movie ratings because all movies were responsibly produced    for everyone to enjoy viewing, without profanity or violence or almost    anything offensive.        If you grew up in a generation before there was fast food, you may    want to share some of these memories with your children or grandchildren.    Just don't blame me if they bust a gut laughing.                Growing up isn't what it used to be, is it?        MEMORIES from a friend:    My Dad is cleaning out my grandmother's house (she died in December) and he    brought me an old Royal Crown Cola bottle. In the bottle top    was a stopper with a bunch of holes in it... I knew    immediately what it was, but my daughter had no idea. She    thought they had tried to make it a salt shaker or something. I    knew it as the bottle that sat on the end of the ironing board to    'sprinkle' clothes with because we didn't have steam irons.    Man, I am old.        How many do you remember?    Headlight dip-switches on the floor of the car.    Ignition switches on the dashboard.    Trouser leg clips for bicycles without chain guards.    Soldering irons you heated on a gas burner.    Using hand signals for cars without turn indicators.        Older Than Dirt Quiz:    Count all the ones that you remember, not the ones you were told about.    Ratings at the bottom.        1.

        "content": "When we get any illness whether it is dementia, cancer or something else which turns out to be a long term illness, we are buried by the diagnosis and what is going to happen, not always thinking of what may be coming in the future.Some people refuse to accept any diagnosis and leave others to pick the pieces up at a later date.Like many I spend time trying to keep my head above water, keeping active while trying to keep control over my life, something which does not always come naturally, but I feel that I have to try, not just for myself but also for my wife and family.If you are lucky you may be blessed with having plenty of support and good quality services around you. You may even have had good quality support from the diagnosis onwards, but these days that all depends on where you live.But there are few local places where our loved ones can go for support, simply because this is patchy, as like it or not everyone with these illness is so different to anyone else, so support for one carer may not help someone else.Caring is a voluntary role with little training, it's a case of feeling your own way as you go, and coping with problems as they come. It sounds easy in principal, but I know that could never do it, but then my brain is not so good anymore these days, so how do these people cope with a role that they never expected to do.To the governments these carers are a very good way to save the country lots of money, because like it or not, these wonderful people do save the UK hundreds of millions of pounds each year.But the sad thing is that no matter what any government says, I personally feel that they have little or no respect for any carer, if they did they would make sure that carers were given the support they badly need, financially etc, from professionals. But these days there are very few professionals in the community who know about these illness and truly care about their work genuinely.So perhaps now it's time for a change, to ensure that all carers, who like it or not are our 24 hour back up and support, get support themselves and get it from the government services at no extra cost to ourselves.This rest should also cover a weekends rest when needed, because it cannot be easy looking after someone 24 hours a day 7 days a week, while ignoring your own needs.These people pick us up when things don't work the way they should and support us through the worst periods, yet like it or not this puts a great deal of pressure and added stress on themThese illnesses are not self inflicted yet we are penalised because we need support, this in turn puts extra pressure on our loved ones and carers who have to work their way through government legislation and red tape.I do think many governments think that if we don't understand where to look we cannot claim the support we may need.This illness is cruel, but it must be so hard for our carers to watch this illness take away our lives, and our dignity.God blessall carers as without them we would all be lost.",

Its not just the services which can cause problems , but stressful situations like riots, or any kind of aggression can make life miserable.I guess that any person with dementia 's rights will be none existent in many cases, simply because many countries hide their cases of dementia or keep it with in the family, so that the services cannot get to them and give the support they desperately need to get on with their lives.

It was a busy life working all hours and being on call 24 hours a day for whatever life threw at me.I was never bothered about working at heights, and for some reason I do not understand, I enjoyed it.Since thenmy son who is also an Electrical Engineer, has told me on numerous occasions, I would spend time working on live electrical systems something which has now been banned for obvious reasons, but it was my job and I just got on with it.My boss always said that when the chips were down, I stepped up a gear and thrived on stressful situations.These days I cannot remember much about my job, and cannot be relied on to fit a 13 amp plug top safely. This has come as quite a shock as I once rewired our college chapel, something I was thrilled to do, so to forget so much of my job has been hard to accept.Heights are something I can no longer cope with, and on odd days standing at the top of an empty staircase fills me with total fear. If we are out anywhere my wife, she has to go downstairs in front of me, and I follow her closely. At home on my own I come down stairs hanging on to the handrail and the opposite wall never looking down at any stage.I used to have very good eyesight but now this has gone, and at times struggle with either blurred or double vision, something which has brought in extra hazards along with my balance which is getting much worseThe eyesight problems it seems are related to the Brain it seems, as the brain is not detecting what my eyes are seeing on occasions.To make things even more interesting my hearing is also going from bad to acute at times.However this is one of the things aboutthis illness, which destroys everything in its path as it progresses.",

This did not go down too well, but we then started to get answers after a few months of tests etc.I have met may people over the years who were in the same boat, who like me were later diagnosed as having dementia of one sort or another, so why did these doctors not look for the cause of the depression if we indeed, had it in the first place.Is depression the answer to all doctors these days, a quick fix.I know some people who were put in mental institutions and were treated with electric shocks etc, only to find out later that they had dementia, but there were no apologies for this serious error.Yes there is depression in dementia, and to be very honest who would not be depressed in one way or another, when they are losing control over their lives, at work, with hobbies along with other things.Like many I got to the stage where I refused to accept that I felt depressed when things did not work the way they had for years, because I was convinced the consultant would try to change things, as many consultants refused to accept that depression was and is part of dementia.This proves that diagnosis has a long way to go before people with this illness are treated properly.We all know that there are different types of depession, but are doctors lumping all types together simply because they do not know, or is it an easy answer to all.But there are far too many people on anti depressants these days, when they should not be on them, then,they cannot get off them.Let us hope that in the future doctors get better training in both dementia and depression, so they fully understand our problems, and look into the cause of the so called depression before going too deep into treatments that may well not be needed, nor will they solve our problem.I was extremely lucky to get a brilliant consultant in the North East who knew about Lewy body dementia, and told me to keep myself active and busy, so that I never got to the stage where I would get depressed at losing control, and then giving up altogether.In her words try something one day, if that fails try on a second day and a third.If that fails give up altogether and do something else, do not try to hang on to things you can no longer do.Life is too short, go out enjoy each day as it comes and try something new if you are up to it.Her kind words have kept me going, yes I get depressed when things don't work, but then I pick myself up and try to move on.I know that when I lose control of my computer, I may well have problems as this is my life, but I am trying to be as positive as I can, and hope that never ever happens while I can fight it.",

A thumbs up, smile etc all act as part of this persons vocabulary, if people cannot take this on board then they should never ever be employed by a dementia charity, or work in social services.Dementia is an age related or is a natural part of ageingSo what about the thousands of people under the age of 65. This myth is kept going by all of the picture we see these days at dementia conferences etc which are of old people.Yes there are many people over 65, but we are now seeing and hearing of more and more people under the age of 65 these days so we must take this on board and move on.People are being diagnosed at an earlier age these days, yet we never hear much about these cases unless you have access to the internet.However the internet websites are not always up to date so some of the information is either out of date or in some cases wrong",

So if you know anyone who has this illness, see if you can help them to stay active by enjoying their hobbies and past times.",

Nowthis was all starting to slide away, and it was a struggle to hang on toworking on my computer, but I was determined that I was going to hang on tothis for as long as possibleAfterthe diagnosis I lost my job, and it was decided that we should move back to thefamily home in the North East, where we could start again, but that was not aseasy as we expected, because with in the three months since my diagnosis OxfordHospitals had lost my notes, and after waiting for around 6 months, it wasdecided that I should undergo all of the tests again to confirm the diagnosis WhenI was finally diagnosed as having early onset Lewy Body Dementia, in Durham, myconsultant told me to sit down and write my life story as a way of allowingothers like any future grandchildren the chance of learning more about who Iwas and where I came from, as much of my early life was unknown.Duringanother part of the process which concerned my very graphic nightmares anddreams, I was told to keep a diary, and write down what happened, to see if itbore any relation to normal lifeAfterstarting my life story I decided to keep an online diary, not really thinkingof what I was letting myself in to, because I had lost so much control over thecomputer since the illness started.Soafter a while I found this free blog and got on with writing about my life andthen my illness, gradually taking in things like the problems with graphicnightmares etc.Atthis stage I confess to being na\u00efve enough not to think that anyone would belooking at it let alone reading it. But then life with dementia was and issomething which is still alien to my life as an engineer, and I don\u2019t alwaysrecognise the obvious things in life these days, which can be very annoying anddistressing at times.Overa period of around two years I would write the occasional blog and never thinkabout it, until one day when I saw something which I had never noticed before,and that was a button saying \u201cAudience\u201dIlooked at that wondering what on earth it could be, and got the shock of mylife when the audience was revealed. It was being read around the world bythousands of people,Afew weeks later I spotted another button saying comments. At first I thought itwas where I could write comments, and ignored it. However for some reasonunknown to me I went back later and pressed that button, where I found pages ofcomments, from people. Thatnearly stopped me from doing any more as this came as a total shock to thesystem. WhenI read some of the comments, I was totally amazed at the fact that my attemptat blogging was in fact helping others to come to terms with their diagnosis,because they had been having problems and had no answers.Tobe very honest I found this very humbling to read some of these comments,because I had never set out to help anyone but myselfHoweverthis inspired me and became a little addictive at times as I kept looking atthe screen to see who was watching me and where they were, so to speak.Ihave been questioned at times about my spelling and grammar, but do thesepeople who question us really think that I am doing this for fun.Yeswe all make mistakes and it hurts when we don\u2019t see them, but that\u2019s dementia.How many people in this room do e-mails etc. and forget to do a spell check?Ihave received many e-mails from professionals over the years, and some of themistakes, made me wonder, if they really caredIused to be very proud of my spelling and grammar, so when things like thisstart to slide it leaves you wondering whether to give up all together. Luckilyfor me I was advised to ignore these people because they had no idea of theproblems I face on a daily basis, and I would advise others to do the same.I have beencontacted by three or four Universities around the world, for permission to usethe Blog as a Teaching tool. This I found to be very humbling, as I never setout to do this, but if this is helping to train people doing degrees or othercourses in Dementia, then so be it. So why do we blog?and is there a need for it when you have an illness like dementiaIthink that we must remember that doctors and consultants cannot tell useverything about dementia, because there are so many variations of the illness,so it\u2019s a case of finding your own way where you can, and if possible writingsomething like a blog which can help others following you. RecentlyI have noticed that there are many blogs about dementia, many written by carersand many others written by people living with one or other form the illness.Idon\u2019t think I had read one which is negative in any way, but then my idea ofwhat is negative may be different to someone else\u2019sIthink we are all trying to prove that we are not going to lie down andsurrender to this illness while we can still think and push the keys on thekeys boardIconfess the key board is hard at times, and when this happens the voiceactivated software takes over, but that\u2019s a last resort.Allof these are vastly different using different ideas and technics. Ihave struggled recently due to recurring chest infections which left me feelingthat I was losing interest in everything around me. So I have not done a lotover the last year apart from posting articles concerning dementia bothnational and local, but hopefully this will change soonTwoyears ago we were badly flooded at home and had to move into a flat for 6months, a period I don\u2019t remember much about, but it got very difficult to copewith.Duringthe November I decided to try to tidy up the blog, but somewhere along the lineI pressed the wrong button, and deleted the whole blog. I contacted Google atthe time to see if they could help but go not helpful answer so I felt stuck.Mywife told me that there were two ways of dealing with this, either let it go,or as everything was written in word before being posted on the blog, I couldstart all over again. I had got quite a lot out of doing this blog so I startedall over again.Sincerestarting this blog on 11/11/2014 our wedding anniversary, I have now reachedover 61-000 readers in 106 countries, something I find to be truly amazing  Usefulinformation about blogging it is a very useful     communication tool with othersit is my memory bank, of     problems I struggled withit helps immensely with     managing some of the symptoms of dementia, as writing it down sometimes     helps us to understand what is happeningit helps to keep my brain     active and workingit helps us to be creativeI have met many new and     wonderful friends, who share similar problems whether they are living with     dementia or are caring for someone with the illnessit gives me a focus on     the days I feel lost to the symptoms of dementia, and gives me a good     reason to try to stay focused I have many friends now     from all around the worldit has connected me with     students and Universities all over the world, along with, centres for     dementia degrees and coursesit has helped define me     beyond the diagnosis of dementiaIt helps occasionally to inspire     others with the illnessit has helped me receive     and accept criticism more easilyit has sometimes helped     to improve my writingit gives me something to     do when I am home alone, when my wife is out or busyIt helps to educate     othersit reduces the stigma,     discrimination, and isolationand provides me with     meaningful and fun-filled engagementOverall itmakes us a better person and helps us to help others in all parts of the world,and language is no barrier thanks to google where we have translations. Because aswe write or problems down we are not only helping ourselves, but also helpingmany others who do not have the support that we do.There are a few pitfalls of blogging, the biggest for me having beensome comments I have had seemed particularly mean, maybe not intended to behurtful, but hurtful none the less.But I have learnt to read them and then delete the negative ones,because other people tend to fight back when they see bad comments. What I write is my opinion, andat no time do I every declare it to be a \u2018fact\u2019. Nor do I ever say that we areall the same, because that would be wrong",

The North East\u2019s first Admiral Nurse is employed by the hospice but will get clinical supervision through the Admiral Nurse organisation, which is supported by Dementia UK.Sharron has been recruited to the hospice to establish ties within the community and with health care providers.The ultimate aim is to help people living with dementia to stay at home safer and longer, and to support their carers.Sharron said: \u201cMost people with dementia want to stay at home and most carers want them to stay at home. But the first step is diagnosis. After that, carers can access support in County Durham through community health teams, GPs and social workers. \u201cThey can get gadgets in the home that help people stay safely at home, like cut-off switches for gas cookers and sensors on outside doors to alert people if someone is leaving.\u201cWe want to raise awareness of dementia to ensure fewer people in our community go undiagnosed. We hope to offer education and peer support groups for carers, hosted here at the hospice, and we hope in time to offer limited places to people with dementia, which is a life-limiting illness.\u201dSharron added that establishing the views of people living with dementia was also very important to ensure that they have a voice and involvement in the services they are receiving. Sharron\u2019s appointment is in response to the rapidly growing numbers of people living and dying with dementia in County Durham. Figures quoted in Durham County Council\u2019s 2013 Joint Strategic Needs Assessment show that by 2030, there will be a 78 per cent increase in the numbers of people with late-onset dementia in the county. About 3,000 people have been diagnosed with dementia in County Durham, but that is only half the expected number, meaning there are thousands more who have not been diagnosed.",

Some refused, simply sighting the high costs of the training, and the fact that they would have ended up paying their staff more moneyThese days everyone is out to make a profit whether it is a hospital or care home, so they are not going to spend money on extra training.I do however think those staff who do this training, by themselves are raising standards, and should be praised for doing this, but I just wish employers would do more to help with this officially.These days we are seeing more dementia training sessions being set up around the country, but I think more should be done to make this mandatory to all care home ans nursing staff, in fact anyone in the public services who may come into contact with people with dementiaI think that most of us had hoped to see dementia support workers being used, straight from the point of diagnosis, but these days this does not seem to have happened, and it's very hit and miss where it does happen, bit like a post code lottery.This is very sad as many struggle to accept the illness, let alone manage to move on after it.This is when we all need support, and if given this support many people would have accepted the illness at an earlier stage, and could have done something positive with the rest of their lives.I do think that Governments over the last twenty years or so have given up their role of caring for the elderly, because they are allowing local council care homes to be closed down, then forcing many who need care to sell their homes to pay for the required services, something I find to be totally wrong, when these same people have worked hard all of their lives and have paid taxes and national insurance.So this is in effect another form of taxation.So perhaps its time for these governments to step up and do the right thing, by providing the proper free care, which should be a basic right for any elderly person, including those who have dementia, who ask for nothing more than to finish their days with good care, and being treated with the dignity and care which others take as their right.Good quality care is a basic right for all so its up to all to campaign and force governments to step up and help those in need.I am hoping that the next Government picks the Strategy up and extends it for another 5-10 years, so we really do some big changes in dementia.This has taken some time, so it's up to everyone who has the illness or knows someone who has the illness, to campaign and push their members of parliament in to ensuring that the strategy remains high on the list of priorities over the next 5 years at least.",

A common remark is, you have seen one person with dementia, you know it all as we are all the same.There may well be around 10 types of dementia, but within that there are well over 120 variations, so no two people are the same. We are all individuals on individual journeys with vastly different symptoms and problems.One thing hurled at people with dementia is, you cannot have this illness because you should have deterriated by now.Here again they think we are all the same and should have deterriated, very soon after the diagnosis.The answer to this is quite simply. Many of us were told to fight to remain active after the diagnosis, both bodily and brain wise.As a consultant once told me. You either use it or you lose it.That has kept me going, as I spend most nights doing games to keep myself active, even after I have been active at home. As my wife often says, I never sit still very long.Yes I have lost the ability to do many things since my diagnosis, but if I lose one thing I try something else.Losing control over your life is not nice but we have to fight on if only for our loved ones.It's now time to stop these horrible remarks and start to educate people, and prove these people wrong",

There is nothing worse than a publication, written for general release which Is full of medical jargon.Some are involved with meetings setting up new methods of helping others who have the illness.One or two of us are involved in giving presentations about living with the illness, and these are well accepted by establishment these days.It has often been said that people take more notice when a person with the illness stands up and speaks from the heart, because they are indeed the professionals in dementia as they are living with it.Many people with dementia benefit from being involved, as it gives them a positive feeling, a feeling that they are wanted and thus also helps others to realise that we can do things, whether discussing projects, speaking or advising others about what would work best.I have been involved in many projects, however it has been noticeable that one or two have you there so that they can simply tick a box, implying that they involved a person with dementia, whether they listen to what was said did not matter to them.It mattered to me and found this to be disgusting, especially if it was a government department who should have known better, but all of this depends of whether the chair of the meeting is dementia friendly or not.We have a saying, Nothing about us without us. Meaning do not talk about us without involving us, as we know better than you as we are living through the illness.If you are really interested in learning more about the illness, or setting up a project about dementia, then why not ask someone with the illness to come along and get involved.

This would also allow me to get my life into order, so that my wife was not left to sort things out on her ownAt this visit we were also told of any problems that the medication could throw up, but i still wanted to give it a go as I had nothing to loseI was then told to set myself a routine, which would get me through the day, as take some pressure off my wife.I was also told to write my life story, as most of my life was untold. This would help keep my brain active, and in the end would allow my future grand children to learn about my life, who I was, where i came from etcWe were also told to visit our local branch of the Alzheimer's Society where we would get extra support and help.As I was having major problems with nightmares at nights, sometimes very graphic, I was asked if I would write them down, to see if the clinical psychologist could look at them.This I could do as they were so graphic that I could still talk about them the next dayI could not find a diary big enough so I started doing this in a blog on line, not realising at the time what I was doing.I though blogs were personal at the time and did not get read anywhere elseIt was only about three months later I found out that others were actually reading this, it was a blog going world wide.This is one problem with thus illness, as we do not always see the obvious.However around a year later I found that this blog was actually helping other people to come to terms with their illness, and was helping carers understand what their loved ones were going through.Information should be given at the point of diagnosis, by medical staff, however not all consultants will do this, and I know now that I was extremely lucky to be given the information and support at the time.But a dementia nurse or support worker could do this, if they are really good, and they will give enough support to make sure that we understand what we are doing.I must also point out that as this was done at a hospital dealing with dementia, we were also given emergency telephone numbers, if we needed help during the night or weekend.We all struggle to ask questions after a diagnosis like this, because if feels horrible when the diagnosis Is given, your brain goes blank. It's later on that the questions come, and by then there is no one to ask as the clinic has probably closed.There are many chat rooms on the internet, where we can go to ask questions 24 hours a day, but this is only a good tool if we can use the internet and gave a computer. Some places have telephone call centres which can help.I am hoping that in the future we will see more good quality information at the point of diagnosis, as recommended in the National Dementia Strategy, and this will carry us through a diagnosis that in all honesty no one wants.",

        "content": "After reading about the Governments Dementia research plans, it prompted me to think about itMr Cameron the British Prime Minister wants to encourage research companies to look further into possible cures for dementia.This to many people with dementia is the holy grail, and we all live in hope that someone will come up with a cure sooner or later.There are medications on the market which help slow the illness down but nothing that stops or prevents it.#Many people think that this will never work, as its too costly, and many companies have looked at this over the years, and then gave up because of the failures and the vast cost involved. This research also costs millions of pounds with very little to show at timesAs well as all of this we have to consider the fact that if something does come out of this, it may well be squashed by the British Governments own departments, like the National Institute for Clinical Excellence as being too costly, or not worth the money.This group stopped people getting dementia medication a few years ago, then they reversed their decision.However, in that time some drug companies said that they would stop working on dementia treatments, something that was understandable but also very sad.When I look back, these research companies also had similar problems in the 1950-60s with Cancer treatment and cures, however this has moved on, so there is some hope for those of us with dementia.But when we look at many have said in the past that dementia is not a trendy enough illness to warrant the millions of pounds in research, but without this research, millions of people will have to put up with this horrible illness, which wrecks people lives and families.Many of us have lost friends and jobs, and this only makes a bad job much worse.I think we are now seeing changes because many now realise that dementia is not age related, but can be got at any age in life.Dementia is also not just one but a group of many diseases, which cause problems with the brain. There are also well over 120 variations of dementia, so no two people are the sameWe are all individuals with individual problems and symptomsSo let us hope that somewhere along the line this research is successful and new treatments are made available, in the future.We can all be cynical about whether this is just another ploy by a Government to take the heat off themselves by discussing dementia, but we all need to go with this in the hope something comes out of it.It may well be too late for many like myself, but at least those following will stand a better chance.Many like myself who are on medications which are supposed to slow the illness, have also made lifestyle changes, in an attempt to add extra years. This like trying the Mediterranean diet, or Indian curries etc which are supposed to help stop the illness, but do they work, I don't know, but anything is well worth trying.",

        "content": "Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday called for the UK to be more \u201cdementia-friendly\u201d to help sufferers and urged an increase in international funding for research to find a cure.He announced that the Government is doubling funding for dementia research to \u00a366m, but insisted that other countries needed to step up their efforts to deal with the rising numbers living with the condition.Yet leading dementia experts in the North East say it is essential that more is done to help highlight the social impact of the condition.Dr Lynne Corner, a social gerontologist specialising in dementia research, and Director of Engagement at Newcastle University Institute for Ageing, was at the summit where Mr Cameron made his speech.She said: \u201cIt is of course good news that David Cameron has announced such an enormous boost to dementia research funding. Yesterday\u2019s summit would also have been the perfect opportunity to highlight the social impact of dementia as well as the health aspects.\u201cDementia is not only a health issue, which is how it is often treated, it\u2019s also a social and societal challenge. One in three people over 65 will die with dementia, and many more will know someone with dementia, whether a loved one, neighbour or co-worker. It impacts many peoples lives in many different ways.\u201cAs well as funding research to understand the causes of dementia and treat dementia, we need more funding for services that help people living with dementia, especially carers. We need to fund projects that help us understand how people with dementia can live happier, more connected lives and how carers can be helped and supported.\u201cThere is already some great work out there, for instance projects using digital technology to help those suffering with dementia increase their engagement in society, which need public recognition, support and funding if we are going to meet this challenge.\u201dMore than 300 health and finance experts listened to the Prime Minister at a summit in London to discuss the important issue, where he warned of a \u201cmarket failure\u201d on dementia drug research and development.Last year, the UK used its presidency of the G8 to host an international summit on dementia, which ended with experts setting a global ambition to find a cure by 2025.Yesterday, delegates came together again for the first in a series of legacy events following the summit and were told by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt that there is a \u201cdesperate need\u201d for more investment in research. The economic and social reasons to find a cure, or disease-modifying therapy, cannot be ignored, Mr Hunt said.Rob Stewart, North East communications and media officer for the Alzheimer\u2019s Society branch in Newcastle acknowledged that improvements for dementia patients had been made in recent years but more still needed to be done.He said: \u201cWe have seen the huge progress that has been delivered for cancer research because of a sustained boost in funding and now need the same for people with dementia. David Cameron\u2019s announcements mean the UK is leading the fight in dementia research but our global partners will be crucial to fulfilling the promise of the G8.\u201cSince the Prime Minister launched his dementia challenge in 2012, research funding has been increased and there\u2019s been a huge amount of activity to tackle dementia, leading to the first ever G8 summit dedicated to a condition and a landmark pledge to find a cure or treatment by 2025.\u201cThis has put dementia on the agenda so the condition is beginning to get the attention it deserves alongside other diseases, however there is still a long way to go.\u201dIt is estimated that by 2021 there will be as many as a million people with dementia and costs are set to rocket from the \u00a323bn per year that dementia already costs the economy.There is no cure for the condition and there have been no new treatments for dementia since 2003 - those available do little to slow the progression of the disease.Earlier, Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK announced a \u00a3100m research campaign and the Medical Research Council said it was undertaking the world\u2019s biggest study into dementia, involving two million people.Mr Stewart added: \u201cDeveloping drugs can take decades, cost billions and people with dementia have all too often had their hopes dashed by clinical trials that end in failure. We need to do whatever we can to clear any roadblocks that stand in the way of getting new drugs to the people who need them.\u201cHowever, that\u2019s not to say that drug manufacturers should be allowed to cut corners on safety - people need full information about outcomes of trials and possible side effects so they can assess with their doctor whether a medicine would help them or not.\u201dGrandfather Ken Clasper, 67, of Chester-le-Street, was diagnosed with dementia more than 10 years ago yet continues to live his life to the full.He said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just one illness; there are more than 120 variations of dementia so there certainly won\u2019t be a cure-all found when I\u2019m alive. The cost of finding a cure for dementia will be astronomical. We need a lot more money to be spent on finding a cure and I really hope that the pharmaceutical industry will follow David Cameron\u2019s lead and plough more resources into research.\u201cDementia has been left behind in comparison with cancer when it comes to research and it is high time this is put right but there will be no quick answers.\u201cThe Government\u2019s announcement is very welcome. We\u2019ve got to be in it for the long haul. I\u2019m normally a cynic on bold announcements like this. I really hope I\u2019m proved wrong for the sake of anyone affected by dementia in the future.\u201dMr Cameron said the UK will look at how to bring forward specific proposals on drug patent extensions and how to give patients earlier access to new drugs.He said: \u201cWe are renewing our commitment to say by 2025 we want to find a cure to dementia. We should treat this as a disease rather than as some natural part of ageing.\u201cWe need to develop more drugs, we need to get those drugs to patients faster, we need more international collaboration and, crucially, we need more money into dementia research.\u201cWe are doubling, this year, the amount of money the British Government spends on dementia research to \u00a366m but we need other countries to do the same and to work together.\u201dHe added: \u201cSomething like \u00a350m a year is being spent on dementia research, rather than the \u00a3590m spent on cancer. It is important to see dementia as a disease and one that we need to understand more of so that we can tackle.\u201dHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt said more must be done to dispel the myth that dementia is an \u201cinevitable\u201d part of ageing.He said: \u201cThe UK Government is doing what we can. Since 2009 we have increased investment in dementia research from \u00a328m to \u00a352m and we are on target to increase research spending to \u00a366m by 2015. But globally we desperately need to see new investment flowing into dementia research.\u201cWe know from detailed analysis done by the London School of Economics that there is an impelling case both for economic and social viewpoints. That research shows that if treatment were available to delay the onset of dementia by just 36 months, it would save us here in the UK \u00a35bn per annum.\u201cCurrently few people understand what it takes to find a treatment and eventually a cure that works and is also safe. We know it is a fiendishly complicated process that is going to take co-ordination, investment, partnerships from across the many sectors and no doubt many failed attempts to get there.\u201cWe need innovation in finance to enable cutting-edge research as well as identifying and removing barriers that are currently stopping us achieving this.\u201dThe new world dementia envoy, Dennis Gillings, warned that if global leaders do not incentivise businesses to invest in research, the ambition to find a cure by 2025 will not be met.Dr Gillings said: \u201cDementia is a ticking bomb costing the global economy \u00a3350bn and yet progress with research is achingly slow. Research must become more attractive to pharmaceuticals so they will invest and innovate.\u201cJust as the world came together in the fight against HIV/Aids, we need to free up regulation so that we can test ground-breaking new drugs, and examine whether the period for market exclusivity could be extended. Without this radical change, we won\u2019t make progress in the fight against dementia.\u201d",

I do not have to keep looking down at the keyboard all the time, then forgetting what I am doing.I do find that these games are much more interesting then then television as I struggle at times to keep up with what is happening, then loose interest.I do think it's very important to remain as active as possible these days, and doing these games does help my brain on the days I am not out doing something else.I also find them very handy on long train journeys these days, as I no longer like long journeys any more, so it helps to pass the time.I do think ipads could play a major part in helping people with dementia remain active, and give them something to do on the days they are feeling low or lonely.So perhaps there needs to be a push in society to get these things out into the hands of those who could benefit from having them.",

I have been shouted at because the person thought, that once you get the illness you became deaf. Why on earth do people think this?I do think that there needs to be an open campaign, to educate people about dementia, so that they understand what dementia is, and what problems we may have.I feel very sorry for those who had dementia over the past 100 years or so,because many of these were put into mental hospitals, because the authorities thought that they were mad.Here again it us a total lack of understanding. But I am sure , that if we work hard enough at this we can remove the myths etc, and then remove the stigma we still see these days.Many people often say, you don't look as if you have dementia, so what does a person with dementia need to look like. This is a quite common remark and after a while it gets you.I have often gone out with my wife, and occassionally when she has stopped to speak to people, she gets asked, how is Ken?My wife's response is always the same, why not ask him yourself, he can speak and he is stood beside you.This again becomes quite hurtful after a while, because you feel like a ghost who is only visible to a few people.Let us all work together and remove this major problem",

Back in my teenage years I loved things like the Beatles, Cliff Richards and the Shadows, but also liked Classical music, something my father thought was odd at the time, because as he loved dancing he thought dance music was the best. I don't think he really understood why I liked classical music, and perhapsat that time thought I was a bit odd, however a few years later he himself started to listen to the same music as he found it relaxingHowever a lot of music we listen to during the day, is no good at night when you have any form of neurological illness like dementia.This is because the rhythm could cause many problems if its too fast or noisyI find this distressing to think I really enjoy a piece of music during the day, but if I wake up from some distressing graphic dream or nightmare, the same piece of music can actually make things much worseThere are lots of CDs on the market which claim to be relaxing, but many could add to the problems we already have, either because of the rhythm or other items on the musicThe reason I say this is because you can sometimes drift back off to sleep listening to music, but the wrong piece could cause nasty accidents if you are not carefulI heard one such CD during the day once and realised that it would not work at night, for the following reasonsIt had the sounds of the rivers which can be calming and relaxing along with the waves of the sea, something I enjoy during the day. But at night this could cause problems with a persons waterworks leaving them very embarrassed and upset. I have heard this from others so I am not going to put this one to the test.But sometimes fast music like violins can cause the brain to go hyper, if you are struggling from the horrors of the night as we call them, so music like this should be left to one side.These days I like to listen to relaxing classical or Cathedral choir music, as long as its not too heavy, along people like Andy Williams, Perry Como or Phil Coulter, which are all relaxing in their own way. The fact that I once met Andy Williams makes this extra special to me. But these are allset and a relaxing speed and rhythmI hope that one of these days someone will produce a cd of music for this purpose, because its something that is needed, and could be used in all environments.",

        "content": "When a person gets a diagnosis of dementia their whole world is thrown into chaos, as something's are lost for good, and things like tastes totally change.We are all brought up with beliefs and guidelines, but in many cases these also disappear as I have found over the last three years.In life we grow up with many ideas and in some cases strong beliefs, whether religious or not.I always had a strong belief in my religion until this illness started, then the wheels started to come off.I think its the way my brain has gone, but that is out of my control, on most days, as things change so much, and that is something that is distressing, whichever way it goes.However over the years my views on certain subjects have change quite a lot, and my tastes in foods have changed so muchthat its hard to accept that its the same person that I was 10 years ago.But my religion like many things have been pushed to the limit, and I am in the position now where I am not sure what I believe anymore. But I guess like my father its partly because of the way the religious authorities have changed things to suite themselves, the youngsters and have left the elderly and those with neurological illness etc out in the cold.I used to belong to a very old and large church which dated back to the year 880, and over the years was capable of holding up to 400-500 people, now its lucky if it gets anywhere near to half of that, simply because the clergy have lost touch, with reality and only seem to speak to their favourites.A few people have said recently that they feel as if they are going the same way because they cannot cope with being treated like idiots. I do think that the Church of England has lost the plot over the last few years, because its now run by academic Bishops, rather than Bishops who came up through the ranks and actually worked in industry earlier, people who knew the real meaning of life with its struggles and hardship, rather than going straight in from University.When I was younger Bishops were admired, they were tied to any political party and they stood up for the poor and the sick.Now that has all changed and they all seem to be tied to the Labour party and the sick and poor no longer get thought about. The Odd thing is that originally the Labour Party was set up for the workers on the mines and cotton mills, and the clergy were not invited to join.We now have a new Arch Bishop of Canterbury who has worked in industry, and he is trying to change things but like many other people I think he is fighting a losing battle, as the Church of England is now classed as a Middle to High Class religion, so no one else seems to matter any more. I guess that's because a lot of the old industries have gone from this country. No more coal fields, iron works, or cotton mills.But When I look back my father had the same problems, which at the time I did not understand, when we talked about it, but its becoming clear now, and I am starting to agree with him even though he is no longer with usFather had been a very religious man and went to church at least two or three time s every Sunday, and then he had a series of strokes, meaning that he could not attend church. He remembered the days when the clergy would visit the sick at home, but in his case they did not want to know, and classed outside visits as unnecessary, something which made him very upset, and in the end said his religion had gone.It was hard to listen to father when he talked about his religion and his wishes, at the end, but when I look at it I have gone exactly the same way. What is more I fully understood what he was getting at and I totally agree with him.I am now sadly getting to the same position, which is sad, but unavoidable. I struggle at church anyway these days as everyone is standing waving their arms around or swaying from side to side, something which makes me feel unstable, so I stopped going to certain services, but now each form of service changes every week, and that's no good when have memory problems and are trying to follow services   It feels like another chapter of the book is closing through this illness, but I guess that's life.My faith had kept me going up till now, but as one old Cannon once said you don't need to attend church to be religious, just keep your faith.I know that many other people with dementia have experienced the same problems in life, so I am not alone with this. One person actually lost a lot of friends for saying things like this, which to me is very sad because it proves that those who left this person knew nothing at all about this illness.When I look back over the years, so much has changed, my tastes in food, music, and even politics, so I wonder what is going to be next ",

After 6 months of waiting I was put through the diagnosis again, because my notes were still lost, but this was done in a far better way and more person centred and caring.After the diagnosis was done, I was given the information about the medication which I would be tried on, and also about the Lewy body dementia, and was then asked to go home with my wife, where we could read it all and return in two weeks to ask any questions that we may have.We were also told to ring the hospital if we had any questions which were very important.After the two weeks I was given the medication and was told to do one or two things which would help me over the next period,One was to set myself up a routine, so that life would be easier to control, and would ease the pressure on my wife.I was also told to write my life story, so that my family and any grand children would learn who I was and where I came from, if the illness progressed at a fast rate.As I was having graphic nightmares etc, I was also told to keep a diary, explaining what happened, as it would help the clinical psychologists understand more clearly.This got so bad that I could not find a diary big enough, so I started writing it down on the Internet, and that's how the blog started, all by accident.I say by accident, because I did not realise that this bog could be read by others.We were also told to go to the local branch of the Alzheimer's Society were we would get extra help and support.The sad thing is that many Alzheimer's Society Branches have now closed, so support of this nature is very hit and miss.However if you have a local branch it is well worth contacting them to ask questions, and also see if anyone can help and advise you.Charities can give a lot of positive advice so please look them up, and see if they can help you.There are many Internet chat rooms for this illness, but here again, not everyone is able to use the Internet to get this support.But many people do not get the support and help that I got, and I do think more help needs to be out there for what people call a very traumatic diagnosis.I also think that face to face support is far better than Internet support, as you can see the person.This information does not all need to be given on the day of diagnosis but can be given over a few weeks,so that we do not get swamped.I do think the information about the medication and illness was welcomed and gave us an idea as to what could happen, although, as I said before we are all vastly different.All individuals with individual problems symptoms and ways we deal with our problems.Having a support group would be ideal, so that we could ask other people with the illness how they coped with odd problems.Another way would be to have a dementia nurse who could answer questions we have.But I guess that it's all down to the hospital where this is done.Writing the blog helped me quite a lot, and through chat rooms I met many new virtual friends, who also gave help and support.I have spoken to many people after their diagnosis and their response has been amazing, as they all say the same. Talking to professionals is helpful, but speaking to someone who has the illness, has more of an effect, as they are talking face to face about how they are coping with the illness.No medical jargon, no big words, just saying it as it is.Let's hope that things change in the future so we get more support at the point of diagnosis.",

Both my wife and I had told these people that I had this illness, yet they totally dismissed our comments and went their own way.It seems that eye problems are quite common in Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's dementia which are I understand the same illness, so why are these people not trained to understand this, as it would save a lot of time as well as money.So let's hope that all opticians etc are trained in dementia etc in the future, so that our lives are made that little bit easier. Needless to say, I am now using my old distance and reading glasses again until my new glasses are made up.",

        "content": "Did you have parents who thoughtyou were an angel when you were a child?I wonder how many parents did think that their children weresweet and innocent, when they were small and thought butter would not melt intheir mouths so to speak.I was no little angel, and I know it.But since starting towrite my life story, I have had the time of my life looking back at times whenmy brain was working, and at times had a chuckle to myself.I was born in a small mining village on the edge of aNorthern Fell, covered in heather and bracken, and in some places it was very boggy. Those houses were very old withvery few amenities to speak of, Cold water and not hot, a tin bath which hungon the wall outside when it was not being used. An outside toilet which I would imagine was very cold inwinter. Possibly sitting with your feet up to ensure that no one could walk inwhen it was dark etc. I dread to think what happened if there was a bug goinground, with one outside toilet between four people. At one stage my mother said that they got worried, because some of their cutlery was disappearing, and could not be found. after searching behind the drawers and cupboards, my father looked at a split in the floor and noticed something shining. So with the help of a family member took the floor up to find the missing cutlery. The little angel had been exposed at an early age, I still don't know why I was pushing the cutlery into this crack in the floor, and my mother did not say anything until a few years before she died, after which we had a good laugh.I then heard many stories about my as a child, but these are not printable, but they had kept my mother amused over the years.When I was 5 years of age we moved to a new council run estatein the next town where we stayed until I was 11 years of age. In that time wegrew up fast, because there were bullies living everywhere, but that was lifeand you got on with it.We got used to playing football and cricket etc, in the darkafter school, which was interesting looking back, and would be banned by the healthand safety officials we see today, but it was fun and we were out of the way.This involved using dustbins as wickets for cricket, or someone's back gate, which caused some problems with neighbours.Or we would use our coats as goal posts for football, as we did not have modern day things like goal posts, but then who did.In those days everyone in the area played sports in the street girls and boys all got involved.  Our hobbies ranged from sports to train spotting as the maineast coast line ran past the front of our house so you never got bored, orswimming in the open air baths in the next town to use and that was bitter inautumn, but like fools we enjoyed it.One game we played atnight was knocky nine doors, a game where you picked a house in the darkness,crept up and then knocked on the doors before running at high speed to get awaybefore someone opened the door. We never picked a door where any elderly peoplelived as that was unfair, but usually some loud mouthed person who hatedchildren.However my mother always warned me against doing that,whether she knew I was doing it whether I always looked guilty I don\u2019t know.However my father went one better as a childYears later I heard that my father as a boy took this on toanother level. In those days the village houses had two doors, the back whicheveryone used, and the front which was there for special guests and certainlynot children.He was one of three boys in the familyThese three little or not so little boys caused havoc in their village at night,something I found very hard to believe after the way he told me to behave attimes later on in life. According to my father he was an angel?Outside their homes on one side were the fells vast openspaces, with animals grazing day and night, things like horses, pony\u2019s, andgoats.At the other side of the house was a small back yard, whichhoused the outside toilet and a small coal house where coal was kept for thefires.In those days the front door was never opened apart from admitting special guests, so everyone used the back doorMy father and brothers would creep up to someone\u2019s backdoor, where they would tie a horse, pony or goat to the door knocker. Afterwhich they would run round to the front door and knock on the door knocker,knowing full well that the back door would be opened first.When the unsuspecting person opened the door they would begreeted by the animal which was tied to the door knocker.The problem being that to untie the animal they had to openthe door first, which meant that the poor animal would be dragged into thehouse turned around and was then pushed out again, by the then very annoyedperson, who no doubt would be out on the streets looking for the terrible threesome. Their father my grandfather was a miner, and could lookafter himself as he was also what was called a street fighter as my uncle toldme, although he was also quite gentle to friends and children. Here again he was a very quiet family man.He was smallish to look at but was well known for taking ontwo people in one go and would win.He never suspectedthat his children did such things, and I guess that no one would argue withhim, because of who he was. But if he had suspected anything no doubt he wouldhave given the boys a good thrashing.When I heard these stories I realised that no matter what Igot up to on the council estate it was nothing compared to my elders.The only thing we did, which would have caused trouble if wehad been caught was throwing potatoes from the farmers field, at the trainguards van chimneys.In those days all goods trains had a guards van at the back,so that if the train broke down, the guard could put warning lights on thetrack to stop other trains hitting them. It also served anther purpose as a secondary break vehicle,if the train got too fast going downhill.These guards vans had a coal fire inside to keep the guardwarm in winter, and the chimney was collapsible for going under bridges. We picked up from older boys that if you hit the chimney andit collapsed onto the roof, the guard would come out thinking he had gone undera low bridge. At this point we would run as fast as we could or hide in aditch, until the train had gone, we never aimed anything at the guard or anyoneelse as that was out of the question even for us.Needless to say that when the chimney collapsed the guardsvan would became smoky inside, but the guard could pull it back up from insidethe guards van, without needing to stop.However we spent more time than enough sitting on the grassybank watching the trains and getting the numbers as they sped by. Other times we would just stand on the nearest bridge andget covered in smoke and steam as the train went underneath it. That wasmarvellous as these trains were real living monsters and we adored them, andstill do.Looking at this anyone would think I grew up in a family of thugs, but far from it, these were people who grew up in mining villages and had to look after themselves and their families, so that bullies could never hopefully take advantage of them. All big church people and all well respected by all.Its amazing just how much you can dig up from your past, many things that were possibly hidden out of view, but were totally natural at the time.",

They lost their rights and civil liberties when they were attacked so why should convicts get away with this, because like it or not they gave up their rights to civil liberties.I know that my life is all over Google, but that was because I chose to stand up and talk about living with dementia, and if I write a blog or stand up and speak in public, then I am exposing myself to public anyway.As far as many people with dementia are concerned, they lost their civil liberties when they were diagnosed, as they are going to need support for the rest of their lives, but this does not stop them getting on with their lives, nor in many cases do they wish to hide it, it's part of their lives and they accept it and move on. They have done nothing to attract this illness yet they have accepted the inevitable.So is it time to review this civil liberties law and use it only to protect the innocent.",

It never occurred to me that cats were allowed in mosques.Another problem came when we were out and needed the toilet, only to be confronted by a hole in the ground.I have problems with balance most days so thus caused some problems, especially when we were on a ferry crossing into the other side of Turkey. No one said that they had disabled toilets.Times like this are frightening although afterwards you can sit back and have a laugh.This is a different culture vastly different to what we are used to, but it's interesting to see all the same. I was using my stick for balance most of the time, so the traders kept well clear of me, unless I slipped, then they would step forward to see if I was alright.The first hotel was a bit of a nightmare as part of the ground floor was lifted for refurbishment, and it was covered in cardboard. This meant that the steps were bigger than normal and the handrails were not attached at the bottom.This took some getting used to and I thought the hotel should never have been used at all for safety reasons.The travel agent with us tried to say that the work had only just started, but it was obvious that it had been going on for months, so we will be taking this up with the company later.All in all it was a nice holiday especially seeing the differences between the east and west Turkey.",

        "content": "After having around a year of eye tests, and now finding that things are no different, I started to look for more information, and today I found this sheet on the Alzheimer's Societies web site.I now know that these problems are caused by the illness, and by copying this web page I hope it helps others This factsheet considers some specific visuoperceptual difficulties that people with dementia can have,and possible ways of helping them.Understanding potential perceptual problems and intervening withappropriate help, support and reassurance can greatly assist people with dementia to feel safe in theirchanging perceived reality.People with dementia can experience a number of visuoperceptual difficulties due to normal ageing,eye conditions, and sometimes from additional damage to the visual system caused by specific typesof dementia.Vision difficulties can result in a variety of 'visual mistakes' (including illusions, misperceptions,misidentifications and sometimes even hallucinations).They can cause a person with dementia tomisinterpret their environment and what is in it. The consequences of such difficulties can be moresevere for people with dementia than for people without, since they may not know (or remember) thatthey are making 'visual mistakes', or be rational or able to 'test reality' accurately. They may also havedifficulty explaining what they have seen.Visuoperceptual difficulties have been reported for a number of dementias including Alzheimer'sdisease, dementia related to Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and vascular dementia (ifstroke-type damage is on or near to the visual pathway in the brain). Of the various types of dementia,the visual difficulties in Alzheimer's disease have been most studied to date.Visual perception is complex since, whether people have good vision or not, they try to interpret andunderstand what they see. Sometimes trying to understand what was 'poorly seen' involves making a'best guess' at what was seen. If what we perceive seems real to us, it can directly affect ourbehaviour.Accurate perceptionAlthough 'vision' usually refers to seeing with the eyes, and 'perceiving' refers to making sense of theinformation that the eyes (and the other senses) are receiving, the two words are often usedinterchangeably.To perceive accurately requires the ability to co-ordinate all the components of the visual system(eyes, optic muscles, retinas, optic nerve) and process information from other senses and thoughts. Italso depends on overall health of the body, visual system and brain, alertness, mood, motivation and1even the expectation of what 'should' be seen. Accurate vision also requires the co-ordination of everyaspect of our cognitive (thinking) ability to manage and make sense of visual information (Jones G MM et al, 2006a).There are many components to vision: adjusting and maintaining optimal focus; adjusting to differentlight levels; perceiving depth of field, black and white, colour, lines, objects, faces; distinguishingbetween faces; separating objects from background; making the accurate small eye movementsrequired to follow moving objects and scan information. There are also many possible types andcombinations of visual difficulties.Advances in the neuroscientific understanding of normal vision are helping to better understand visualchanges resulting from ageing, use of medication, illness or injury, and specific types of dementia.Normal age-related changes in visionVisual changes resulting from normal ageing can include:. reduced visual acuity (sharpness - nearby objects become blurred first). an increase in the amount of light needed to see. an increase in the negative effects of glare. more time required to adapt to marked changes in light level (from dark to light or vice versa). a reduction in size of the peripheral visual field. decreased contrast sensitivity. decreased depth perception. changed colour vision (increased colour saturation required to see colours - gradual loss of theblue/violet part of the colour spectrum - dark colours and pastel shades become increasinglydifficult to distinguish between). changes in the small eye movements (used to track moving objects, orientate oneself in newlocations, and to read). blurring from 'floaters' (clumps of cellular debris in the vitreous humour gel in the eye). light flashes or momentary distortion of images (when vitreous humour in the eye begins topull away from the retina). decreased ability to perceive the flickering of strobe lighting.Most people have regular sight tests and adjust automatically to their changing vision as they getolder. They can use glasses, accurately problem-solve, or learn to compensate for visual changes.However, people with dementia, increasingly, may not be able to do this.Illnesses, drugs and medications can affect visionAs well as the effects of normal ageing on the visual system, a number of visual disorders arecommonly associated with ageing. These include cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration andretinal complications from diabetes. These can all result in changes such as blurring, partial loss ofvisual field, through to genuine visual hallucinations and complete blindness.Use of alcohol and other recreational drugs can also affect vision, as can withdrawal from them.2Sometimes medications can cause or contribute to visual difficulties. A surprising number ofmedications commonly taken by older people can have visual side-effects. They include some drugsfrom the following categories: cardiovascular, non steroidal anti-inflammatory, antibiotics,anti-Parkinson, and even eye medications.Additional visual difficulties in some types of dementiaThere can also be additional visuoperceptual difficulties in dementia related to Parkinson's diseaseand Lewy body dementia. In vascular dementia, if strokes occur along or near the visual pathway, awide range of visuoperceptual difficulties, including hallucinations, can result. Importantly, changes invision from strokes may not be noticed by an individual.Currently, most is known about damage to the visual system in Alzheimer's disease (and 'posteriorcortical atrophy', a rare variant of Alzheimer's disease, see Factsheet 479). The 'plaque and tangle'damage which characterises Alzheimer's disease, initially accumulates in the brain areas linked tomemory for processing new factual information. It lies close to a part of the visual pathway, which canalso become affected from the spread of plaque and tangles. Later, other parts of the visual pathwaycan also be involved. Difficulties in both primary and complex visual functioning have been describedfor Alzheimer's disease. (Note that some of these are similar to those described for normal ageing.However they can occur independently from, or in addition to, normal age-related visual changes andvisual illness.)Specific difficulties that have been reported in Alzheimer's disease include:. reduction in number and accuracy of small eye movements. colour perception (loss of the blue, purple, green part of the spectrum). figure-background contrast discrimination. depth and motion perception. visual acuity (but not initially). object and facial recognition.Some noticeable consequences of such problems include difficulties with:. assembling puzzles. reading books, or doing visual tasks involving close eye movements. watching TV shows with rapidly moving images.Less obvious difficulties may involve the ability to:. play board games. keep handwriting in horizontal lines. find objects readily (even though they may be in front of a person). copy images accurately. walk or mobilise confidently.Evidence for the types and range of visual difficulties that can occur comes from special types of sight3testing and scans, from people's accounts of their own difficulties, and from careful observations of thevisual errors repeatedly made. These include such things as:. difficulty re-adjusting one's spatial orientation when moving around (even in familiarenvironments like walking in one's own neighbourhood). difficulty driving when rapidly changing information needs to be analysed and accuratelyresponded to. difficulty judging the height of the floor when the colour flooring changes (colour illusions,figure-background and depth of field difficulties can make surfaces difficult to judge). high-stepping over carpet rods or shadows, thinking they signify a change of level. difficulty problem solving visual illusion effects (for example, when going downstairs -determining how many steps there are, and where the next one is; going upstairs is notusually a problem). resisting walking on shiny flooring because it looks wet or slippery. walking on the darkest patterns (or shadows) of flooring to try to avoid falling. misinterpreting reflections in mirrors, windows or shiny surfaces (refusal to go into a toiletbecause reflections make them appear to be occupied; fear of an 'unknown person who keepsdisappearing' being present). mistaking TV images for real people ('little people') because they are brighter and more visiblethan a TV console located against a dark background. inability to find a particular item (eg handbag, clothing) even though the item is in front of aperson and appears to be in their field of vision (this can make it difficult even to locatesomeone's hand to be able to return a handshake).. difficulty in locating people or objects because of other distracting or competing visualinformation (such as patterned wallpaper).. difficulty in positioning oneself accurately to sit down in a chair, on the bed, on the toilet(difficulty estimating depth of field, especially if the objects are behind a person, out of view;some people make multiple checks but still have difficulty and may even try to straddle themfrom the front. Note that such difficulty may be mistaken for incontinence). inability to find objects or places because of a lack of colour contrast (for example, not seeingthere is cauliflower and pasta on a white plate, or not seeing doors painted the same colour asthe walls). restlessness from visually over-stimulating environments (eg too many shiny Christmasdecorations in some care settings that can mask important orientation cues).As seen from the examples above, visual difficulties can affect many aspects of a person's dailyfunctioning. If people with dementia are living in their own home with carers who are helping them, thereal extent of their visual difficulties may not be apparent until they experience a change inenvironment, like going out shopping, on an outing, or on holiday.Visual difficulties and 'perceived obstacles' can make a person more fearful of falling, and slow downtheir movements while they try to walk safely. If carers and companions understand this, they can tryto anticipate situations which will likely pose perceptual difficulties, help explain what is beingencountered, offer their arm for support, offer encouragement, and slow down their own movementsaround a person with dementia.4Categories of visual mistakesWith improved neuroscientific understanding of the visual system, it is possible to categorise differenttypes of visual mistakes. Some examples are listed below. Although hallucinations are perhaps thebest known, recent research (Jones G M M et al, 2006b) suggests they may be rarer than previouslythought because other categories of visual mistakes have not previously received much attention.Illusions - a 'distortion of reality' resulting from some physical property or characteristic of the image(reflection, shiny or bright surface, poor figure/background contrast, timing of presentation, etc).Example: a person mistook the distorted reflection of a doorstop in a cylindrical, shiny, stainless steelbin, for there being a 'mouse in the bin'.Misperceptions - a best guess at inaccurate, degraded or distorted visual information (usually as aresult of damage to the visual system). Misperceptions can be influenced by motivation, previousexperience and expectation.Example: a dark stain on the carpet was mistaken for a rat.Example: walking down a long, dark corridor with benches along the wall resulted in a person withdementia thinking she was at a train station.Misperceptions of illusions - what is already incorrectly seen, may be seen as even more distortedby a damaged visual system.Example: a gentleman who approached a lift that had three large mirrors in it, mistook himselfreflected three times for a crowd of people who would not move to allow him in.Misidentifications (agnosias) - incorrectly identifying objects and people resulting from damage tospecific locations of the visual cortex.Example: a gentleman tried to use the black remote control for the TV to shave with.Example: a mistaken thought that a large statue of a dog was real resulted in food being thrown at itdaily.Example: inability to distinguish accurately between a son, husband, and brother.Misnaming what has been seen (or assumed to be present) - this can result from difficulties toretrieve the nouns and words to describe what is being seen accurately, or from making timeperception errors and using tenses inaccurately.Example: A collection of metal zimmer frames piled up at the end of the corridor was referred to as'the robots'.Example: A lady who was severely disoriented in time thought her children were still young and livingat home. She cautioned her husband as he walked past their old bedroom door, to 'be quiet so youdon't wake the children'.Hallucination - seeing something when there are no cues for it in the outside world. It is an internallyproduced visual image experienced with the eyes open. Sometimes people are aware that what isbeing seen is not present in the outside world, and they can stop it at will. Others may not be aware itis not real and cannot stop it at will. There are many different types of visual hallucinations.Genuine visual hallucinations can result from urinary, chest or other type of infection, other illness, or areaction to medication (see Factsheet 520, Hallucinations in people with dementia). They have alsobeen more associated with Lewy body dementia, than other types of dementia. This should beconsidered if other causes of visual difficulties or hallucinations have been eliminated or treated, andvisual hallucinations persist. (See Factsheet 403, What is dementia with Lewy bodies?)5Interventions for visuoperceptual difficultiesThe increased understanding of visual mistakes is generating new ideas for assisting people withdementia.Careful attention to eye care and visual health. Check that any glasses worn are clean and that the prescription is correct. (For moreadvanced dementia, this may require use of special non-verbal tests as for people withlearning difficulties.). Arrange for regular eye checks.. Encourage the person to wear glasses if they need them. Glasses will improve acuity(sharpness) of what is being seen; however, glasses cannot correct difficulties resulting fromother types of damage to the visual system.. If cataracts are the cause of, or contributing to, poor sight, talk to a GP about how to havethem treated.Environmental adaptationsAiding specific visual functions can help people with dementia (Jones et al, 2008). The first thing to dois to improve lighting levels. It has been estimated that more than half of British homes do not haveenough lighting even for ordinary visual purposes (Whitfield Grundy, 1992). Improved lighting hasbeen found to be instrumental in preventing falls, and also in reducing visual hallucinations (Pankow etal, 1996).Deliberate use of colour cues can also help significantly. For example, one study with people withadvanced Alzheimer's disease showed that changing to highly visible red cups and plates led to a 25per cent increase in food intake and an 84 per cent increase in liquid consumption (Dunne et al, 2004).Brightly coloured toilet doors have also been used successfully in a variety of care settings to helppeople with dementia find the toilet independently, and more readily.High contrast toilet seats (compared to the colour of the toilet fixtures and walls) can make it easier tolocate them. If a person needs handrails choose extra-long ones so that they are as conspicuous aspossible (without the person having to turn their head to look for them).Some tips for minimising visuoperceptual problems. Provide good, even lighting (people resist going near dark areas in corridors and rooms).. Try to eliminate shadows.. Minimise busy patterns on walls and flooring.. Use of non-shiny, light-coloured flooring will reflect light upwards and enhance overall ambientlight levels.. Remove or replace mirrors and shiny surfaces if they are problematic.. Highlight important object and visual cues (signposting/orientation points).. Camouflage objects that you do not want to emphasise (eg light switches or doors that peoplewith dementia shouldn't use).6. Minimise 'visual obstacles/barriers' such as changes in floor surfaces or patterns, to assistindependent walking.. Choose activities to match the person's visual abilities.For information about a wide range of dementia-related topics and details of Alzheimer's Societyservices in your area visit alzheimers.org.ukUseful organisationDementia and Sight Loss Interest GroupAlzheimer's Society, RNIB and the Thomas Pocklington Trust have created the Dementia and SightLoss Interest Group.

Sadly she passed away and was a great loss not just to the humans but also Ben our Labrador cross dog.Ben had his own problems with his nerves and did not like loud noises, something that I was able to understand, when my own hearing became acute due to the Lewy body dementia.But Ben would follow me closely when I was being diagnosed, and never let me out of his sight.Although this was nice, it also drove me mad at times, because if I went to the bathroom, he would be sat out side the door when I came out.When I was on my own at times I would lie of the couch downstairs so I could lie flat, and occasionally I would wake up to find him snuggled up along side me, then he would disappear as if he was embarrassed to be found there.We wondered if it was to help me feel secure or whether he thought I needed support, or he was keeping me warm, something we will never knowHe would do the same if I was extremely tired and went to lie on the bed for a rest, he would be there as soon as my eyes were closed.When I had problems seeing things during the day like hallucinations, I knew it was just my brain because he could not see anything, so I felt safe. This helped me to cope in the early days.Even if I was up during the night with my bad dreams and nightmares, he would get out of his bed and sit by my feet, until I went back to bed.After the diagnosis it became apparent that something was wrong with him so we took him to the vets, where we were told that he was ill and they would need to do some tests.This was distressing for me as we had become so attached. We were then told that his liver had started to fail, and it would be better to put him out of his misery as he would have been struggling.The odd thing was that after I had retired we had walked miles together and kept each other company, during the long days of the diagnosis, he was walking slower but always along side me.After talking to the vet later she told me something which left me in tears, because it was so moving, and as she said was possibly very true.That was that Ben had been ill for over two years but it had not been obvious to us, but once I had been diagnosed, he simply gave up the will to carry on.In other words he knew I was ill and looked after me, until I was diagnosed and on medication,I had been in the medication for around 6 months and was starting to see things a bit clearer when he died.I never got over this, as he had been a close companion for nearly a year during the diagnosis, never letting me out of sight, unless my wife was around. How can anyone say that animals are dumb and don't understand.I cannot have another dog now because it would tear my apart now if anything happened.Life would be different without our furry friends, bless them",

        "content": "When this illness kicked in I was devastated, as all of my electrical experience was disappearing fast.I often wonder where all of this stuff disappears to, as it gave spoken to other people who still remember how to do their jobs, yet mine is virtually goneI was a university college engineer, and spent most of my time doing electrical work, and my son took a great interest in my job, apart from the paperwork and decided early on to follow suite.I often talk to my son, who became an electrician after watching me at work, and he has talked about my job and the things I once did, like retiring the college chapel, yet here I am unable to fit a 13 amp plug these days.Having someone like Mark to talk to too, is helpful, but also distressing wondering what happened to wipe so much information from my memory. Sometimes odd bits come back, which I try to fit into place, but that's it.After my diagnosis, I occasionally picked up my last electrical exam papers, in the hope that something would click into place, but no such luck. It's as if a virus has hit my computer and wiped it clean. Trying to read the exam papers is like trying to read a foreign language, and nothing makes any sense at all.Looking back I could and did spend hours working on electrical equipment, which as Mark has said was something I enjoyed doing, getting something to work all over again when it had died, yet these days, there is not a spark anywhere.Having him around at times helps me to understand what I did at work, and in some respects it helps me fill in some of the holes, but not a lot. I often wonder why some people remember their jobs in great detail where others are at a loss to know where to start.Mark often went into work with me at weekends when I was on call for breakdowns, and it was thus that made him interested in becoming an electrician rather than going to university, so in some respects he has picked up where I appear to have stopped.I often look at my old diaries of the problems I faced at the start if this illness, trying to work out what was going wrong, and it feels like I am at times reading someone else's diaries, certainly nothing to do with me, yet it was me and I was going through the horrors of losing my memories and job all in one go.Perhaps it's time to just let go and throw these things away, so I ca no longer be tempted to try and work these things out.",

        "content": "I know that many of us struggle to cope with dementia, but many also struggle with the extra problems like very graphic nightmares and dreams.Looking at this from a new angle, I do wonder how many people have lived in war zones before this illness, or through other nightmares in life which could come back and have a serious impact on our lives later, like these graphic nightmares.Many people had problems with being bullied or were abused in younger times, and had no one to turn to for support and help.These are I suppose some of the things which could have a serious effect later in life, and come back to haunt us.Many of these things could either have been blocked out of the memory for one reason or another, or simply pushed to one side, as they are difficult to cope with, when the support is not there.But with all of the graphic media attention these days, these things are coming back to haunt many people, and when the brain is not functioning as it used to do, it is harder to block out.I do wonder why the press do this, but they obviously never consider those who may have been affected by these problems.I know that when I was diagnosed the second time, and talked about these graphic nightmares and dreams, it was something that the clinical psychologist spoke about.Every time the news is on these days it's violence or conflict on one or other country, or wall to wall coverage of sex abuse etc, and it's harder for many to cope with because of the saville inquiry these days.When we look back to the 1960s etc, there was little or no support, and if you were abused by someone that was well known by the family, and as many have said, no one would ever believe there side of the story.Many have spoken about being beaten by family members, after trying in vain to report the abuse, because it was called fairy tales, lies or just imagination.Yet we are see these poor people on television every day, complaining that no one believed themThe Catholic Church had problems also and that is still rumbling on, and many people have not even had apologies or acknowledgements from the authorities.Even these days people complain about the total lack of support, so it's possible that these things could come back and haunt people later in life.Perhaps one of these days it will all fit into place, and people will feel happier, but the guilt and fear may still exist in their memories for years, and may well come back like childhood memories when dementia strikes.That is a real fear, fear that they were to blame not the abusers or bullies, and it's possible that this will torment them right up to the end.",

        "content": "I have often wondered how you are supposed to keep fit when you havedementia.I was once told by one doctor at home that I was overweight, and should dosomething about it.So after a few weeks of wondering what to do, I was referred to the localgym.However this was to be short lived, as the instructors knew very littleabout their roles, let alone dementia.I went for my induction, and was told to be careful, in following all of thegiven advice, but has this young lady really been listening when my wifeexplained that I had dementia, obviously not.The next day I turned up, and was going to speak to the instructors, whowere there that day, but guess what, there was no one available.So I carefully checked the scribbled notes I had written, and got started.Eventually I came to the tread mill, and looked at it carefully. The problembeing that people with dementia or neurological illnesses know that they don'talways see the obvious.I pressed the button on the machine, and had to run extremely fast, buteventually fell off the back of the machine. I stopped the machine, got back onand the same thing happened again. Suddenly from nowhere an instructor appeared and gave me a rocket formucking around. I tried to explain my problem but she simply walked away andignored my comments.I felt to shocked at this that I walked out and never went back, although Idid complain to the local council who owned the gym, but never got a reply.My answer to this was and is that Durham County Council was never and willnever be Dementia a Friendly when they have this attitude.Previously to this I used to swim, but now my coordination, has gonecompletely, because when I am swimming and move my arms, and now my mouth opensat the wrong time, so hey presto, I swallow more water than enough.So how can anyone use these facilities when they have dementia and thestaff, really do not care?In the end I started walking, because in enjoy it and can do this at my ownspeed.I remember when I used to cycle and through my son we did the Coast to Coastcycle ride of around 140 miles, this was extremely hard work, but these days asI have hip, problems, so I would never get onto a bike, let alone cycle anydistance on it.When doctors refer you to these places I do wonder if they have any realidea what will happen.Looking back some of this is funny to me now, but it certainly was not atthe time.",

        "content": "Brought out each year, so I can remember what I wrote about raising awarenessIt\u2019stime to start our yearly campaign to raise awareness of dementia, and as I amaway on holiday at the time of this event, I am trying to, do everything I canbefore we go awayDementia isan illness that no one wants, and it\u2019s something very few really understand,because we don\u2019t know what causes it.Many of uslose friends once we get the diagnosis, and that is very hard to accept, butmost of this is caused by pure ignorance of the illness Many people refuseto accept the diagnosis when it is given, and then refuse help.Some peoplehave said that family members refuse to accept the diagnosis, and even try tosay that there is nothing visibly wrong with the person who has the illness.This is something which can go on to cause more stress to the person withdementiaMany assumethat everyone with dementia is the same, yet we are all individuals, onindividual journeys, so no two people with any form of the illness have thesame symptoms or problems.Dementiacovers a vast array of types of the illness, and as I was once told by aconsultant, there are well over 120 variations of dementia, and no matter whatanyone else says no two people go down the same route with the same symptoms,something which is difficult to grasp.This illnessis very difficult to cope with at times, because we lose control of our lives,sometimes losing our careers, our hobbies, and past times, our friends, and astime goes by things like driving go by the boardYes we may lookas if we have nothing wrong on the outside, but we are starting to lose controlof our brain, and this is difficult to grasp and understand when it happens Many GeneralPractitioners don't really understand dementia let alone know how to diagnoseit, and therefore we need to have more training in the dementia awarenesscampaign.But not justtraining for doctors, but all medical staff, along with all those in the publicservices, police fire brigade and ambulance services, so they can understandthat when someone gets agitated in a strange like a hospital or an ambulance,it could be an illness like dementia and not something like drink, drugs orpure violence.How can that work. Surely weneed trained professionals trained within the NHS and in industry these days.We also needall care home staff to be given formal training, and qualifications before theyare given a job in a care home. This issomething that the National Institute for Clinical Excellence should push forand make it mandatory, so there is no excuse for abuse or mistreatment.Many of usalso do talks to trainee Nurses, Doctors and Social Workers at Universities andthis work must carry on if we are to succeed in getting this illness morerecognition, and also get standards raised, so they all understand what ourlives are live on a daily basis.People withdementia can have an important role in all of this, by going out and beingallowed to speak to staff in hospitals and care homes.I have spokento many student Nurses at training events and lectures etc., and it\u2019s not thefirst time I have spoken at an event only to be told afterwards that thestudents had learnt more from us, than they did in a lecture. If that isthe case \u201cwhere are the text books coming from\u201d, and are they up to date.We should ensure that each person in ahospital or care home is treated with the same dignity and respect, that wewould all expect from other people and nothing short of that will do. Anyone whodoes not understand that, must be in the wrong job and should get out beforethey are thrown out, or cause major problems.I am notalone with this, as many are not given the dignity and respect they deserve. TREATUS WITH THE SAME DIGNITY AND RESPECT THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM OTHERS. I am surethat if many hospital staff and care staff were treated with the same lack ofrespect they would indeed be the first to complainBut when ithappens to people with dementia, it\u2019s a case of they don\u2019t understand so why botherWhen we getthis message through we may start to get somewhere, as we hear far too manycases of people with this illness being abused in care homes and hospitalsthese days, something which in my view is a backward step not a forward one aswe would all expect in this centuryI know thatmoney is short in the health service, but to me it\u2019s spent on the wrong thingsby the wrong people, time and time again. I do thinkit\u2019s time to change the standards and bring back hospital Matrons, as they knowwhat\u2019s needed and are more in control than some pen pusher, who was brought into run the hospital, but has never done a day\u2019s work inside a proper hospital. StigmaHowever oneof the main reasons we wish to raise awareness of dementia, is that we all liveon hope, that we can in our own little way go a long way to remove the stigmawhich we hear of every day in dementia.To removethis, we must educate everyone about this illness, starting with schoolchildren, who in many cases are more alert to the illness and want to learnmore. Many ofthese children know of someone in their own families who has the illness, andthey in turn want to find out how they can help this person live a normal lifewhere possible. Years agothis would have been thought of as unhealthy and wrong, but children these daysare more open and honest about illnesses like dementia, and in many cases havebeen found to be more caring and thoughtful than adults, because they do nothold grudges, and do not think of these illnesses as barriers.My owngrandchildren know that I have dementia although to them its old timers, andalthough they are still very young, they are more helpful and thoughtful thanmany adults I have come across these days. Thesechildren know that I struggle, and they do not make me look silly or treat meas such, but in their own way they coax me through problems and help me when Iget stuck.It amazes meat times how these children sense that there is a problem and they never go,until the problem is resolved. Yes this isall down to their parents, but this proves that it can be done.They weretaught about my problems at an early age, and even the youngest child learntfrom the eldest, without any adult getting in the waySo why notstart in schools and then spread out.Today we arehearing more and more about dementia friendly communities, and places of work,and this is a brilliant start, but we must not allow this to stop, because thatwill mean that we have failed to do the one thing we set out to do and that itremoving this stigma.I do feelthat once we get to grips with this, we in turn will educate others that thisis not as many think a \u201ccontagious illness\u201d.Once we getthrough with this message we will be on track to remove the stigma we seetoday, and that will be brilliant for all who have the illness.During thenext few weeks we will be seeing more and more information on the internetabout the coming Dementia Awareness week, so I would encourage all who have aninterest to go out and help us with this campaign.However there are many misconceptions about Dementia.Thatthis illness is age related? Therewell over 16,000 people under the age of 65 who have this illness, some intheir 30s.Peopleassume that everyone with dementia is the same, to coin the old phrase. I haveseen one person with dementia so I know it all.Peoplewith dementia cannot speak, or take an active part?Peoplewith dementia are unable to get involvedPlease remember that thesepeople may not say a lot, but their actions speak volumes. I always remember seeingpeople with Alzheimer\u2019s disease at meetings, they rarely said much, perhaps dueto pressure of getting things right in their minds.In some cases their wives orfamily spoke up for them, without thinking and allowing the person time tospeak for themselves. But their actions did all ofthe answering, nodding, smiling or giving a thumbs up in agreement, or shakingtheir heads or hands when they disagreed. They still had feelings,ideas, of what was happening, and what is more they still have a sense ofpurpose and the meaning of life, along with that small word with a big meaning HOPE.These are all things whichhelp keep this horrible stigma which is attached to dementia alive.And please remember that we ask only for thefollowing Treatus with the same dignity and respect that you expect from others, and nothingless",

I got over this by using voice activated software on my computerBut this has also caused accidents at home when doing DIY projects, because my left hand got into many places it should never have gone, ending with burns and cuts.This is a hazard which I find very hard to cope with at times, and has meant that many hobbies etc, are now something in the past, never to be tried again.Obviously this is all down to changes in the brain, although it does not help me.It now means that when I wish to do something, I have to try to think first, but this problem is easier said than done, because I do not always remember to think things through.After being an Engineer for 30 years, I now find that I am in the position where I can no longer make decisions where my own safety is concerned, and that is something which quite frightening.All part of a brain which is disappearing.",

During the week I walked to school with oneGrandchild or the other as both girls are in different schools.However I do feel that it\u2019s so nice when they hang on to your hand and talkto you, while you walk them to school, although I confess that at times it wasvery hard to take, and sometimes get emotional.One day my daughter Claire had to take one daughter straight into town fromschool, to get her feet measured.As things were going to be tight, I agreed to pick the other granddaughterup from school, so that my wife could keep an eye on the grandson who was stillvery young at the time and got into everything when you were not lookingSo she asked if I would be alright, going up to the school to pick up theyoungest from the primary school which is about 1 1/2 miles away.I have walked this route on many occasions, and enjoy the walk, as it isrelaxing, so I agreed to do it.Having got to the school, I waited as everyone came out, and the teacherlooked at me and asked who I was waiting for, and I explained.I had seen my granddaughter wandering round the classroom, but she was inher own little world, and perhaps because she had not seen her mum she did notcome out.She asked where everyone was, and I explained as we were walking home.On the way I asked what she had been doing at school and whether she hadenjoyed herself.She was quiet at first, but then started talking about spellings, and howshe sometimes gets things wrong or spelt the wrong way, as some words sounddifferently to the way they are spelt.I said that I loved spelling when I was at school, but these days I cannotalways remember how words are spelt ( and without spell check) I would not bedoing this, although sometimes spell check cannot fathom out the words I amtrying to spell) so I am stuck. These days I have to break each word down,until I get an idea of the correct spellingShe looked up at me and said. But Grampy you have an excuse as you have oldtimers?I confess that I was taken aback by this and felt very tearful as thislittle girl of five had remembered this, and I felt very humbled that she wasbeing so thoughtful in what she said, and for someone 5 year old that takessome imagination.We had a long talk going home, and after she had changed out of her schooluniform, she came back downstairs and started talking again, sounding so oldfor her age. As Claire has said on many occasions she is 5 year old, yet thereare times she sounds more like 35.I had trouble trying to explain this to my wife and Claire, because I wasstill close to tears, the effect had been something I had never expected, as itwas so spontaneous.So it proves that children can understand more about this illness that weaccept, and possible think more about it than adults.Over the last two years things have got much worse, but these children havekept up with me, and always show a lot of care and respect.Over recent days I have been getting confused with people\u2019s names and todayI kept calling one grandson by the wrong name.He is only four and a half, in the end he turned to me, looked me straightin the face and said, don\u2019t worry Grampy ,you have old timers, so we understandthat your memory is not working as it should be.I understand when you call me by the wrong name.How can you answer that, when someone that age says things like that?This has proved one thing to me and that is this. The sooner we are able todiscuss this illness with youngsters the better, as they certainly seem to havea way of accepting the truth were adults cannotSo one way or another we need to start educating children when they are atschool as these youngsters will help us remove the stigma in the future, andthey will help educate others as they go.There have been many instances where they have done and said things whichare amazing but sadly this all disappears into the past, sometimes never to beremembered ever again.Through all of this the eldest Granddaughter who has Asperger\u2019s, is the mostprotective, and tells the other two what they can and cannot say or do.So with all of her own problems she really cares and hangs on to me all ofthe time.I really fear for her when my illness comes to its conclusion, because as Clairehas said, she will be hit the worst, we have formed an inseparable bond,something that no one can fully understand, but we get on so well, even thoughshe has her own problems.",

        "content": "There is a lot of work going on to make the country more dementia friendly, but this is also causing a lot of trouble as many people with dementia feel, that dementia is being used by this government for political reasons.Many wonder if this is just another government target which must be met?I think this is just something pushed out by Mr Cameron for his own purposes, and does not really achieve very much.It may make us more aware of dementia, but there is a danger that after taking this training, you assume wrongly, that you understand everyone who has the illness.I have done a lot of work raising awareness of dementia, and have done dementia champions training, although if I am honest I did wonder why I did it, because I think I knew more about the illness than the trainer. I think this is what people are complaining about, when I have asked, because they realise that the trainers,are unable to answer basic questions about the illness.Many of these trainers are not properly trained as far as dementia is concerned, and this raises many eyebrows, in society and business todayI have worked with dementia charities for a few years and have been totally shocked at the lack of knowledge their staff have when it comes to this subject, or they think they have heard about dementia, so we are all the same?I know that many people claim to know everything about dementia, including many in these front line charities, but then they make silly mistakes, which make many with the illness feeling angryand annoyed.Many of these charities think that everyone with dementia is the same, with the same symptoms and problems. But they are not they are, as a leading professor said, we are all individuals on individual journeys.I know that there may be around 10 types of dementia, but as I was told by a professor in Dementia, there are well over 120 variations and that is climbing every day, so noone can know it all, but they should at least have some good training before being let loose on societyIt is my own opinion that this training should be done by qualified trainers, and not as many say ex graduates in their first job. The reason being that Dementia is a sensitive illness, and should be treated as such. However one thing has puzzled me for some time, and that is the use or should I say the lack of use of people living with the illness. Many people with dementia have had tobe trained as dementia champions, even though they are living with the illness, and in many cases knew far more about the illness than the trainers. This does make many wonder what is going on, because we should be using people with the illness to explain our problems, not using others, who have little or no real idea about what its like to live with dementia.No matter how many events I speak at, I always hear the same things, and that is this. We can listen to all of theprofessionals speak about dementia at events, but you always get a better picture from someone who is  living with the illness, as it comes straight from the heart. Warts and all.So why don't charities use these people as they do in Scotland and other major countries around the world these days.I think the answer is that they would rather use their chief executive or well known personalities, who may well have had a father or mother with the illness, rather than use someone with first hand knowledge of the illness ie, a person who has it. They think in their wisdom that these people have a bigger impact that someone living with the illnessThis leads myself and many others to believe that we are only there to be used, as and when it is necessary after which we are hidden from view, as if we were not good enough.I have spoken to many businesses and was always shocked when they told me that they had been trained  to deal with dementia, yet they had a better response from staff, when it was done by someone with the illness later on.Most of these comments come back to the same thing, and that is, the training they were given, could have been done better.If they want dementia training they wanted it from someone with a good knowledge of what it is like to live with the illness. I use our bank mostweeks and the staff have told my wife, that after I spoke to them at one event, they know what to look for in others, or at least have a better idea. By watching me they have learnt more about this illness and have abetter of what to watch forSo is this dementia friendly training really working?I do hope that this does work, as we need to do something positive, in raising awareness of dementia.But at the same time we must be careful who we train, because there are too many people out in this world who could use it for the wrong reasonsThe positivesHowever there is a great deal of good work being done around the country, much of which is being done independently, by people who really care.We see this in communities like Corbridge on Tyneside which is attempting to be a dementia friendly community, which is a bigger step forward and one which should be applauded. This was set up by a community leader who wanted to help those with dementia, and he had the support of many shop owners etc, in the town.But to do this they needed all of the traders in the town to take part, and that had positiveresults, because they all seemed prepared to take part, and for the right reasons.This proved to me that communities can work wonders, if they are united, and in many cases they can do a lot of this, with or without the support of charities. This is because these people understand the needs of those in their locality better than any charity could ever do.We need this to work and work well, so let us all hope this works and also hope that people with dementia take an active part in training.",

        "content": "When you go through the diagnosis procedure for dementia, it can be the most distressing thing you may ever experience, depending on the consultant.I was diagnosed twice, but the first was the worst thing I could ever imagine, as the consultant did not want to be there at all.I was using a Dictaphone at the time so that I could remember what was being said, but he kept forgetting to arrange scans and tests, and would get, annoyed when I returned because the results were not there.This had been set up by my employers the University, and my wife was only allowed in at certain times as it was classed as confidential, and this made matters much worse for me, as I did not have much support.As I was working at the University at the time, and the doctors got so annoyed that they demanded I had a new consultant, after which things got slightly better.Eventually this lead to my diagnosis of LewyBody Dementia, although we got no support and I was not offered medication.I was told to come back in 9 months, and as my dear wife has said on many occasions, a lady could go away and return with a baby?. \"Not for me\"However this process was also made worse by a clinical psychologist, who said that I was just lazy and did not even try to do the tests properly, and I left at the end of a long 6 hour session in tears.I had gone from being an engineer doing electrical work along with two large budgets, to someone who was counting on my fingers, and to this day my mental arithmetic is rubbish and embarrassing, yet he could not see that I was struggling.I think my wife was close to thumping this man, but she did not.After this I lost my job as an engineer,A few days later my mother died, and it was decided by the family that we should move back to the family home in the North East of England.We brought hospital and doctors letters with us explaining the whole process I had gone through, hoping that would be the end of the diagnosis experience, but we then heard that the original hospital had lost my notes.After waiting 6 months I was told to my horror, that I would have to go through the diagnosis procedure all over again.However the new consultant was a lady, and that changed things completely, as the diagnosis was totally different and dementia friendly experience. A better experience all round if I dare call it that.Sadly this consultant retired to go and climb the Himalayan mountains, so I never saw her again.So this whole process can be distressing for those going through it.Many people still go through life having their diagnosis questioned by other professionals, who may know something about dementia, but do they in all reality knowall there is to know about each type.As well as this we all find that we lose friends, many of whom think that the illness is contagious, or they simply don't want anyone with that illness in their company. Yes I can be unpredictable, simply because I struggle to express myself at times and panicEither the wrong words come out, or I get agitated trying to explain myself on occasion s, but that's this horrible illness.When I am asked to speak at functions, I spend so much time in planning what I am going to say, so that I feel more in controlYet many so called experts in dementia charities, think we can turn up and give a talk on the spur of the moment, so do they really understand this illness themselves.However I enjoy my life and have enjoyed giving presentations around the UK, something which has given me a good reason to fight the illness, and long may it last.Because others need to know what life is like when we have dementia, and if giving these talks helps them to understand dementia, then we must carry on doing it as long as we can.",

To me it's a real honour to be asked to attend this event, and hopefully after Monday other North East Townswill follow.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We need tomake all of the UK, Dementia Friendly, a place where everyone living with anyform of Dementia or Neurological Illness can live the lives they require, andindeed deserve, rather than the type of country, where they are told what theycan and cannot do.In the pastpeople with dementia were kept away from the public, but now we see those inthe early to mid-stages regularly on the streets, and can sometimes be seencampaigning, for better conditions for others less fortunate than us. With theright help they can all go on to achieve better things, as it has been provedthat people can live well with dementia, if they are diagnosed early enough,given the correct medication and support they need.However todo this we need to totally change people\u2019s attitudes towards dementia, and inthe process remove the horrible stigma which still exists with this illnesstoday. A stigma wesaw in the 1960s when Cancer was mentioned in the neighbourhood, and in manycases was thought of as a dirty word, now however, that has gone and we see thestigma in dementia.To do thiswe need to re-educate everyone, and tell them what dementia is, and remove themyths that we see and hear, when we are giving talks etc.We must alsoencourage those with early onset dementia, to go out into the community wherethey will hopefully get support and guidance for the future, to enable them tolive an independent and active life as a real part of the community.We must alsostart to re-educate people about this illness, from raising awareness of oursymptoms and problems, to explaining how others can help usMany youngpeople are starting to recognise that their Grandparents are ill, and they wantto know how they can help, so we should start with these young people and thengo into places like schools, shops, banks, and other public places, wherepeople with dementia would like to go, but in many cases they are frightened.It\u2019s wellknown that social media can play a major part in raising awareness, as manyyoungsters use places like Face Book and Twitter.On thesethere are many sites where dementia is openly discussed and any questions canbe asked.The task ofcreating a dementia friendly community has been a long time in coming, but overthe last two or three years, it has taken a big step forward and people arestarting to listen and take interest, something which we dared not evenconsider before.Howeverdementia friendly communities can only exist where there is a willingness toshare information between the people, the policy makers, media and business. At the heartof all raising awareness campaigning, there must be people with first-handexperience of Dementia whether they are living with it, caring for someone withit, or have done so in the pastAs oneperson put it recently, you cannot tell people what to do or say, unless youhave the illness, because it\u2019s only when you have dementia that you reallyunderstand what it\u2019s like to live with itThese peopleare the pioneers, who can lead the way in helping the whole country feel aspassionate about dementia care as we doneAs a well-known phrase goes, from smallacorns grow big treesWe mustremember that there is more than one type of dementia, and no two people havethe same symptoms and problemsIt upsets some people with dementia, when theyhear someone say, that all people with dementia are the same. In fact there arewell over 120 variations of this illness, so we must make allowances for all.Anotherquite common idea these days is that, people with dementia cannot speak, or doanything for them selvesI have evencome across people who thought the illness was contagious, and others whothought that when you get the illness you become deaf. So where does this all come from is it theold stigma.One day Iheard someone say, that if a person has Alzheimer\u2019s, they are not worth botheringwith, because they cannot take an active part, simply because they hardlyspeak. These peopletend to take more notice that anyone else, so it proves that this idea istotally unfounded and wrong. Theiractions and facial expressions tell you all you need to know. All you have todo is spend time watching what they are doing, and not make rash decisionsabout themTo reallyget dementia friendly communities to work we mustTry tounderstand the illnessHelp andsupport those with the illnessWe may havedementia, but we are still normal peopleWe may actstrangely at times, but that\u2019s because we are out of our comfort zoneA goodfriend of mine has been working with Banks so that we can get more support whenneeded. This means that people with dementia can go into any bank and not bemade look stupidThe reasonbeing that banks could not or did not realise, that people with dementia strugglewith, or cannot use Credit and Bankcards. I think thatthey found this heard to acceptTrevorJarvis from Doncaster, a person with Vascular Dementia, took up the challengeto make banks understand just how hard it is to use these cards in Banks, orwithdraw money from cash machines etc.After threelong years this has now paid off, and we must applaud him for his sheer gustsand determination, to do this on his own and succeed.Through thismy wife and I have been working in some branches of Lloyds bank to make themdementia friendly, and this is paying off.However thisis only one small part of a major problem, which like it or not, is onlyunderstood by those living with the illness. Unless large companies etc., takenotice of what they are being told by people with dementia, they will nevermove on.Now we mustensure that every town, shop, hotel, and public service, are more dementiafriendly, something we hardly see these days, but it\u2019s improving by the day.Churches canalso do there bit, by arranging, services for those with the illness, Serviceswhich are short and to the point, without long sermons, and by using old wellknown hymnsWe shouldnow encourage local businesses to have standard easy to understand signs ontheir premises and have dementia friendly layouts, to cut back on confusion,when trying to find somethingIf we startearly enough we can achieve something that would have been classed asimpossible ten years ago, so it\u2019s up to everyone to go out and changes thingsfor the futureSo let\u2019s allgo out and show the Country what is needed, small changes soon become big changesEducate peopleShow themwhat help we need Help peopleto understand our needs",

Sometimes theygive a series of prompts, In this life, whether at work or anywhere else, we don\u2019t getprompts when we get things wrong, so just how does this work and how do theyget the results right.I do not understand these people, but perhaps they know whatthey are doing, I simply don\u2019t understand it.To me if I don\u2019t know the answer, then it\u2019s simply gone,because trying to force myself the think of an answer just causes unnecessarystress.In normal life we never have the benefit of having theanswers nearby or anyone helping us, because no one has any idea what we arethinking at any one stage, so how canthese tests be worth doing, and how can they prove anything. I find this whole process very hard and distressing, and sometimes feel as if they are making uslook silly. There are many times during the day that I go to dosomething, but then forget what I was going to do, but there are no prompts,and unless I have remembered to write it down somewhere it\u2019s all lost and gone.I know that many other people are struggling to understandthis same topic for the very same reasons",

        "content": "Whilewe were at a meeting we heard someone ask if it was possible to live well withdementia and that made me think, because it came from an old age psychiatrist.I sat and thoughtabout this for quite some time before starting to write, as part of me wascalling this person an idiot, but the other part was asking if he really knewwhat it was like to live with this illnessI guess it all comes down to getting a timely or an earlydiagnosis and then the correct support, help and guidance you need to get onwith a new life.I do feel thatmost of this hinges on being diagnosed at an early stage, and gettingmedication, so that you can achieve a good quality of life from there on,although I do believe that it\u2019s all down to the diagnosis and how it is handledby the consultant. But you really have to try accepting the diagnosis, andtry to be positive, even though, it\u2019s going to be very difficult. Find friends who are supportive, yes we all lose friendsafter the diagnosis, but are they really true friends when they go like this.Find local support groups and dementia charities, whichcan help, and meet new friends who may well do different activities.It also comes down to accepting your limitations and nottrying to do the impossible,Trying to work with your problems and not fighting themall of the time, so you end up feeling sad and depressedAccept the failures and if possible try something differentUnderstanding that life will not all be a bed of roses,yes we have brilliant days, but we also have terrible days when our brainsdon\u2019t seem to work.Enjoy what you can do, and treat each day as a new startand a new challengeWhenI was diagnosed my consultant gave me some advice, which I still try toremember and stick to.My diagnosisFirst diagnosis After the diagnosisof Dementia many like myself, are left feeling sad, and are left with nothingbut negative feelings, as life as they know it is changing fast, and they haveno idea just how they or others will cope with things from then on.After my first diagnosisof early onset Lewy Body Dementia, I was left drained and shocked, as I hadonly ever heard of Senile Dementia, We then had to movehome because I had lost my job etc, through the diagnosis, but by the time Isaw the next consultant we found out that the first hospital had lost all of mynotes. However the first hospital hadnot been helpful according to my wife and gave us no advice or supportHowever my secondconsultant changed all of that within half an hour, as she told me to expectchanges, to accept them and move on, as fighting could have the wrong effect. We had two long sessions with her and in manyways she prepared me for the futureIn her words:- youmay struggle to do something one day , something that you have done for yearsand may not succeed in doing the project in hand. If it fails, leave itand try again another day. If after 4-5goes it still fails, then leave well alone, as there was a danger in gettingquite depressed at not being able to do other things, and therefore I should becareful, and think about it.These words have kept me going, becauseI have lost the ability to do many things including hobbies, but I still have alife to live and will continue to do so while I am able.But to many people who get thediagnosis of dementia, life as we knew it has come to an end, but many areencouraged to get involved with charities such as the Alzheimer\u2019s Society wherethey can get help and support both for themselves and their carers.To have a good quality of life we allneed the support from others But it should also be remembered thateveryone, with dementia is totally different, and they react in different ways,no one size fits all. By that I mean that some people canretain information where others find it difficult.As someone said only the other day, notall forms of dementia follow a pattern as laid down in the text books, and manywith the same form of dementia are vastly different, so please make allowancesfor us and give us the time to assess what is happening and answer in our ownwordsNo two people with any form of dementiaare the same; we are all individuals with individual problems and symptoms Many like myself try to make notes aswords don\u2019t always come easily, and sometimes the wrong words come out leadingto people thinking we are rude or aggressive, something that annoys me as itproves these people really don\u2019t have a clue about dementia. Don\u2019t make the mistake that many peopledo, and that is ask a question and then try to answer it for us.It is my view that those with thisillness, should push themselves to the limit if they can in the early stages,as it would be very easy to give into this illness.I must add that I am in no wayrestricted in what I do, as I still enjoy photography, walking and painting ongood days when I can get things in the right prospective although these daysare running out slowly, but there are limits to how far I will go before I stopmyself, before I get frustrated at my inability to do things that I have donefor many years.As I have said before I use assistivetechnology in most of my hobbies, as it helps me carry on doing things likephotography, and although it gets tiring carrying all the stuff around attimes, it stops me thinking of what is around the corner. There are many gadgets to help in thishobby such as tripods and remote control gadgets for the days when my handshakes, but this does not stop me enjoying lifeI agree that not everyone shares myviews and I would not expect them to, as we are all different, and havedifferent views, but at least these are mine and they have kept me going.My quality of life now also takes in a lot of assertive technology, fromhearing aids which have enhanced my hearing, to the voice activated software onmy computer, all of which has enhanced my life, so I am not giving up.As far as I am concerned I have a goodquality of life and would like to hear from other people with dementia and heartheir own views on this topic. I also know that I am extremely luckyto still have the freedom to do what I want at present, but others are not aslucky as me.This consultant also told me to write my life story,something that I did not understand at first, but when she explained it, it allmade sense.So much of my early life was unknown by my wife let alonemy children or grandchildren, so it\u2019s there for them to read later on, it alsohelps carers understand more about us if we ever need to go into a care home.I was also told to keep a diary, because I was strugglingwith very graphic nightmares and dreams at night. The idea was that as thesewere still fresh in my mind the next day, I was to try writing them down sothat it may help the psychologist when I met her later.This all helps and it\u2019s up to the person with theillness, to decide whether they are going to fight the illness and try to enjoythemselves while they can or just sit back and give in to the inevitable Like many who havethis illness, I have lost control of my writing, spelling, and grammar,something I was always proud of when I was working. I used to be in charge oftwo large Budgets at work, now my arithmetic is none existent on some days. I was also responsible for all of the electrical work atwork, and rewired the College Chapel, but now I cannot fit a 13 amp plug top That is all in the past, most of which I simply cannoteven remember, but I still keep going, because I simply don\u2019t wish to stop andgive in. As long as people understand these problems, then we haveno worries, if they cannot accept them then they really don\u2019t understand thisillness at all I guess that like many people who have dementia, we havealways remained active and I suppose we always will do, as we are fightersSo to answer the Question from the meeting So isit possible to live well with dementia? Ithink if you are positive, it is possible, but you have to accept the diagnosisand the changes, after that anything is possibleBut remember that in the UK alone, there are many dementia organisations, like the Alzheimer's Society, Lewy Body Dementia Society, Innovations in Dementia etc, all there to help you, so please us them and get the support you need.There are many more groups, but I simply do not remember them, however, one dayI will makea list of them all to keep on the blog ",

WE WERE ALWAYS OUTSIDE PLAYING!!We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came on.No one was able to reach us all day.

We can string sentences together and spell and have proper conversations because of a good, solid three R's education. Our parents would tell us to ask a stranger to help us cross the road. The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard of.They actually sided with the law!Our parents didn't invent stupid names for their kids like 'Kiora' and 'Blade' and 'Ridge' and 'Vanilla'We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned HOW TO DEAL WITH IT ALL !And YOU are one of them!

The NHS rationingbody, Nice, fears the Department of Health proposals could see younger peopledeemed a higher priority for drug treatments because they have more years aheadof them \u2013 potentially contributing more to the economy \u2013 than the elderly. Controversial: TheNHS rationing body, Nice, fears the Department of Health proposals could seeyounger people deemed a higher priority for drug treatments (file picture)Doctors, MPs andcampaigners last night condemned the plans as \u2018barking mad\u2019.The move will alsofuel fears that the elderly are receiving a worse deal from the health servicethan the young. Cancer charitieshave already warned that \u2018cruel restrictions\u2019 mean older patients have beendenied medical treatment, regardless of a proper assessment of their fitnesslevels and how likely they could benefit from treatment.Sir Andrew Dillon,the head of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, said he wasconcerned about the new rules and feared they would lead to older patientsbeing penalised in a \u2018hard-nosed\u2019 and \u2018crude\u2019 economic approach.The reforms, whichare being consulted on, would see new drugs assessed for the first time basedpartly on whether they would benefit society as a whole \u2013 not just the patient.For example, adrug that helped people to live longer in an expensive care home, or onwelfare, might have a \u2018negative\u2019 social value not outweighed by the benefit tothe individual, because such patients take more from society than they can putback.Sir Andrew said:\u2018There are lots of people who adopt the fair-innings approach: \u201cYou\u2019ve had 70years of life \u2013 you\u2019ve got to accept society is going to bias its investmentsin younger people.\u201d There are people who subscribe to that, but it\u2019s notsomething we feel comfortable with.\u2019He said an initialassessment by Nice suggested that accounting for \u2018wider societal benefit\u2019 wouldinevitably tilt funding away from the old because younger patients had more togain from treatment and more to give back. He added: \u2018We\u2019rereally concerned that we don\u2019t send out a message that we value life less whenyou\u2019re 70 than when you\u2019re 20.\u2019 Ciar\u00e1n Devane,chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: \u2018The UK has some of theworst cancer survival rates in Europe and they are especially bad for olderpeople. Macmillan strongly recommends against any action which could make thisworse. The Nice board is right to reject the Department of Health\u2019s proposal.\u2019Penny Mordaunt,Tory MP and co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on ageing andolder people, said any new rules on societal benefit would be \u2018absolutelywrong\u2019.\u2018Age shouldn\u2019t come into it,\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s about you as an individual andwhat drugs work for you. You cannot decide from someone\u2019s age, their ability tobenefit from treatment. It\u2019s about them as an individual.\u2019QUALITYOF LIFE VERSUS THE COSTUnder the currentsystem, Nice determines the cost of a new treatment by working out how much itimproves and extends a person\u2019s life compared to existing treatments.It uses a formulaknown as \u2018quality adjusted life year\u2019 or QALY. One QALY equalsone year of perfect health, or two years of 50 per cent perfect health or fouryears of 25 per cent perfect health.Generally, if thecost per QALY is below \u00a320,000, the treatment is deemed cost effective andapproved.If it fallsbetween \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000, Nice needs \u2018persuasion\u2019 to give it the go-ahead. If the cost ismore than \u00a330,000, the drug is not normally approved.Andrew Percy, aTory member of the health select committee, said: \u2018I am sure that [restrictingdrugs to older people] is not the intention of the rules. If it is, it would bebarking mad. Clearly people who have paid into the NHS should receive thesupport they need through their entire lives, including in retirement.\u2019RosAltmann, a former adviser to the Treasury on older people, said it was \u2018veryfrightening\u2019 that such a model was being considered.\u2018It is quiteOrwellian that it is being said that if you\u2019re no longer fit for work, youaren\u2019t owed anything by society,\u2019 she said. \u2018It is wrong tosay older people do not contribute to society. They do so much voluntarily fortheir local community and for their families through free childcare forgrandchildren. All this saves us billions of pounds.\u2019 Leading prostatecancer specialist Professor Jonathan Waxman said Nice was an organisation \u2018notfit for purpose\u2019. He added: \u2018Nice has been the main brake on the availability of cancer drugsduring the last decade and caused considerable distress and deaths based on anopaque and unscientific evaluation system.\u2018We needtransparency about how these decisions are made.\u2019A spokesman forthe Department of Health said changing the rules would ensure good value formoney \u2013 without penalising the elderly.He added: \u2018That\u2019swhy we have asked Nice to look at the way drugs are assessed so that patientscan get the treatments they need at the best value for the NHS.\u2018The allegation that older people will miss out is absolutely not true.\u2019Afterreading this I am left feeling sick that any Government could even considerthis, especially when they claim to be squeaky clean and are still fiddlingexpensesThereare many ways of raising money, including making sure that everyone in this countrypays their tax\u2019s, or should we say pays them to the treasury in the UK, something the Tories have refused to do, yetit would raise billions of pounds. Likeso many other people I will never ever vote for this shower ever again, when Ilook at them carefully they are no better that the mafia.Last night they showed a selection of medication on Television including Exelon, something I take for dementia with lewy bodies",

        "content": "There has been a lot of discussion over the Internet about the role of Dementia charities, and who is best to cover our problems. Some of this is starting to get very political and in some cases annoyingI guess before going any further I do think that there is a lot of politics involved in this subject, and if you are not careful you could be dragged into something you don't want.I have worked with the Alzheimer's Society and the Lewy Body Society, where I am honoured to be an Ambassador.The Alzheimer's Society in the UK like other charities claim to cover all forms of the illness, but its up to the person with the illness as to what they want and no one else can tell them what to do.But I personally feel that if you want to get all of the information concerning \"your own form\" of the illness, you should then seek out a charity which covers, and which is totally dedicated to that form of the illness.I say this because they are usually backed up by professionals in that one field, people who are doing research into that form of the illness and nothing else.In the case of the Lewy Body Society the information is backed up and supported by professors in Lewy Body Dementia, people who are the leads in this research, so nothing can ever beat this. These people are better positioned to give the correct advise and the whole picture  when I look at literature about Lewy Body Dementia, each charity tells us different things, and not all are accurate, which is very sad, because, when I was diagnosed I looked everywhere for advice and was staggered at the different advice given out, much of which had not at that time been updated.However the advice is only about certain types of illness, and not everyone is covered.There is also a danger that if you enter a chat room on the wrong website, you may be given the wrong advice, by someone with a different form of dementia, or from a carer who has looked after a person with a different form of dementia I remember early on being told to get a second opinion, by a carer who knew nothing about my form of the illness, something that was distressing and wrong.But please remember that each country has different ideas and treatments.The reason for this is that dementia is a vast and complicated illness. There may be around 10 types of dementia, but there are over 120 variations, so no matter what we do, we will never find information which covers all forms of the illness, simply because no two people have the same symptoms and problems.Some forms of the illness also get combined which makes life even more complicatedThis is why I started this blog in the first place, because I was told to write down my problems, so that it could be followed, and better understood.Many people have contacted me over the last few years, saying that I have mentioned problems that they or someone close had struggled with, and yet they were never told about it by the professionals or charities.The answer I guess is simple, everyone takes the shortest possible route, and cover only certain subjects.One problem that many charities will not cover is the graphic nightmares we struggle with in certain forms of dementia, and the answer is that they don't wish to frighten anyone.But if you are not told about it, it can have the wrong effect on the person.I had discussed my problems with my consultant in the first place, so I knew all about these graphic nightmares, but many people are not told about them, and simply think that they are going mad.My advice would be to find a charity which covers your own form of the illness first, in your own country if possible, and get the advice you need and then if you want to look at other charities.I am not being political, or telling people what they should or should not do, but simply telling people what I would do if I was diagnosed today.Each charity has its own ideas and these are my own ideas from my experience only, and I still work with any dementia charity which asks me, because its very important that we raise the profile of dementia.I must also point out that when I was diagnosed the Alzheimer's Society were very helpful to us, and got me going in a role of travelling around the UK talking about living well with dementia, and I will be eternally grateful, to them for everything they have done and will continue to support them while I can. Many small local branches will ensure that all local information is kept up to date. So never forget your local branches whoever they are run by Sometimes smaller charities are better places if you want someone to help, with local information and support, and sometime's they are more friendly as they are more hands on, but its all down to the person and what they want from the charity.Many years ago the Alzheimer's Society used to have local branches in most towns, now they have nearly all gone, and many are simply locality offices for the staff.I found local office much better for support and help, but as we know life changes as do large charities",

        "content": "Like everyone else with any form of dementia we tend to struggle on learning to live with this illness, but never really take on board the extra problems that come with the illness.Memory causes so many problems in this illness, yet when we look at the other problems life becomes a bit of a nightmare.Co morbidity in dementia is not something to be taken lightly or ignored, let until, I was at a meeting the other day, I had not really put everything together. I was looking at certain problems on their own, and only when I had to. But like many other people my eyes are playing up and changing rapidly sometimes, so its very difficult to read, or see words or item for what they are.I guess its a form of word blindness, I see the word but these days don't always understand what it means, or is trying to say, and that is very hard to cope with, and can be distressing.I know that it does not happen all of the time, but when it does it causes a lot of upset, trying to think how to spell a word, or say it, even breaking it down does not help, and trying spell checker does not work, if you cannot get the gist of how a word should be said let alone written.This also causes problems with the blog, because I get comments about spelling, yet some days everything looks good, its only later when you go back and see words which don't make senseI sometimes look at words and think they are foreign, yet they are English, its just my brain playing up and not registering what it says or meansIf I am copying numbers these days I have to say them out loud, otherwise I say them back to front and that is really embarrassing.I have had this for years, yet when I had eye tests I have been told that my eyes are fine, nothing wrong? now it seems that some people have noticed that we really do have problems.For some time I have had problems crossing the roads when busy, as I simply cannot judge just how far the next vehicle is away from me.This can be serious, and on two occasions, I have been too close to buses coming along the road, and have been saved only by the fact that there was a traffic island which slowed the vehicles down.This all came to a head in London this week, when I was shouted at by my wife, and ended up being guided across the road, something I really did not want. But when you are nearly run over by two buses, you start to think about just what is going on in your head.I had this early on in my illness and it came as quite a shock, but it seemed to clear, so I never thought about it again. Or was it that I crossed these same roads when my brain was having a good day, I simply don't know.But spacial problems is one of the major things we have to cope with on a daily basis these days and that's not where it ends.I have walked into many door frames because I missed the door opening completely, and when it comes to escalators or elevators and revolving doors, I simply freeze at times, because judging the right time to step forward is a nightmare. This also causes upset, because those following simply think you are messing around, and are holding them up, they simply do not understand your predicament and possible fear at the time. Staying upright in shopping malls is another thing which causes problems, as other people these days live in their own world, and try to walk through you or across your path leaving you feeling unstableMany find their hearing goes, or can go between very acute and very bad depending on the situation.I have hearing aids to help in noisy situations, but also need to use them turned up when listening to the television or radio.But on the bad days, a noisy voice or even a bag of crisps being opened, can make life unbearable.I know that I am certainly not alone with this, and on these days I long for a quiet sunny island with no radio or television or indeed people to upset things. Many think that this is a part of depression, but its a major part of some dementia's and its difficult to get used to.We can then look at other co morbidity's life, depression, diabetes, heart, stroke and many other problems and the list goes on all making life with dementia a mine field to live with. I guess as someone said the other day, when dementia strikes, other bits start to follow in rapid succession..This subject is something that is fascinating to learn about, because you really learn so much about your life, things that you either ignored at your peril or simply took for granted I suppose that is all bad enough, but when you get a chest infection etc these things get even worse, and no matter what you do life is miserable.",

Is this the work of the Mayor Boris or Network rail engineers who just do what they think is best without consulting the public.Before this section was built I could cope without too much trouble, but now you seem to walk miles out of your way in atrocious conditions without support of handrails or guards rails to keep you upright.This really s a nightmare for people with any form of spacial problems, and possibly a waste of public money, and while I know that things must improve, we can do without this,Please consult others before building places like this in the future.",

What happened to honest politicians, do they no longer exist.As a person who knows what it is like to struggle during and after a flood I find these politician's remarks to be totally unacceptable, wrong and unhelpful.These people should hang their heads in shame, because they have lost control of the situation, now and Mr Cameron has been panicked into doing something 6-8 weeks too lateWe are also seeing these flooded areas being flooded by the media showing pictures of empty houses and people in distress, I suppose cheap news all round at the expense of those in distress.Some of these properties are now at risk of burglaries simply because of media stupidity, so why does the government not step in and clear these idiots away from these floods.I guess the answer to that yet again is the dear Mr Cameron is dead against media control, so these people can get away with anything they wish, whether we like it or not.This country is heading into building a new high speed railway line to Birmingham and Manchester, a line which will save at most 20 mins per journey? so is that worth it when the rest of the county is in a total mess. This money should be used to improve the country as a whole, especially when we consider it could be built by outsiders.Lets us stop blaming everyone else, and get control over this situation, before too many people get hurt by this blame culture.This could all be to do with global warming, it certainly seems like it, but its time the government got to grips with this.

I had double vision problems many years ago and it was corrected, but that was before the Lewy Body dementia started. I also have word blindness, so I don't always understand words these days, and on other days find it very difficult to spell or think how to spell words, which is very distressingUnderstanding numbers now is also distressing especially when it gets to larger numbers, I get very confused.I confess that I am starting to wonder if the dementia is behind this, especially as it\u2019s intermittent and not there all of the time. I try to keep myself active but when this starts it causes upset as I cannot do the things I want to do, or cannot see properly to concentrate.There is now a lot of research going on into this subject, and I am waiting to see what happens, as many people with dementia, that I know seem to be having problems with eyesight too.I am convinced that although the double vision was found and corrected, it has left me wondering about the other problems that I have on a daily basis. I am convinced now that the most of these problems can only be caused by the Lewy Body Dementia, or dementia in general, but I confess that I got so stressed out with the people doing the tests that I lost interest. I do think that this was because they seemed to have little or no idea about the project they were working on.It is so sad because the idea behind this was good, and could possibly have succeeded if those doing the tests had been more helpful and understanding.Even the Eye hospital could not say whether dementia can cause problems with the eyes.Perhaps sometime in the future someone will complete these tests and come out with a plausible answer.I know that my eyes change quite a lot and this causes a lot of stress, even with the new spectacles, but I guess that's all down to trying to live with a brain diseaseBut it must be remembered that there are many variations of dementia, and not everyone may struggle with eyesight problems. We will just have to wait to see what happensAs with all illnesses, we need to know about problems like this, not because I am angry at having the illness, but because the more information we have the easier life will be, to cope with in the long run",

        "content": "After a very good sleep last night, in fact my first in over a month, I got up and decided to get my head into gear, and for once a topic came to my head, so here we goPhotography is a wonderful hobby for everyone these days, but its also a lovely hobby for people with memory problems and dementia.I have many friends living with various forms of dementia, and quite a lot of them love this hobby because photography allows them to express themselves in a different way, and its very interesting looking at some of their photos as they all seem to see things in different ways.A few years ago, I was close to giving up the hobby because, I was seeing too many professional photographs, and I knew that they left me for dead.But a good friend in Scotland James McKillop, told me to carry on and ignore the rest.He went on to tell me, that we see things differently to other people, and therefore our pictures are sometimes unique.He then went on to have his own exhibition in Scotland, and I was very proud for him, perhaps not as proud as he was himself, but all the same very proud that someone with dementia could have his own photographic exhibition.What is more his photographs were wonderful.Yet when you look around there are few if any courses available for those who have this illness, simply I think because many people assume wrongly, that when you get this illness you are incapable of doing anything.I know that there are days when I cannot work the settings out, so a short course would be extremely difficult to cope with, but it would be nice if someone out in the big wide world could put together a resource pack which would help those wanting to do this as a hobby.I have noticed that some magazines are doing things like small skills cards with some settings on, and that is a good step forward as they act as a prompt when you badly need it. Perhaps someone selling these in complete sets would make like much easierThere are many short courses out in the world for carers, but when you have this illness you are largely ignored, or the course is written for people with perfect memories, unlike us where we have short term memory lose.I can get used to something, and then the next moment its gone in to the distant, and that can be upsetting, but we just have to keep pushing forward and hope.I do feel that sometimes a short graphic course or a small pocket sized hand book would be ideal, as it could be taken with you and used when the wheels come off.I know that some people out there with this illness, think some of this is patronizing, but we must remember that all dementia's are vastly different and no two people are the same with the same problems.People sometimes ask why we don't stick to automatic settings on cameras. The short answer is that we, like everyone else, all try to push the boundaries even with this illness, so manual settings becomes fun to attempt, and in this time of digital cameras, you can delete your mistakes of which there are many, each time you go out.We hardly get a rapid response if we see something flying towards us unless its a good day, but if it works we really do get a eureka moment, and you look at this with total pride and astonishment, but along with that you get many failures.I have had this watching swans taking off and landing, and you feel full of pride, even if you got the settings wrong at the timeBut its all good fun, and while you can do it, you are keeping your brain active.I have found that I get very tired some days when I go for a walk round the riverside park, but I have noticed that if I find a nice wall or something to sit on, and just wait things like swans and ducks come and sit down by me.This only happens on the quiet days, but the thrill and enjoyment is amazing, because you are allowed into the animals private world, and can take photos without worrying them or being worried about swans getting too close. I admit that I get worried at times when these large birds get close, but that's all down to my spacial awareness, but between us we are getting better, and in some way I feel accepted by them on these quiet days. Its amazing if a swan gets close enough and allows you to touch it, it gives a true feeling of peace and nothing can ever replace that. I have seen king fishers down there but I am not fast enough to photograph them, nor do I have a large enough lens, but its still s thrill to try.So please encourage people with dementia to do this as a hobby, or perhaps get a local photographer involved to see if they can inspire new people to get involved with this wonderful hobby.

        "content": "Looking at the news these days I feel very upset for those who are under threat of flooding in the South West of England.Having suffered from flooding two years ago, we suffered a lot of upset and distress, and we had to move out of our home for 6 months while it was rebuilt. A lot of this has disappeared from memory now, which is one of the positive things, if I can say that for memory problems.We had around 30 inches of water in the house for around 6 hours, after which we were left with a sea of mud and sludge.When I look at television and see the homes in the South West, I do wonder how they cope with this as its gone on since Christmas, and there seems to be no end in sight.How many people in this are have problems like dementia, and are struggling to cope. It must be bad enough when you are fit and active, but if you have an illness it will be devastating.I really do wonder what is going on. I do understand that a lot of this could be to do with global warming, and some of these areas are places reclaimed from the sea over the centuries, so is the sea claiming it all back again, if so lots of places around the UK will soon be starting to disappear.Its a little bit frightening to me, but I suppose I am well away from the sea.I gather some of this could be stopped by having large holding areas in the hills, but will the government do this, or will they simply sit back and ignore this problem.They seem hell bent on spending billions of pounds on a train line From London to Birmingham and Manchester, something which makes little or no sense when its going to save around 20 minuets on a train journey to London.They already have a brand new track linking these areas, so surely putting faster trains on this track would be more economical, that would leave more money for projects which were needed like flood defences, around the UK in generalI know that the country is in a mess, but wasting money on this HS2 is unneeded and wrong when other things are needed, and are yet ignored by a bunch of politicians who don't live in the real world.I do think we need a government run by normal people and not a bunch of millionaire's many of whom went to Eton, and think they know everything.Its fairly obvious that these people have no idea what its like to struggle, even though they claim otherwise.",

        "content": "Its been a very long haul with constant chest problems since early December, and I am no where near to getting clear of them yet.I am now back on another long dose of antibiotics, in the hope that this will clear the problem up once and for all, but its left me feeling very tired and low, because of the trouble breathing and the constant coughing up of mucus by the bucket load.When I wake up each morning, I feel as if I have a bag of cement on my chest, and it takes time to clear this so that I can breath again.Over the last few weeks I confess that I lost total interest in all of my hobbies including my blog, and this in turn has hit my ability to think and work things out.I have been warned that I will be a hospital inpatient if this does not clear, and I confess to being terrified of that now, I simply don't want to go there. I now have a fear of hospitals and simply don't wish to go there, because those places and dementia don't go together anymore.It could well be as one doctor put it, that my lungs are in a mess from years of industrial poisons, from asbestos dust, wood dust, along with other stuff which was inhaled over the years without thinking about it.Health and safety is far better now that it was in the 1960-70s, and when you see that hazards you worked with in that time its quiet frightening, but that's all water under the bridge so to speak, and what's gone can not be put right now. Some hazards were well known about others were not until it was too late for many.However I did get asthma from wood dust, and I understand that this could also be my asthma going into the next stage, and that is something which has not been fully explained yet, but no doubt that will come in the next few weeks if this does not clear as expected.Many years ago I was a smoker, until I was given an unholy talking to by our then Welsh GP, who said that I would not live to see our children grow up if I did not stop. This was because I had bronchitis for the second time in 6 months.At that time I was also working on large oil fired boilers, doing all of the servicing and cleaning. That night I walked out of the flat and threw the cigarettes in the boiler and never touched one ever again.These days doctors do not speak to you like that any more, which is a great pity, because the world would be healthier place if they did, we would not have the vast numbers of obese people, nor would people be still smoking wrecking their lives along with other peoples lives with passive smoking.But that's life as we know it and these days no one likes being told what to do even though its common sense. I suppose that main problem these days especially in the UK, is that each time you go to the doctors you tend to see a different doctor, who has different ideas of what is wrong and what is needed, there is no continuity anymore. If you ask to see a certain doctor, you are frowned on, yet as one said its the only way to keep continuity these days.Like all illnesses these days, I do feel that if a doctor does not understand what is going on, they should refer you to someone who does understand, so that support and help can be given rather than dragging it out so that things get worse.Whenyou have dementia and get other problems like this, life becomes very hard, sometimes distressing and difficult to get yourself inspired let alone do anything to help yourself.You cannot think straight, and sometimes becomes very distressed, and then take it out on loved ones, which hurts even more.I no longer have or feel religious, I feel as if its all sliding away, as everything which I held so dear, means little or nothing these days.Carers struggle at times seeing this and I gather my wife has been upset in church and places like that, simply because, she can see the damage being done to me, while the doctors simply sit back and don't want to do anything.We have now at least found a doctor who is genuine and helpful, but it remains to be seen, how long this will last as I am not positive any more, I confess to be losing the will to fight, and that is something I don't like admitting to, but I know that its true now.I can only hope that this year improves after this start.

In her words:- you may struggle to dosomething one day that you have done for years and may not succeed in doing theproject in hand. If it fails, leave it and try again another day. She said that there was a danger ingetting quite depressed at not being able to do things, and therefore I shouldbe careful, and think about it.These words have kept me going, becauseI have lost the ability to do many things including hobbies, but I still have alife to live and will continue to do so while I am able.But to many people who get thediagnosis of dementia, life as we knew it has come to an end, but many areencouraged to get involved with charities such as the Alzheimer\u2019s Society wherethey can get help and support both for themselves and their carers.To have a good quality of life we allneed the support from others and not, be invited as the token person withdementia as I have heard so many times before This path can take many routes, butlike myself, many get involved In meetings which are helpful to us, and allowus to help others by changing the way those with dementia are treated withinsociety.But this is littered with problems, assome people that I have come across, resent us giving our ideas as they thinkwe don\u2019t know what we are talking about, or they speak in medical jargon etc.,which is very hard to workout what they are getting at and remember. This is in my view sending out thewrong message and must be changed once and for all.But it should also be remembered that everyone, with dementia is totallydifferent, and they react in different ways, no one size fits all. By that I mean that some people canretain information where others find it difficult. Many like myself try to makenotes as words don\u2019t always come easily, and sometimes the wrong words come outleading to people thinking we are rude or aggressive, something that annoys meas it proves these people really don\u2019t have a clue about dementia. As someone said only the other day, notall forms of dementia follow a pattern as laid down in the text books, and manywith the same form of dementia are vastly different, so please make allowancesfor us and give us the time to assess what is happening and answer in our ownwords. Don\u2019t make the mistake that many peopledo, and that is ask a question and then try to answer it for us.It is my view that those with this illness should push themselves to the limitif they can in the early stages, as it would be very easy to give into thisillness.I must add that I am in no wayrestricted in what I do, as I still enjoy photography, walking and painting ongood days when I can get things in the right prospective although these daysare running out slowly, but there are limits to how far I will go before I stopmyself, before I get frustrated at my inability to do things that I have donefor many years.As I have said before I use assistivetechnology in most of my hobbies, as it helps me carry on doing things likephotography, and although it gets tiring carrying all the stuff around attimes, it stops me thinking of what is around the corner. There are manygadgets to help in this hobby such as tripods and remote control gadgets forthe days when my hand shakes, but this does not stop me enjoying lifeI agree that not everyone shares myviews and I would not expect them to, as we are all different, and havedifferent views, but at least these are mine and they have kept me going.My quality of life now also takes in a lot of assertive technology, fromhearing aids which have enhanced my hearing, to the buddy tracking device andvoice activated software on my computer, all of which has enhanced my life, soI am not giving up.As far as I am concerned I have a goodquality of life and would like to hear from other people with dementia and heartheir own views on this topic. I also know that I am extremely luckyto still have the freedom to do what I want at present, but others are not solucky as me.",

We went out for a meal yesterday and the two of us were sat on a different table to to everyone else, and had a lovely chat, and we both left feeling happy being together. I miss the grandchildren as we don't see them very often, but when we do see each other we try to enjoy life, something which is not always possible with my dementia and the Grand daughters Asperger's, but I do feel that we may be getting somewhere. Yesterday was a bad day as my tablet computer failed and I had to restore it to get in the internet, but after a few hours It was back to normal again and I was happy, I feel so lost without a computer and internet these days.

This is my third set of antibiotics and steroids this time round, the fourth in six weeks, so I just want this over with now.  I was told that if this does not clear, this time round I would be admitted into hospital, but I know that I am not even considering that option, after the problems I had when I had pneumonia.After that I ended up with a fear of hospitals, because the place was absolutely grim, and the toilets and bathrooms were filthy, so I have no intention of going into another one. As well as that, with my memory problems I get confused in those places, and they will not want me there with my graphic nightmaresI just want to get back to giving presentations about living with dementia, not feeling like a caged tiger, I guess I am just a very bad patient",

        "content": "I have loved music from an early age, and still love it today, although my abilities to sing and tastes of music have changed considerably.I also spent around 10 years in a our Parish church choir as a boy along with my Brother John, and went with them to sing in Durham Cathedral with the Cathedral choir, something that wasa thrill at the time. It washard work but I look back with pride, as I had learnt so much.In my youngerdays I loved some popular music and some classical music, something that was classed as odd for my age. My father thought, I was odd listening to classical music at first and then he got used to it and loved it.This was the era of the Beetles and many large groups, some of which are still going today.I never got into things like Frank Sinatra and rock music, as I could never stand it, but now my tastes have changedI still like classical music, and pop music, but now for some reason I now like listening to Frank Sinatra,Eric Clapton along with Freddie mercury and queen, something as I said I would never have listened to in the past.Is my brain telling me something, I simply don't know, but I have been told by other people with this illness that they have experienced the same problems.However today there are many places running events called, Singing forthe Brain, but I could never go to these because my singing days are over, or as my dear wife has told me in the past, they are well over.I struggle toget my voice going, and sing so low it sounds like its coming from my feet, totally flat.I do however listen to music on my music player, during the bad nights when I have the nightmares and graphic dreams. I have used this music player when I cannot sleep some nights, only to be woken up by my dear wife, telling me to shut up ,because I have been singing as I was drifting off. The usual culprit with this is Glen Cambell and Rhinestone Cowboy, why I simply don't know. I did have a good laugh at this, and now I don't play either Glen Campbell or Jim Reeves when I cannot sleep.The Grandchildren thought it was hilarious, hearing about me singing in my sleep, but to me it could have been a lot worse.This music player is a good thing, but that had back fired on a few occasions, when I learnt that some music I love listening to during the day, has the wrong effects during the night, and can actually trigger bad dreams. This I think is caused by the rhythm and some instruments like String and Violin's. Gast violin's trigger very active and sometimes violent dreams  some of which can be very graphic and violent, or at least the are to me. Only once has my wife come to get hit during the night, and that was when she tried to wake me up, she actually became part of the bad dream and woke the next morning with a lovely black eye. I was very upset and did not understand what had happened, until I sat down and thought about the dream, which was violent. After this I warned carers etc, when I was doing talks about dementia, never to touch someone having on of these horrors of the night as we call them. Keep well back and speak to us. If you get too close you will become part of the event.I do think there is a lot to be said where dementia and singing events are said, because music seems to unlock or memories, and in many cases has actually got people moving singing and taking part, even though they may have been silent for a very long time.Music is generally very calming and relaxing, and to me its a wonderful tool to use, in all illnesses, so we must encourage more events around the country, in the hope that more people get involved.The only time I can go toreligious services these days, is when we are away and attend a Cathedral service where people are restrained, simply because I struggle when people start swaying to the music and singing with their arms in the air, because it makes me feel unstable.",

        "content": "When I look back at mychildhood memories, I stop and then look at today's youngsters, who are alwaysbored out if their minds.When I was young we had aradio, and later on a small television, but we were never allowed to switchthese on. That was a no go area, adults only and anyone else touching these would bein big trouble from our parents.We had moved from a smallcoal mining village to a new council estate in the next town, and that was abit of a culture shock, because it was all people we had never seen before,unlike the village, where most people knew who you were.We had played on the fellsaround the village, and by all accounts, it appears that no one ever knew wherewe were most of the time, but we always arrived back at meal time, even thoughwe did not have little luxuries like wrist watches in those days, and no churchclocks chiming. This area looking back now was in fact a little dangerous asthere were a very large bog in the middle of one section, and many thingsdisappeared never to be seen ever again. After the 2nd world war thearmy used part of the fells for training on Sunday mornings, and we used to goover to watch these tanks and personnel carriers manoeuvring around the fells.It was recorded one day that a brand new tank got too close to the bog anddisappeared, leaving the personnel to clamber along the gun barrel to safety.When we moved to the newestate we had to start from scratch meeting new friends and finding your wayaround, something which was slightly alien to the small village. Here we spent most of ourlives outside playing even in the dark, sometimes much to the annoyance of ourneighbour's, but we never did anything to hurt anyone or anything, that was ano go area.Yes we would play footballand cricket in the back street, because there were no lights around therecreation field, which made it difficult to see the ball in the dark. These days the same field has lighting and swings a complete contrast.So we resorted to using someone\u2019sback gate or a dustbin as a wicket. I know it was noisy at times but we neverdid anything to cause damage, as we were all terrified of getting into troublefrom the neighbours and then our fathers, which had a hidden terror to most of us.Occasionally someone would come out to complain about the noise, but it did notlast, we simply moved away to another area, and then went back later.There were no computers as wesee these days, but we made our own fun up, sometimes as we were going, therewas no such thing as boredom. I can even remember going bybus to the swimming baths in the next town, which was a little hard at timesespecially during the autumn months as it was outside, uncovered and unheated,but good fun, once you got used to the very cold water. We were not allowed to travelfurther to the bigger swimming baths until we were much older, and then thatwas a luxury as they were indoor and heated.We also spent many happyhours getting train numbers outside our front garden, and we would sit for hourswatching for the big express steam trains thundering by on the London toEdinburgh Lines, and also the very large Iron Ore trains travelling up anotherline from Tyne Dock to Consett Iron works and back again.I don't think we did anythingwhich could be looked at as misspent time, because to ustime was valuable,but we were happy and usually very tired at the end of the day.When we went to junior schoolwe went there and back on a bus, but later on when we went to the Upper schoolor borstal as we all laughingly called it, we would walk there and back adistance of 3-4 miles each way, even in the bad weather. Unless it was pouringdown then we would get a bus, rather than sitting in a classroom all dayfeeling wet and cold. It was not a borstal but a secondary modern school, butwe all loved calling it a borstal, because of the way some of the teacherswould react to us.Today no one seems to walk toschool; their parents take them by car, so they don't get the needed exerciseor the fun. We all enjoyed the walk, as it was good fun walking there and back,and we all enjoyed each other\u2019s company.During this time many of uswere in the Cubs and later the Boy Scouts, so life was very busy, and therenever seemed time to spare. A few of us were also in the local Church Choir,and that took up two nights a week for choir practiceWe spent many happy holidays camping with the scouts, travelling to faraway places, and later on in the winter months we had the Scout Gang Shows. These were brilliant to do as we would get dressed up in weird costumes, and do sketches of parents events, comedy and dance and singing routines,along withone or two stranger things like doing the Swan Lake Ballet in ballerinas outfits, but withhiking boots on our feet instead of the correct footwear, simply because we could not wear the shoes.It was a brilliant way to let your hair down and have funBut I look back on most ofthis with pride, although I did have problems, but I suppose most people hadthem one way or another, and if you were extremely lucky as some were, these soon disappearedfrom your memory. One or two were stuck with lifelong memories that wouldperhaps never go awayLike many people at that timewe never got into trouble with the police or anyone else, simply because wewere terrified of fathers reactions afterwards, that was simply something younever went into because of the fear of our fathers. That was a brilliantdeterrent, although my father was not amused when I spoke about years later,because he said it made him feel terrifying, although he did admit to beingfrightened of his own father. But it did no harm because ifyou respected others and the police, you were looked on as a little angelsomething I know that I was not, but I had a great deal of respect.Sometimes we would go to oneof the local the cinemas, something of a treat. I can remember going to seeone film about a Robot called Robby. Beforethe film was shown there was a lorry going round the shopping area carryingthis Robot on the back. Strangely enough the otherday while searching the Internet, I actually found a clip of Robby the Robot,and it all came back so fresh that I could have seen the film yesterday.Looking back these cinemaswere very dark and dirty, and always had mice etc. running round the floor, sowe sat with our feet firmly away from the floor as we did not want anythingwalking around our ankles.Yes it was active and happy,there were weird people around even in those days, but they were not as obviousas they are perhaps today, perhaps in those days they feared the law orreprisals from parents. It\u2019s so sad that today we get these people preying onchildren, but perhaps they are getting more publicity these days than they evergot before. But these days children justseem to want to watch television or play games on the computer, they don't goanywhere and hardly walk anywhere.I do feel that technologyrules people\u2019s lives these days, including children, and while it is a goodthing, it can take over your life if you are not too careful.It does bother me that future children will grow up, not knowing what fun is, and life will be very tame for them. Yes falling out of a tree hurts when it happens, but you soon learn from the experience, and do things in a different way the next time round.",

        "content": "This week in Parliament, Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke tabled a debate on improving dementia care and services in the UK.During the debate, Norman Lamb MP, Minister for Care Services, signalled that momentum from the National Dementia Strategy for England must be sustained beyond 2014. When referring to the end of the strategy he said: 'It is absolutely clear \u2013 that something must follow; there must be a continuation.'As a person with dementia who worked on this National Dementia Strategy, alongside many other people, I confess that I am a little staggered to see many things we agreed on, simply not happening at all. It took a long time to get this organised and launched, and we all thought that was the hard part, but I think manywereproved wrong. The PCTs were simply not ready or in agreement for this simply because it was not mandatory in the first place. Some made many changes while others lagged behind, but now we need them all on board for the benefit of all who have dementia.If we have a National Strategy then please make it mandatory, so that it happens in all corners of England and not just where it suitsIts my own personal view that while the National Dementia Strategy is a wonderful thing, it did not go far enough, and many things were left open rather than making them mandatory.We are still seeing people with dementia being badly treated and abused, in places like care homes, simply because their staffare unskilled in dementia care, and the care home owners refuse to train their staff because it costs them money and time.This is very wrong as care home places cost a lot of money in the first place, but it proves that the standard of care is not going up with the costs.I get annoyed when I hear these care home managers and owners, say that they can not afford to train their staff, because to me its their right to do the training, and they should not be licenced as care homes, if their staff are not trained properly, and their operators licence should be revoked.These people who abuse people with dementia are nothing short of criminals, and should be treated as criminals, because they are abusing those who cannot fight back or in many cases help themselves.I also feel that the money for the strategy was not ring fenced, which allowed many around the country to use it for other projects, something which was fundamentally wrong. If you put money into a project then it should be ring fenced to protect its misuse.General training also need to be ramped up so that its mandatory in all PCTs and doctors surgeries etcWe are now seeing Nurses being trained in universities in how to cope with people who have dementia, but PCTs are not enforcing this, simply because it costs money, and this should be enforced around the country so that the same care is received in all areas of the NHS and the private care system.When this happens we may well get somewhere.But I do hope that this government carries on with the Strategy and makes it run for another 5 or so years, so that dementia care reachesthe right standards around all of England not just certain sectionsIts up to us all to make it happen, by forcing the Members of Parliament to listen to our concerns where dementia is concerned. Go out and tell your local MP now, we must keep the strategy going for another 5 plus years and then we will see some wonderful changes. ",

I forgot people\u2019s names at work, and on two occasions forgot where I wasgoing, when I was walking to work, a route I had walked for well over 10 years.I would attend meetings and would leave having no idea what had been said.My electrical exam papers which were in a file at home, made no sense at allwhen I looked at them. In fact it all looked like a foreign language, and thatwas distressing, but our daughter kept saying, let it go, but how could I itwas my job.Yes they all guessed that there was something going wrong, but like myselfnever expected anything like early onset Lewy Body Dementia, and like me theyall thought it was an illness that only the elderly got. I kept saying, I am going mad.During this time my wife had a running battle with our doctor who was adamantthat I was just depressed, and my wife was adamant that I was not, as she hadseen and worked with people in that condition. She then demanded a second opinion,and then things started to move, but all this was now starting to have aneffect on my children as well as my job and my dear wife.As things moved on our daughter wasmore engaging that our Son, but perhaps that was because she had just leftUniversity and had a degree in Biology, and could look at things in a differentway. Where our son was out of the link so to speak, difficult to get through to,but I guess that was because he either understood or accepted the diagnosis.He has now changed and is very supportive, even thoughthere are times whenI think he is still unsure about what is going on.After the 3 grandchildren came along my Daughter spent time discussing myproblems, with them, although they struggled at times, but they are trulywonderful and supportive of me, so much so that I cannot do anything wrong intheir eyes.Anything which goes wrong was not my fault but the illness you are livingwith.My daughter had problems describing the illness with the name of Lewy BodyDementia, so she chose instead to call it \"OLD TIMER'S\"So now whether I like it or not, anything which goes wrong is not my fault,you just have Old Timers, Grampy.Hard though it may be I have accepted this through the Grand Children, andtry to make sure that I don't let them think I am worse that I am. I have made light of the illness a few times, and have then come under thewrath of these Grand Children, for trying to do things that are impossible todo now.Each time I forget something, or try to remember what to do, when I am withthe grand children, one of them usually comes out as say's well, it\u2019s your oldtimers, don't worry we will help you.Leave that to us, you\u2019re not to do it or should not be trying to do that.Every time we go for a walk, there is a scrum, between the three of them, tosee who is going to hold my hand, as it seems all three want to help in any waythey can. These children are so protective of me that it is sometimes very hard to cope with, but I know that they all mean well, its just so difficult to explain and understand in children that are so young.There is a strong bond between us all especially between, myself and theeldest who has a mild form Asperger\u2019s syndrome, and although we spend a lot oftime together while the two youngest sit and play, she also steps aside, to letsomeone else have some time with me. There is no doubt in my mind that young children are capable of getting togrips with illness like dementia, and seem to have an uncanny knack, ofunderstanding more than adults give them credit for. Perhaps this goes back towhen we were young, and were kept well away from Grandparents who had illnesslike this. I used to be very proud of my spelling and grammar, but nowthat\u2019s all on the way out, and I find it very distressing when I see sillymistakes. So when I spend time with the grand children doing spelling, it isvery hard, but one of them usually comes out with the same old excuse, you can beallowed to forget because you have old timers, we are learning these words andhave no excuse.These people were usually kept out of sight of everyone, and inso cases they here sent into cottage hospitals or institutions where they wentunnoticed largely because no one understood this illness, and in some casesmany thought that those with dementia were mad.Now we are seeing a sea of change and in some saes it is led by children,who want to know more about the illness, and although very hard to accept it iswonderful to know that it is happening.I often look back and wonder just how bad things got at home, before Iwas diagnosed, because in all honesty, I don't remember. I think I was sowrapped up in my problems at the time wondering what was going on that I didnot think of anything or anyone but myself.I don't think I was capable of understanding anything at that stage,because there was very little support, apart from my dear Wife and Daughter,and that carried on until I was finally diagnosed.Although I was under strict instructions from my daughter, never tostop and give in to the illness, otherwise she would come back home, and sortme out. While she was around she never allowed me to sit and worry in any room,but would try to keep me occupied on one thing or another, and I will be eternallygrateful to her and my wife for all the support they gave. My son these days although still struggling to come toterms with my illness, does try at times to get to know more about what ishappening, but I do think that he is so emotional that he is frightened of whatwill happen in the end.So in all families we all see dementia from differentangles, and although it may be hard to cope with when you have the illness, Ihave no doubt now that it is harder for our families to cope with as they arewatching our every move. Yes this is a horrible illness, but I do think that it has brought the family together, and has made them stronger, and if everyone has Grandchildren like this, we will soon remove the stigma from dementia because it's children like this, who will remove it in the future. They will also raise the profile of dementiaso that its at the Front where its seen, rather than Out of Sight.I never thought I would see the day when I would see any Grandchildren , now I have four, and they really makelife worth fighting for, along of cause with my dear wife, daughter and son",

But we must notforget the voices of those with the illness, their carers, family members and friends who all have a role in teaching people about dementia.We cannot take everything we see in textbooks as gospel, because some of it may well be out of date or written by someone with little or no knowledge if the illnessI occasionally go to speak to the students about living with lewy body dementia, and acarer goes to speak about her life with her husband, when he had dementia before he died.These stories can play a big part in all training as it comes from those at the front so to speak. We should also remember that there is no one size fits all, training scheme where dementia is concerned, as there are too many variations. There may well be 10 or so different types of dementia, but within that there are well over 120 variations, and no two people have the same problems or symptoms, so this training has to be well planned and set out. We all go our separate direction, so in many cases this illness is not a text book illness, as many think.Dementia has been a subject which has been largely hidden away by society for too long and now its time for it to be brought out of the shadows. Its time it was discussed in many places so that these young people who are our future can do something positive about raising the profile of the illness.",

        "content": "Some time ago I looked at this subject and could not get my head around it very well, so I am having another goI am wondering whether it is beneficialfor people with dementia to use social media, and I think it does by the number of individuals with this illness using blogs, and social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook.Of course there are various places we can go and I don't know them myself so cannot discuss themA few years ago I was told by my consultant towrite my life story as a way of keeping my brain active. I then noticed and got involved with social media websites as a way of finding out more about my illness, Early Onset Lewy Body Dementia.Since then I have found many new friends around the world who were doing the same thing, and we all share the information, on a regular basis.However this can cover a very large area and many websites, chat rooms and blogs.BlogsBlogging allows you to write down items about you and your illness, without expecting anyone to answer.My consultant told me, that by writing my problems down it would help me to come to terms, with some of them.It also helps me to look at the other problems we face on a daily basis, such as negative media reports about miracle cures, which are then shot down in flames by researchers. Many of these things cause us a lot of upset and disgust, as we have an illness which has no known cure, and these headlines are down just to sell newspapers, and nothing elseBlogging allows you to look at what is happening around the world where dementia is concerned, because I get some interesting answers at timesFacebookFacebook is somewhere where we find teenagers etc, who are very interested in learning more about Grandfathers or Grandmothers illness, without being told by parents that its none of your business, or you simply don't understand.There are many groups on facebook relating to dementia, so its a good place to go for help and support from people in the same position, although we must remember that we may have a similar form of dementia but we may alsohave vastly different symptomsTwitterTwitter seems to a be far reaching web news website, where any news gets maximum coverage at the click of a button.While not everyone can benefit from social media as they simply were not diagnosed early enough, it is beneficial to many others. I was told to keep my brain active in the hope that it would not slow down, and although this is good advice it does not always work, as we all have good days and bad days, so its a case of doing what you can whileyou can.This has a faster response at times but to me its not as personal as the other websites, as you can also get people following who will never agree with anyoneDementia Websites and ChatroomsThese vary around the world, some are set up for all users, while others prefer to keep people with dementia in a separate section to caregivers or carers. This is for various reasons, but I think the main one is that someCaregivers think that because they have looked after one person with dementia, they know it all, and this causes a lot of upset, among those with the illness.The reason being that there may be around 12 types of dementia, but within that there are over 120 variations, so whatever happens no two people with the same form of dementia have the same symptoms or problems, so no one answer fits all. I did once speak about social media at one event, and was then spoken to by a professor in dementia, who then said that some of these chat rooms can have the wrong effect on people with dementia.After his discussion I understood where he was coming from, because although most caregivers or carers are trying to do their best to help us, one or two, push the boundaries too far and cause problems.I have not come across this type of thing recently so I do not know if it still goes on.But many chat rooms do a very good job, in supporting people with the illness and their loved ones, and long may they carry on.There are also a few very good websites which areonly for people with dementia. I have visited one or two, but my spelling and grammar are not what they used to be so I cannot go there now as I don't wish to make myself look silly.I know we all make mistakes, but I always had pride in my spelling and grammar, so when it slips, you feel like giving up altogetherSo to me these places do a wonderful job, providing of course that we can all use the computer and have access to the internet.

They feel so alone, and tend to ask why its them who have the illness.By stepping forward to discussing our problems we are all helping them to understand that they are certainly not alone, but among friends who also have the illness.Many people have said in the past, that they will not go to a charity, but want to speak to people who really know what its like to live with the illness, somewhere where they can share problems, and ideas of how to get around everyday problems whichwe all struggle with at various times of the day, and I tend to agree with thisI have at times spoken to people working for some dementia charities, and its been blatantly obvious that they did not really have a clue about dementia, and in many cases thought that there was only one type of dementia, therefore we are all the sameIF ONLY THEY REALLY KNEWHowever by working with these charities, talking to them, and alongside them, we can make a vast difference, and encourage everyone to accept their illness, and then move on to a new way of living while they have the chance. But I am hoping that through the next year we can make a real difference and help people come to terms with their illness, and be more outspoken, thereby helping others understand, that we are all in the same boat.

I was supposed to say that for some reason I have becomevocal, where before I was always quiet.But the shutters came down, my mind went blank, and I lost my place.When I realised I said the first thing that came to mymind, and that was that I had become very \u201cpolitical\u201d rather than vocal.This completely threw me in the wrong direction, becauseI had not meant to say that I had become politically vocal, but it\u2019s the way itcame out.I then had to attempt to apologise when my wife pointedthis out.But it really made me wonder how many times this hashappened over the last few years. My wife has told me that it\u2019s happened a few times, butshe thought nothing of it at the time, but after this event she pointed it outto the audience after the event, and it was accepted, but everyone that I knowof.A few people said that they have noticed this with otherpeople who have dementia, so perhaps it\u2019s part of our problem getting the rightwords out, without upsetting anyone, however I know that is easier said thandone.Sometimes when I panic trying to think of an answer to aquestion I have been asked on the spur of the moment. Either the wrong wordscome out, or the right words in the wrong order.When this happens we go off on the wrong direction, andthat causes more problems as someone usually takes it totally the wrong way.

However many people start off without families or friends, and when the illness comes, they have no one to talk to at all.  So they get more and more lonely and isolated as the days go by, either because they have not had a formal diagnosis, or they have not been picked up by the services and charities. So life for these people must be very difficult, because they will have no support with things like shopping or getting advice about problems they face on a daily basis.There is another side to this, and this concerns people who have loved ones around them. It\u2019s a well-known fact now, that even though they have support, they still feel isolated and alone, or lonely at times, and this is caused by problems associated with dementia.I have had many occasions when I could not think clearly for anything up to an hour or more, it was just a black hole, and I could not think of anything at all, the words would not come, or I simply could not think of anything to say which would make any sense. It was like being isolated from society and my family.Its times like this that we all feel totally isolated and lonely, because we cannot get out of a horrible situation. This can also be caused by us misinterpreting something that was said to us by a loved one or friend. Our brain picks it up the wrong way and we end up stepping into the crevasse.I often think it would be wonderful if there was a buddy system, where we could either ring up or go and see someone else who has the illness, where we could talk about it and find solutions.I know that some small Dementia charities provide a service where they use buddies who can support and advise us, but these are few and far between.I am sure that if a national buddy system were to be set up, many people who are lonely would feel a lot better, and may even join in at local groups or day services, where they would feel welcome and among friends.This is also a service that local churches could set up, if they knew that people were lonely and needed friendship and support. Who knows but this could also encourage lonely people to go and join in at these local church services and gain more friends.   I look to the future when loneliness will be a thing in the past especially where dementia is concerned    ",

This period of my life was very difficult to come to terms with, but the consultant thinks that this book and its ties to the Scouting movement saved me, and got me going, into a nicer world. Although that period of stress and torment, will probably stay with me for as long as I am aliveWe all shared a common bond, and that was to become better people,  sharing everything we had in life, and sharing the experience of growing up with many others, from all walks of life no matter what, school they attended, whether from rich or poor backgrounds, nothing made any difference to us at the time. At the time I suppose I never really thought much about it, as it was learning new skills, intended to get you through life as a teenager, but when I think about it, it has formed my into the person I am today. It made me a better person, and helped me through many situations in life, because every time you got stuck your brain would go back automatically, and allow you to think of ways to do certain thingsIt also gave us the grounding in the true meaning of being loyal to everyone from God to the Queen, our leaders, friends and families. It was here that I learnt to cook properly, to map read and follow instructions, and also lead people from the front. It also made us better citizens, and many of the old friends I have met since those days have not changed very much, yes we are a lot older, but those basic principles still remain with us after all of those years, and that is amazing.I wonder just how many people around the world were brought up the same way amd still have the same principals today, and even tough I have dementia, its still a major part of my life.

When my wife and I arrived we were welcomed by the parish priest and his wife, and were shown around the new church buildings, and really made feel like guests of honour, but at the same time it made me feel relaxed, and ready for whatever came.However during the interval of the event, when I was unsure what the response would be from comments I had passed about Dementia in the Society and the Church, but I was amazed that many of the people said that they welcomed my comments, which had made them realise just how out of touch they were as far as dementia is concerned. Judging by the looks on some faces, not everyone in the room shared their views, but then we can not win them all over in one goAlthough one church Priest said that they were doing something to makepeople with dementia feel at home by using the traditional services etc.I was also asked if I would attend two other future religious events where dementia would be the main topic, and may be asked to speak. One of theseis for a local group of clergy, where they feel the services could and should be altered to suit people with dementia.I was not at all sure whether I was stepping into a Lions den with this, but I suppose that others with dementia may well be struggling to cope with religious services these days, so if I can help them I then feel as if I have achieved something goodI do feel that if we can change the way Churches treat us, we are well on the way to achieving a dementia friendly country, so if I am asked to speak at other places including churches, I will have to consider this, as we must change the way people with dementia are treated.I know that it will never happen, but If I was asked to speak to a Bishop etc, I may well feel as if I have started the ball rolling, because these people have the power to help us.Writing to them simply is not the answer, I did that once and did not get a decent response",

        "content": "Dementia care is led these days by professionals from various backgrounds,all with vastly different ideas, as to what is needed as far as carers andpeople with dementia are concerned. Yet I do wonder whether they actually ask those with the illness what they reallywant, or do they as we all know, justtake it for granted that they know best, something that is well wide of themarkI get tired of hearing these people say, that we need this or that, when inmany cases it\u2019s all down to what they want themselves and not people with theillness.We have to fit into their, one size fits all group, and if we don't thenthey say we are being stubborn or awkward.I know that if they bothered to ask us, the people with dementia, theywould get a different answer all together.I do feel that their ideas are being pushed on to us because they cost less,and take up less timeDementia care these days is big money, but the money does not go into thecare or staff training, it goes on the shareholders, and that to me is so verywrong because many of these people simply don't care what service they areproviding, as long as they get some money coming in, and in this case, it\u2019s atthe expense of those with dementia.It annoys me in the first place, that many don't even bother to ensuretheir staff are properly trained, to cope with dementia patients, but this isfor two reasons as I have been told on many occasions. One is that it\u2019s not mandatory to train carer staff, as far as thisGovernment or the last was concerned.The second is that many care providers think that it\u2019s up to the staffthemselves, to get trained in their own time. I do admit that one or two goodcarer providers actually train their staff on site, or allow staff to study intheir breaks, by using the business computers. But as far as many are concerned, this is simply because they don't want towaste the company\u2019s money on training staff, when it could all go toshareholders. However I do think that manycompanies would learn a lot, if they asked people with the illness to go in tospeak to their staff, as I found out a few years ago.This is because they then learn more about the illness first hand rather thanreading old out of date textbooks, which imply that we all just sit in a chairand don't do anything but watch television all day. That may well be fine in the mid to later stages, but in many cases peopleneed inspiring, and that again comes with good quality training and experience.However there are many misconceptions about Dementia.Thatthis illness is age related? Sowhat about the thousands of people under the age of 65 who have a diagnosis ofdementia Therewell over 16,000 people under the age of 65 who have this illness, some intheir 30s.Peoplewith dementia cannot speak, or take an active part?Peoplewith dementia are unable to get involvedThese are all things whichhelp keep this horrible stigma which is attached to dementia alive.Howwrong can they be, and perhaps this is why many places, care homes, religiousplaces, etc. are not encouraged to make things easier for us to get involved Please remember that these people may not saya lot, but their actions speak volumes. I always remember seeingpeople with Alzheimer\u2019s disease at meetings, they rarely said much, perhaps dueto pressure of getting things right in their minds.In some cases their wives orfamily spoke up for them, without thinking and allowing the person time to speakfor themselves. But their actions did all ofthe answering, nodding, smiling or giving a thumbs up in agreement, or shakingtheir heads or hands when they disagreed. They still had feelings,ideas, of what was happening, and what is more they still have a sense ofpurpose and the meaning of life, along with that small word with a big meaningHOPE.This has always stuck in mymemory, and proved that they knew exactly what was being said, even though theycould not speak. A goodquality of life is something we all cherish,and this should be encouraged among those who have this illness, and those whocare for us.These are just a few of the basic things we know about this illness, and ifwe the people with the illness can see it, why can't the professional\u2019s, or isit they simply don't care.I was once at a meeting where a high profile professor in dementia oncesaid to everyone. That no matter how many clinics\u2019 he attends, he always learns somethingelse knew about the illness. This made me realise that at least one person was honest enough, to admitthat he did not know everything about the illness and was willing to learn ashe went Whenever I do a talk, I always get care home staff coming up to me afterwards saying, we did not know that people with dementia could talk.Do they really believe that, or is it that people with dementia are ignoredand treated as if they are stupid by many care home owners.Yes we have an illness, but we areevery bit as good as those professionals, who think they know it all.So if you really want to know what it\u2019s like living with dementia, ask aperson with it and don't assume that you know better, because you could be verywrong.Even people with dementia can carry on new learning things, if they aregiven the chance and encouragement to do so. But it\u2019s all down to theprofessionals and Care staff and their quality training.I also think that governments could learn a lot about this illness, if theyhad people with the illness at meetings, and they listening to what they said,rather than the professionals and commissioners of services, who at the end ofthe day are just doing exactly what they want, no matter what is needed byothersNo matter which way we look at this the professional are those living withthe illness, as they know exactly what life is like, and also what they want toallow them to live a life in betterconditions.",

Its taken me a few weeks to go over the the lastpresentation about Spirituality in Dementia, and then update and rewrite it, beforegetting it edited by my wife, so it was something I did not want to drop out of unless I was desperately ill.But I am now hoping that tomorrow things will go well, as this is my last presentation this year, so I don't want it to fail or go down badly.This topic is of great interest to many people these days, and its one that can be difficult to understand, something that took a lot of hard work to get started, but now I am enjoying doing it, alongside well know Clergy, who are interested in this subject.Enjoy the day as tomorrow is another day",

        "content": "Many like myself start out in life with a strong belief in their religion which ever one that may be depending on where they live and perhaps where they were brought up.However over the years they may well let these beliefs slide into the back ground either because, of a busy life style, or because their faith is sliding away from them.I think I fall into the second section, and that is because, I struggled to hang on to my religious beliefs when I was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia, partly because I lost control over my life as it was, and partly because there was little if any support from our religion, the Church of England.Today I don't think things are any better, simply because as many have said, the Church is either not geared up to support people with this illness or memory problems, or they simply don't care these days. Yet many of these people are elderly, the same people who keep many parish churches in funds on a regular basis, and once they give up the churches will end up closing , simply because of lack of care. Our church does not forget the elderly when they need more funds, as they are the first ti be asked for more money, so is this totally wrong.Years ago the parish Priest or there Assistant whether a curate or deacon, would always go to see the sick, and those in need, even though in those days they worked 5-6 days a week.These days in our parish they don't even work that, yet they say that they cannot afford the time to look at the needs of those who need support either religious or anything else.Yet the lay people do their work for them when asked, official or not I do not know, but by all accounts they are doing the work of the full time clergy.When I became ill I was startled by the fact the I could not remember the Lords Prayer something I knew from an early age, so I changed services at the church we were attending at the time, because it was quieter and more relaxing. Eventually after the diagnosis was confirmed, I lost my job as an engineer, and three weeks later my mother died, so the family decided that we should return to the family home which was now empty.On our return I had to go through the process of the diagnosis all over again, because the first hospital had lost all of my notes. But on completion of that I was given medication to help me through my illness. After around 6 months I returned to the church where I had grown up in, and had been in the  choir for around 10 years, thinking life would return to near normal.I then found to my horror that the words I had struggled to learn all over again \" Lords Prayer\" did not match those being used at the service, in fact the whole service was vastly different. The same happened over the next few weeks with different variations of Lords Prayer etc, so much so that I wondered what I was doing there. During this time I had also lost the ability to sing and follow the words in a hymn book etc, so life was very difficult.My wife spoke to the Parish Priest, who simply shrugged his shoulders, as if to say , so what.There idea is that if services are changed around people don't get bored, or something like that.So in the end I simply gave up and my religion went by the board.I was very sad when this happened, because it proved that the comments I had heard from everyone else, bore out my thoughts, that the church of England no longer cared about anyone with brain or memory problems.I desperation I wrote to a Bishop thinking I would get a good reply, perhaps I was stupid or nieve, but I got a shock when the reply came back, as he obviously did not read my letter.I had explained that I have problems with very graphic nightmares and dreams during the night, and don't get to sleep properly until around 5 am in the morning. But he told me to get up and go to the 8am service on a Sunday where I would have no further problems. what is the point of going somewhere when you are very tired and cannot think straightAfter this I have not been back, and have no intention of returning, to a place where people don't care.I have learnt since then that people like the Methodists, have vastly different ways of dealing with this and are more caring easy to follow, and what is more the sermons, are short and to the point and not political as we see these days. So perhaps I will end up changing my religion, if that's what it takes to enjoy a good quality of lifeOur old canon used to tell people in the 1960s that if you cannot do a sermon  and get your point over in 10 minuets, then you are not up to the job. Make it short and too the point.Its so sad that the church cannot fulfil this part of my Spirituality, but perhaps I have many other parts that I can look back on with great pride.All I can say is that there is little wonder that the churches these days are in a mess, and perhaps its only a matter of time before they all close and end up as museums or public houses.",

The associated cost to the UK economy is \u00a323 billion a year, which is expected to reach over \u00a350 billion by 2040.One of the ways Alzheimer\u2019s Society is responding to this challenge is to work with key partners and the people affected by dementia to develop \u2018dementia-friendly communities\u2019. This involves raising general awareness about dementia; encouraging carers and people with dementia to seek help and support; and helping people to maintain independence and control over their lives through community inclusion.Academics from the health and social care, built environment, arts, media and robotics professions are collaborating across the University to share their teaching and research expertise on dementia while taking positive action to enable people to stay independent for longer.One outcome of this work is the creation of a robot by Antonio Espingardeiro, a PhD researcher, which has the ability to remind elderly people to take their medication and to exercise. It can also provide 24-hour emergency notifications and directly connect to carers or GPs through video conference or SMS.University researchers are using design to help people living with dementia by creating environments that support everyday living in settings such as hospital wards, homes and gardens with the aim of maximising independence and reducing frustration.Students and staff are encouraged to become \u2018dementia friends\u2019, which involves recognising the signs of the illness, understanding what it is like to live with dementia and taking action such as spending more time with someone affected by the condition. It is also important to support staff and students who are caring for someone with dementia.The Salford Dementia Action Alliance was launched this week at MediaCityUK. Alliance members which include the University, Alzheimer\u2019s Society, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, office of Hazel Blears MP, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, TUC, local care homes, business and other charities and services will work together to improve the lives of people with dementia.Professor Maggie Pearson, the University\u2019s Pro Vice Chancellor for Public Benefit and Dean of the College of Health & Social Care, will chair the Salford Dementia Action Alliance.

        "content": "I have been involved in many government plans for Dementia, and I confess, that I have little or no confidence in what they do. To me its all down to them looking good, without doing very much.In one notable occasion, the launch of the National Dementia Strategy. After the launch, I asked the minister who was there, about the amount of NEW MONEY, being put into the strategy. He said NONE, as its already in the system, \"and only needs to be better spent\".Yet they had publicly said that money would be available to get the Strategy off the ground, and at a meeting the other day people were genuinely asking if the strategy had actually done anything positive in the UK, when we see all of the sad cases of people with dementia being abused, in hospitals and care homes.We should have had mandatory training for all care staff, whether the care home owners liked it or not.We then saw councils like Durham, getting money to grit roads all courtesy of the National Health Service and the Strategy. Why because the government did not and would not ring fence the money for the strategy, so can we ever believe anything they say about dementia. That to me is something quite fundamental, if its not ring fenced, it can be used for anything within the Health Service and no one would ever know or question it.Perhaps I am becoming cynical in my old age, but I cannot see this Tory Government being any better, simply because of the way they are treating the poorer classes in society.They are hitting the disabled and the poor with what is called the bedroom tax, making sure that two people sleepin one bedroom, even thoughone of them many well be disabled or have dementia, and may well needto sleep in a second bedroom. This alsoallowscarers to have a good nights sleep, because many of us with dementia do not sleep well at all, so this must havea knock on effect with our carers and loved ones.While there may be people out there with bigger homes than they really need, I do feel that people with dementia etc, or the disabled, are being victimised by the Governement.Yet the wealthy of which Mr Cameron is one, get away without paying their full tax, and in some cases it is known that many in this country get away without paying much tax at all, because they use off shore accounts.If all of the wealthy paid their way in this country for once, we would have a fairer system, as more money could be put into the system.These politicians simply don't understand what the poorer classes aregoing through in the first place, and in my own view are simply making them selves feel good, by having a Prime ministers challenge in things like dementia. Many people in the UK these days are struggling to pay for theirbills due to the big cartels who are putting the bills up every few months, without needing too, and the government is letting them do it.Then we hear that politicians get their energy bills paid for, care of the government, something I cannot accept or understand. One last week wasfound to be getting hisenergy bills paid forwhen it was for his home and stables.If Joe public did that he would end up in prisonIt seems to be a class system all over again, and it will never change as long as millionaires are elected to run this or any other country, because they are only filling their own pockets.I admit to having voted conservative all my working life before the diagnosis of dementia, but I have never seen such a bad government in this country as the one we have today. I now know that like many other people, I will never vote for them again after this, as they claimed they were there for the people.It leaves me wondering when the next new political party will emerge, and one that really cares for the values of the working and poorer classes, because in all honesty, all three parties in the UK are so similar, that too many people we have nothing but three Tory partiesIf we must have reviews of health issues like dementia, then let us have the money ring fenced to stop it being used for the wrong reasons, and let it be all NEW MONEY, not what many are calling money laundering by governments, allowing them to carry on saying that its already in the system.I was never political in any way, until I got involved with the governments of dementia issues, but now its really getting to me. Perhaps that's just one of the changesthat dementia brings with it, I don't know, or perhaps like may other people these days, I am starting to see things I don't likein all politicians, the same peoplewho claim to be helping us, yet do and say what they want, thinking we are all stupidThe day we get a prime minister standing up and saying quite clearly, that his Government is putting new money into good quality research in Dementia, and Dementia Services rather than wasting it on things like HS2 etc, something which just is notneeded,then I and many other people will be very happy.I want nothing better than new money put into dementia and good safe guards to ensure thatthat money is ring fenced for dementia onlyLet us have all care home stafftrained officially and properly, in looking after dementia patients, to stop the abuseAll nursing staff to be trained in dementia, as they are doing at Northumbria and other UniversitiesAll Doctors to be given more training in dementiaThe Government said this week, that its going to prosecute any one in care homes and hospitals, who abuse anyone with dementia etc, then put them in prison.Lets be brutally honest, if we prsosecute those who abuse dementia patients, as have heard over the last few years, the time will come when it will all stop, but for the wrong reasons.Not because its not happening, but because it will never get out into the press, because as weall know, there will be a mass cover up. Lets have good quality meaningful reviews, with safefguards and regulations which mean something, otherwise we will never change things for the best,Its time to move Dementia forward with positive headlines which mean something, and not political feel good headlines.",

Ihad a bad one three weeks ago and realised that I was going up the wall, and was doing and saying things that hurt my wife, or at least I did after I did it.I honestly do not know how this happens but it is hurtful to everyone around, at the time, as we do things which are totally out of character.I have been diagnosed as having another yesterday, so that must be about the sixth one this year, and its getting me down.I thought I was alright in the morning apart from being chesty, having a horrendous headache and coughing up loads of rubbish. Wethenwe went out shopping where I went dizzy and ended up hanging on to the shop shelves for securityAfter a while my wife rang the doctors to get an appointment before theyclosed for the weekend. But these people seem to have vastly different ideas, each time you see the doctor that is in the clinic whenwe go, and this does not help anyone.Fine I was not being rude yesterday, but if it had started over the weekend my wife would have been stuck.This is all made worse by the problem that I have had asthma ever since my working days, and I suppose this does not help. I saw one doctor a few years ago, when I was ill, and had breathing problems, and he was the rudest person I have ever met. He turned and said, what do you expect with that chest of yours. He told me that there was no infection possibly just a cold, something I knew it was not. But I was asked to do a sputum test just to make sure he was right.A few days later we had a telephone call to say that the results had come back, and I had to go to the doctors for a prescription which made me wonder just what was going on. I went to the chemists where I was told that that these were very strong antibiotics if there was no problem. So I never saw that doctor ever again, and will never see he home while I am still about to speak. That was the second occurrence with him and it will be the last.I know that my lungs have been the cause of many problems over the years, from a collapsed lungwhile I was workingto viral pneumonia a few years ago, and after each examination I am told that I have a lot of crackling.My wife remembers a few years ago, it being stated that if this carries on I would need a lungexamination, something I don't really fancy, but if it sorts it out fine, but why was this not on the records. It seems that they only write certain things on medical records, so if they are not passing items like this on is it any wonder we have problems.My mother used to say that I had a horrible smokers type cough from the age of three, so my chest must have been bad all those years ago.But justhow many people with dementia etc, worked in construction and engineering industriesusing dangerous products and find they are now paying for it, as well as having dementia I have worked in many places where asbestos was used, cut and also sprayed on ceilings, and all we had for protection was a cloth mask. I also worked on many other products which were dangerous, but I guess I never gaveit much thought as the information was not there at the time, or it was hidden from us. But these days we see all of this information everywhere we look.SoI guess that I am not the only one who has problems with people like this, but it does not help our loved ones who have to pick the pieces up at the end of the day.",

But I have proved that anything is possible when you are diagnosed early enough and get the support medically and from other sources, so I would recommend everyone who can do it, to go for it and fight all the way. I am not ready to give in yet, but will take life a lot easier, and spend more time with my family while I can still enjoy their company. I have had the extra pleasure of meeting many new friends over the years, and will look back on this with pride. I have also watched the film about \"Walking with the Wounded\" about how injured service people, walked to the North Polewith false arms and legs, and that proves to me that anything is possible if you really tryTheSo never allow yourself to give in, show what its possible to do and enjoy yourself, the world is your oyster.

My problem is that as itsa locum, I am not sure what they will do, until a new consultant is in place.Our last consultant left for a new hospital,early this year and a replacement has not been found yet, and she was so good and will be missed by many patients and staff.I am not sure whether my medication needs to be increased, to stop this, we shall just have to wait and see what happens, and see what they say, because I don't want this to go on over Christmas, as that would horrible. We also have our wedding anniversary this week, and I am dreading that, in case I upset my wife again, that would be too much to take, even though I know I am not in control of my brainEven shopping has been a nightmare this week, and I got to the stage where I really did not want to go out, but that would be giving in completely to this illness and I am not ready to do that just yet. I went to a dementia play at Northumbria University the other day, and enjoyed it although getting there was grim as Newcastle was full of students, or young people who seemed to be getting in the way all of the time. But perhaps that's just my spacial awareness problems and not them.The play was well done and informative to all of the student nurses who were there, and the all seemed to enjoy it.We are going to our daughter's for a few days so hopefully that will help things a little, especially seeing the three other grandchildren.",

Because in my opinion that leaves them open to the personwith dementia or any other illness taking them to court for neglect of their duties.I gave up driving when the illness started and while I wasstill working, because I had no support, from the medical profession and wasnot given either advice or medication. This caused some problems at work, butit was then that my wife realised something was wrong with meA year later when we had moved back to our family home, Ihad to be re-diagnosed because the original hospital had lost my notes, butonce this was done I was give advice about living well with the illness, andwas also given medication, which in all honesty I did not expect to work.After around 18 months I realised that I was or seemed moreswitched on some ways than the vast numbers of motorists driving in our area ofthe UK, so I took the bull by the horns and re applied to get my drivinglicence back. I agreed with my wife at the time that I would never driveunless I felt up to it, and if I ever felt odd or unwell, I would stop the carwhen it was safe and get out. I have driven by myself on occasions but only shortdistances, and I did this so that I felt comfortable if an emergency arose athome. However many people simply don't give up driving, eitherbecause they have driven all of their lives, and don't see anything wrong withtheir own driving, and why would they, or they simply don't listen to thosearound them, who say they should give up because their driving standards havedropped to a level where it is classed as unsafe.I knew one person who kept driving even though, someone hadto sit next to them, and tell them which corner to drive around, somethingwhich shocked me.I started driving in 1968, and even in 2003 when thingsstarted to go wrong, I decided in my own mind even though my employer got veryupset, that I was giving up driving, and it never really bothered me. The reason was that, I was more concerned about hitting orkilling someone else that I was about me being able to drive, and this hasstill stuck in my mind.Yes I have my licence back but only on a yearly basis, andif it goes, well so what, it\u2019s not the end of the world, as I have had all ofthe years extra through the medication, and that means more to me than anythingelse, especially seeing my Grandchildren grow up.However in this day and age, I am staggered to see so manyyoung drivers on the roads these days, who do intensive driving courses in veryshort times, and don't really get a lot of experience in all conditions as weused to do. Is that why so many of them are killed their first few yearsor months of driving. I look around at many of these and think that its timesomething was done, to sort the standard of driving out once and for all. Isimply don\u2019t see how someone doing an intensive driving course over a week or amonth can possibly pass a driving test, as you cannot learn everything aboutdriving a car in that time. Apart from that people can pass a test and then step into ahigh powered car which to me is barbaric, because there is no way that they canfeel in control of a high powered car. Surely like a motor bike, they should go through a processand step up when they are competent to do so, or when someone else says theyare ready to do so.But are these young motorists any safer than someone with a neurologicalillness? I don\u2019t think so, yet many people with these illness may feel understandablyvictimised, when they see some young hooligan tearing around the roads withlittle or no concern for others.I do know many people who have some form of dementia whodrive quite a lot, and these people have had the illness longer than I have,and some of these youngsters really get at them, because they are drivingcarefully rather than racing. I do know many people who have some form of dementia whodrive quite a lot, and these people have had the illness longer than I have,and some of these youngsters really get at them, because they are drivingcarefully rather than racing. I do know that some areas of the UK have driving courses where people withthe illness can go for and assessment, to see if they are competent to drive,and that to me is a brilliant idea. As long as the person listens to what is said by the instructor, and agreesto give up if they are classed as unsafe. Perhaps everyone should have a drivingassessment these days, dementia or not. It\u2019s now time to reapplyfor my licence again, so it\u2019s a case of wait and see whether I am allowed todrive again after Christmas, or whether it\u2019s back to the poor man\u2019s taxi \u201cTheLocal Bus\u201d But if it comes to that well so be it.

On some occasions I have got out of bed, and gone to a different room simply to break the cycle or at least try to. I say that because when we wake up from these horrors as I call them, its difficult to decide the difference between the nightmare andreality. I have at times resorted to doing things like hitting the wall so that I know I am awake, but then that leads to sore hands the next morning.Sometimes after doing something like watching television for half an hour, I have returned to bed only to find the whole process start again from the point it stopped. That is also very sad as I get out of bed feeling very tired and stressed.When I have these really bad horrors during the night, I can usually remember the whole thing in great detail for at least two days afterwards, and I have written about these before, as a way of trying to find out what is causing it all to happen.I often wonder why it is people having these don't end up having a heart attack as they are so bad, perhaps they do and its not looked into as to why it happened. I was once given medication, which was supposed to control it all, but found it got so bad that this had to be stopped altogether, because I simply could not wake up, and in the end tried to climb out of a bedroom window to get away from this bad horror. Luckily for me the windows were locked, because I was in a hotel and our room was on the third floor.However I understand that people who have this form of dementia struggle with some medications, so they are only used as short trials. I recently had a very bad night which shook me rigid afterwardswhen I looked back at it.It had been a very bad night and I can remember getting out of bed on two or three occasions, and sat in the room next door until I felt safe to return to bed. However each time I returned to bed the same horror started all over again.Eventually I did wake up, and went to have a cup of tea, at which point it dawned on me, that I had never actually left the bed during the night, I had only dreamt I had, which accounted for the nightmares going on so long. I was then so shocked about this that the next night, I did not want to go to bed, because I kept thinking, what if I thought I had woken up and had gone to the toilet? The embarrassment would have been too much for me.So these days I live in fear of these nights, and what may or may not happen.On some occasions I do get up and go down stairs to write things for my blog, just to try to concentrate on something for a while, but I am nervous of waking someone else up, so I don't do it every night.",

These were things I never liked before and it was hard to work out. I also like Eric Clapton, something which was odd years ago.Then I noticed that my tastes in Food had changed completely, from being slightly conservative as my wife said, never eating any foreign curries or other food. To the present stage where I can eat anything, no matter who spicy or that it is, and what is more I would if left to my own devises eat things like this every day,The other day it was noticed that my political viewshave radically changed, something which came as a complete shockto me.I used to be conservative in my views but I think that came from the time that the conservatives were middle of the road unlike now where they are to the right. My mother was always conservative and my father being a miner was always labour, and as I was closer to my mother when I was younger I took her side of the argument and it stuck with me all of my working life.However now my views seem to have gone completely to the left and I simply don't understand it at all, because I was never like this.

It\u2019s believed there are about 3,300 people with dementia in Sunderland, with many of those still yet to be diagnosed. \u201cI think we have been, given the circumstances, very busy in the past year,\u201d said chairman Ernie Thompson. \u201cWe have become a registered charity and been successful despite the economic climate.\u201cWe want to continue both of the pilot schemes which have been very well received, so we are seeking further funding to do this.\u201d Members are hopeful they will scoop money after they entered the Echo\u2019s Do A Lotto Good campaign to win cash from the Big Lottery Fund. Dr Paul Donaghy, a clinical research associate at Newcastle University, was at the meeting to talk about research into dementia treatments in front of the assembled audience. Deputy Mayor of Sunderland, Coun Stuart Porthouse, also attended. He said: \u201cWe believe it is very important to help in promoting all the good work carried out by Action on Dementia Sunderland.\u201cIt\u2019s very important knowing that any money donated is spent on the residents of Sunderland.\u201cDementia is a disease that affects 820,000 people in the UK.\u201cMost people with dementia are over 65 and, therefore, affects many family members who become carers. \u201cDementia is very often a lengthy journey, often 15 years or more, and the more we can contribute to this very worthy charity, the more help can be done in the community.\u201d Well done to Ernie and his team, they have done so well since starting up and I am sure they will achieve their aim in the future",

        "content": "Some time ago I wrote a piece on dementia and spirituality, or what I saw as themeaning of this from a service users side of things. This took me around 4 weeks to write, simply because I couldnot be sure, what the topic was really about, even though I had been asked to give a talk about it. I also had problems at the time finding the right words, which did not helpSpirituality means different things to different people, but it seems that there is a lot of deep seated upsetabout this subject as many people think its about religion and nothing else.I suppose to me spirituality is about religion, but as a religious person, I did not wish to push my views onto anyone else as they are personalHowever after a lot of searching on the internet, followed by a lot of thinking over two days I came up with my idea which I used, and it was a big success, So much so that I was asked if people and institutions could use it for teaching. I had never considered this, and it came as a surprise, but it was a nice surprise and an honour, being able to help.AsI said before many people had problems with the religious side of the topic, but I feel that many of these problems go back to the days when a priest would spend time doing pastoral things in his or her parish, like going to visitthe sick in their homes or inhospitals. This does not happen these days, for various reasons, and its a topic which really annoys me at times, and I guess that it's this which annoys other people, so they will not discuss religious things withanyone.However when we look at it from a different angle, it's about what we enjoyed doing in life, and what want from life.The things which mean so much to us, and that is what we want to carry on with for as long as we can.To me looking back its a form of life story, or the story about the person with the illness, their like and dislikes along with the things they may well hate, its all part of lifes format, and part of our individual spirituality.As a person who has worked on Life Story work with the Life Story Network in the UK,I soon got into this talk, and encouraged others to het involved, as it helps us to learn so much about our loved ones, and many things we knew little or nothing about sometimes come to light, and we get a good picture of who the person is and where they came from. Of coursethis can also bring up things which theperson does not want in the public domain, this has to be considered before anything else.But all in all its this persons life story, and its their for their loved ones and families to read in the future as well as when they are being cared forI have learnt a lot about this now, and after the talk which was also a huge success, I am starting to look further into the subject on good days.I confess that I got emails from all over the world which was amazing, so many that I could not answer them all, so it proves that this subject is something dear to many hearts, and I was pleased and proud of being asked to do it in the first place.",

        "content": "I often wonder what has gone wrong since my diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia, but it would be easier to ask what has gone right.When I was working the Bursar at my College used to say that she was amazed, when things went totally wrong, because I seemed to go into overdrive and thrived on stressful times. In some cases she would say that I was unstoppable, because once I had got the bit between the teeth, I would work all hours to get everything back to normal, even working through the night to achieve it.I confess that I was shocked to hear that ,because as a University CollegeEngineer, I was responsible for all of the College Buildings, the services, including all of the Electrical, Gas Water, Ventilation and Air conditioning systems, along with all of the maintenance team and contractors, and was on call 24 hours a day.I know that times could be hard, especially when you were working through the night, and then up again at 6am to start on the normal day job, but it was my life and in some weird way I loved it.I suppose looking back at old diaries to remember all of this, I just went into overdrive and totally ignored the College High Officials, because I knew what was needed better than anyone else, and was allowed to get on with it. Although I gathered from notes that I never took any prisoners, so if any individual like an academic poked their noses into something they nothing about, they got a shock. The odd thing was thatI was protected by the Bursar, Treasurer etc, because I wasrespectedand kept my head downYes it was a stressful job but I loved it, the sad thing is that I don't remember a lot about it all now, its a bit like a faded dream. I suppose its like last years flood at home. That is a forgotten part of my life, I remember odd bits and that is the lot, so where my wife lives in fearof another flood, I can't really help her. I get occasional glimpses of the flood but nothing concrete, I don't know if that's good or bad.However these days, I have forgotten how to do the jobs that I used to do confidently doing my work,and many are so dangerous that I would not even go there. This includes all of my electrical training, which is a thing from the past, and even the electrical examination papers that I have seen look like a foreign language, and unreadable. I have managed to fit one electrical plug since leaving work, and my son had to check it as I was unsure as to whether it was done properly.I no longer take stress very easy these days, and that is very hardto cope with. I find that any stress sees me leaving the room, to find somewhere quiet.Yes I now get stressed and sometimes very agitated, so I have tried to steer clear of anything which sets me off. However finding the right words and answers at times can cause this, so I have to try to work things out in my brain before opening my mouth. Otherwise the wrong words come out, or the right words in the wrong order, leaving me feeling very annoyed with myself.I know that its all to do with the brain, but it does not help some days.I don't know if this is a major part of my illness these days, but I confess that there are days when this gets me down. I suppose in this day and age even the television is stressful as programmes like the BBC news are very biased and I find that so sad. I don't like to hear someone telling me what is right or wrong on Television, because I have a betteridea than some of these presenters, I just want the news as it is without some political biased on it. So I end up reading the news on the internet, where I can make my own mind up. I was never political or had any views on politics, but now like many who have this illness, I seem to have gone the other direction, which at times is confusing.Many people who have this illness end up with some form of depression too, but although I get stressed I don't think I am depressed, or depressed as I know it. I just want the stress to go away, but I suppose most of this is down to the lose of all my training and hobbies, the things I loved outside family life.",

        "content": "When I was told about Horses Mouth, I really did not knowwhat it was, nor did I understand what it was trying to achieve, however it soonbecame part of my life and found that as someone with this illness,I could reach out and help others whether they had dementia,were carers, or family members or friends.I had been asked to do this originally by contacts within the Department of Health in London, because they thought I had the right manner and was fairly careful about what I did and said, so it was an honour to give it a go, not expecting it to get as far as it did I have helped quite a few people and feel as if I havegained many new friends along the way.This is an independent and as far as I know its an International website, where people can go for impartialadvice about an illness, or problem at work etc, and no matter what the problemis there is always someone there to support you day or night, although I might add that I am not.Most of those on this website have experience in one form oranother, and although dementia is a big topic, we always try to help, but nevergive medical advice.The main problem is that although there are around 12different types of dementia, there are over 120 variations of the illness andeach person goes through the illness in vastly different ways with differentsigns and symptoms, so we are all individual in our own way. Many people think that because they know one person withdementia, that they know everything there is to know about the illness, butthis is far from the truth.I feel that it is sometimes a very good thing to havesomewhere like Horses Mouth, because when we get diagnosed with the illnesssuch as dementia you feel totally numb for a while, then after a while when it has sunk in,the questions come but there is usually nowhere to go for the answers.I saythis because many have said that they start to think of questions at night,when the help desks have closed down This is where websites like Horses Mouth come into theirown, as there are people there most of the time, and quite a few either havethe illness or have someone in the family who has it.The main problem I have come across is caused by the stigma in dementia, and some will not accept that they have the illness or that there is something wrong with themPeople in this case will not go to charities where someone may know them, so they go online and ask the questions. They are usually pointed towards the correct charity, in the end.I will point out that no one knows who I am, or anything else, and contacts are not allowed, just in case something goes wrong, or we get too involved, and I only give advice after thinking it through carefullyI will point out that I only do this on the days when I can think slowly and carefully, and nearly everyone in the end goes to the correct place whether it is there doctors, or a charity where they can get all of the help and support they really want, and once that happens I have achieved my goal.I have had experience of being in a post like this for a leading charity, and really enjoyed doing it.I also believe that many people could enjoy the experience of mentoring and supporting others in their in their time of need, and when it works well you really get a buzz and a sense of achievement, \u201cA Job Well Done\u201d.So I can recommend it to anyone who wants to become a mentor, and help others through a difficult time, while helping yourself in the process.

        "content": "There is alot of talk about the stigma of Dementia, and I think I would like to exploreit. It\u2019s taken a long time to write this but here goes.When I lookat all of this I am not sure whether stigma is the right word, I rather thinkthat it should be more like discriminated against, just like third classcitizens.When weconsider that 40years ago cancer was still a dirty word which was stigmatised,and people who had it were treated as if they had a dirty sexual disease,something we know it was not, and thankfully this has now changed. Dementia onthe other hand was always treated in many places as madness and I do not thinkit has changed to day in a lot of places. But this is due to lack ofunderstanding by the general public and lack of leadership by the governmentand some of the medical profession.I know that some in the Government circles arechanging things because a few years ago I was honoured to be asked to speak atthe Launch of the New Cross party group on dementia, and since then the grouphas grown and has some impact. When I look back, I can remember the storiesof people with dementia being locked up in mental hospitals etc., because theyknew very little about the illness and thought the wrong things. These poorpeople who have this horrendous illness are the victims and are treated likeold day lepers by Society. The stigmaattached to this illness is unreal and unacceptable in this day and age, as weare dealing with an illness which is not self inflicted or asked for and yet itseems that some of today\u2019s society treat us as if we had an infectious disease.Many people Ihave spoken to have this weird assumption that dementia is contagious, or easyto catch, when we know that it\u2019s not. There are many misconceptions aboutdementia, as many think that you become illiterate or irresponsible once youare diagnosed. Many thinkthat it runs in families, which it does not, and as far as I am aware no one inour family ever had dementia Like many Ilost many friends when I was diagnosed, as many have these ideas that once youhave been diagnosed you go down-hill fast, and or forget who you are talking toetc. Even now we have nieghbour\u2019s, who if they see my wife andI at the shops, will often ask her \u201chow I am\u201d when I am stood there, thinkinghello I am here and not a ghost. Needless to say I steer clear of people likethis as it hurts when this type of thing happensI supposemany of the problems are caused by websites which say that once you have adiagnosis your life is down to 5-8 years, when in fact through modernmedication which has been proved to help, life is that much longer, so theseplaces need to be upgraded.Someone Iclass as a dear friend in New Zealand, was diagnosed in 1993 and was given moreor less 5 years, yet she is still going and is still travelling the worldspreading the word and raising awareness, so that must prove something eventhough her x-rays and scans prove otherwise, as they show up, what is left ofthe deteriorated brain, yet she is going still and god willing she will last alot longer.So with luckall of these websites will change for the best thereby helping usWe need tore-educate the nation about the illness, so that everyone knows that we arenormal people, who had the misfortune to get an illness which closes the braindown. Once we haveachieved this people who have Dementia will start to admit that they have it,and talk about it rather than try to hide it. I was oncetold that I was a fool by admitting that I had this illness, but why if wedon\u2019t talk about it we will never remove that stigmaWe also needto get better services in England so that we get the same treatment andservices in all parts of the country and not as we see it today where it\u2019s apost code lottery. Care homesare now getting so expensive that our carers are now expected to look after usat home with little or no help from the government services.We are leftto support from charities, who have been short changed the by government as welland now, and find it increasingly difficult to find funds to keep going.Not onlythat, but the people who look after us, and care for us are treated with littleor no respect by the government.It\u2019s all well and good for Governmentministers to say that Carers save the economy millions a year, but they getlittle if any thanks after that, and some get very little support from socialservices when they need it as they seem to go deaf. Perhaps itwould be different if they themselves had a family member who had or hasdementia then they would respond fasterSadly nowpeople who self inflict are more liable to get better treatment than those whoare inflicted with a brain disorder such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Dementia.The costs of smoking and drink problems aresomething which is on the rise at a rapid rate and yet little is done to stopit. The NHS is indire straits these days and unless the self-inflicted problems are broughtunder control, illnesses like cancer and dementia will have their services cutback in the future, something which would be very sad and would have totallythe wrong effect.But we canchange this if we all work together and should do so in the hope that thisstigma goes one way or another. We should ifwe can go out and speak to those who are young and ready to take this illnesson board, whether it is schools, although teachers refuse to accept any onewith the illness to talk to their pupilsBut churchgroups, students, doctors if they really are interested, and any other groupswhere raising awareness can really do some good.I went tospeak to a group of doctors once and left feeling that it was a total waste oftime, as very few were interested and those were from Far East countries, theBritish doctors did not want to listen at all.I have offered and have spoken to many groupsnationwide, and they enjoyed to talks and presentations given because they weregenuine. All we ask attime is for the travel expenses, which can be expensive on long journeysIt\u2019s not ajob to us it\u2019s simply raising awareness.If you lookat websites like Face book these days, places where years ago, I would havesaid was geeks, and are now the places for illness like dementia. They do a lotof good work raising awareness and allowing groups to speak out.Thesechildren are sometimes too nervous to go to a charity, but on face book theyare anonymous, and they don\u2019t have to face anyone, they aresimply there because someone in the family has got dementia, and they wantdesperately to get involved and help out.Years ago their parents would have kept quietabout the illness and the children would never have heard anything about it, sothese are some of the people we need to target, as they are the future wheredementia is concerned, and they can help us to spread the wordI have heardit said many times that it hits the right cord and place when a presentation ortalk is done by someone with the illness, rather than a professional, althoughsome world argue the true professionals are those living with dementia, So let us usethese people with dementia and raise awareness while at the same time removingthis horrible stigma once and for all. If you reallywant to know what life is like having and living with this illness, ask them andnot someone else, don't assume that you know all of the answers.Let us all spread the word and raise awareness of thisillness and remove the stigma, so that it becomes a nasty word from the pastand is no longer used",

I can accept that some people may forget at timesthat we have these problems, but there are times when it does not make it any easier, and its very difficult to try to keep quiet, let alone tell them to disappear and leave you alone.Children seem to sense that you are concentrating and tend to steer clear, where adultsjump straight in with both feet, and give you a strange look when you get annoyed, because you have forgotten what you were writing or trying to say.It never bothered me when this happened before but I suppose its getting harder and harder to concentrate these days, and even harder to remember what I am trying to write or say.Perhaps I need a big sign on my back or above me saying, DO NOT DISTURB I AM THINKING.

        "content": "MakingCounty Durham, Dementia friendlyMany people like myself, who have one or other form ofdementia, would like to see the whole of County Durham and other Countieschanging, so that the whole Country becomes a Dementia Friendly place to live. But to do that we need to change the way people treatthose with the illness and change attitudes, by re-educating everyone. Some parts of the UK have succeeded in doing this,including, Stockton in the North East which is now well on the way to doingthat, and they must be commended for doing something positive.Dementia like all Neurological illnesses is very hard tounderstand, and how many times have we seen stories of ill treatment, which arelike it or not are down to misunderstanding of common neurological illnesses. If these same people had been given the chance to explaintheir medical problems to someone with common sense and tact, we would not havethese horror stories in the daily press.We saw someone who had Parkinson\u2019s disease being arrestedby the police because they thought he was acting strangely. He had tried toexplain his problems, but the police refused to listen.But then when we look at it everyone who has Parkinson\u2019s orLewy Body Dementia, we nearly all act the same way, but that is down to thecondition and nothing else, and to say anything else beggars belief, becausethat comes down to a total lack of care and understanding.We sometimes have the misfortune to come out with thewrong words, when we are caught unawares, but it\u2019s the brain which is notworking properly, we are not doing this to cause trouble. However the aim of this object is to make life as easy aspossible for those who have dementia, and to achieve this we must change theway people react to us, and change the culture.So we must educate everyone in the community about thisneurological illness dementia in particular, so that people who ever they areor where they are can understand what is going on and not jump toconclusions To make these communities dementia friendly we needeveryone on board, from the charities, to social services, councils, whetherlocal or county, local business, police, fire brigade etc.Each of these has a major place in making a communitydementia friendly, but they have to be fully committed to being involved, andnot just doing it to make it look as if they may get something from it.They will gain in the end as this project picks upmomentum, but they will all need to work at it. Some time ago I spoke to ourCounty Council about Dementia, and many councillors looked very interested, butnothing seems to have happened since.I think this is because they like many other groups thinkthat dementia is still age related, something we all know is very wrong now, aspeople as young as thirty are now being diagnosed with one form of dementia oranother. I have heard of large shops being interested, yet stilltoday many of these places are nightmares for people with dementia, and that isbecause of all the goods trolley\u2019s etc., left standing in the isles and in manycases the isles have been made even narrower by piles of others items which arethere to catch the eye of shoppers. If the isles arewide enough they are no problem, but most people with neurological illnessesneed to have space so they do not feel as if they are being boxed in.We problems with special awarenessMany would saythat if we are not happy we should not go shopping, but not all shops have thesame problems and to be honest, if everyone who had these illnesses stoppedshopping in these places we can guess who would have to move first, and I knowthat it won\u2019t be us but the owners.But to get this moving the owners of the shops, theCouncil, Police Ambulance and fire chiefs etc., need to have someone with theillness on board and ask their advice, and then take it on board, as we know whatit\u2019s like to live with this illness on a daily basis. Charities know about the illness, but not all fullyunderstand our problems. It also has to be taken on board that many people withdementia struggle when they are panicking and then come across someone inuniform, so the Police Fire Brigade and Ambulance services need to be aware ofthis.It would be lovely to have dementia friendly shops and caf\u00e9sand services in all towns, rather than the ones we have today where everyone isin a hurry, to either serve you or clear up before you have started.Many shop stafflive in a world of their own especially in supermarkets, and they don\u2019t seeminterested in the fact that you may be struggling to cope.Many people in the community who have this illness likeme would gladly go and talk to groups or businesses about our problems in thehope that we could help, and I have done this on many occasion privately, andnot through charities. This service is usually free of charge as we want tohelp, occasionally we may ask for travelling expenses, but on the whole that isvery cheap when you get first-hand knowledge of who to set things up which inthe end will benefit the whole community, as most families are touched by oneneurological illness or another.Many people who have dementia feel isolated, eitherbecause they have no family or friends, nearby, or in some cases their friendssimply disappear into the woodwork when someone gets this illness. I have even beenasked if this illness was contagious, something which too my by surprise at thetime, but it\u2019s a question which is quite common.If we can encourage schools to allow pupils to learnabout dementia, things will improve dramatically as it\u2019s the youngsters oftoday, who will remove the myths and stigma in dementia. These people will alsohelp shape the future as far as dementia is concerned. Many school children areseeing grandparents with the illness and want to find out more about it, so it\u2019sworth working with schools etc., as a starting point. There are around 800-00 people in the UK with some formof dementia, and around 16-000 of those are under the age of 65 which provesthe illness is not age related.We need to change things so that in the future people canlive at home for longer, as it\u2019s what many want, to be free and enjoying theirlives without other people saying what they will and won\u2019t do.Once a person is diagnosed and get medication they shouldbe encouraged to carry on working if they can, as it keeps their brains active,and as my consultant once said, you either use it or lose it. There are many activities and courses in the communityfor people with other illness, as well as carers for people with dementia, butthere are very few if any for those with dementia, simply because theorganisers don\u2019t understand the illness.Like many people I enjoy painting, but there are nocourses in Durham for this, although I said before there are plenty for ourcarers.One common fact that people with dementia struggle withis this, we all have problems judging the speed of traffic, and in Durham thereare no speed restrictions in town centres especially near schools and churches,something we are now seeing around the UK.It would help may if all town centres etc, had speed restrictions especially near shops church's and schools.So perhaps that is the next step to a better and saferdementia friendly environment Let us all work together and create a UK wide dementiafriendly community",

        "content": "As a person who could be classed as White British with dementia, I was truly amazed at a National Dementia Action Alliance meeting yesterday to learn if the problems with class and caste when it comes to Black and Ethnic people who have the same illness as myself.Although I had seem problems with stigma etc, in this country, I suppose I had not thought about the problems faced by those of the Black and Ethnic Minorities in the UK. But I am also lucky that my family have stuck with me all of the way.We heard many harrowing and sometimes tearful stories yesterday and I guess that it took my by total surprise, and was a little stunned to say the least, but that is down to a total lack of understanding, some may say ignorance,on my part and I guess that I am not alone in this.I had thought I had problems even after my diagnosis, but they were nothing compared to the problems we heard about yesterdaySo perhaps we need to start again and look at the problems arising and use those in the know to find positive ways of overcoming these problems.A lot of those we spoke about came into the UK from the 1950s onwards and brought their own set of ideas which I guess no one took any notice of. When we have dementia and talk of going home, we may well mean going back to the place of our birth, the village we grew up in, and for many people that is difficult to get straight in our brains.Yet in some sense this made a lot of sense to me without ever thinking about it at the time.Around 2004 we moved back to the North East of England after my diagnosis, and after losing my job through the illness.Shortly after coming back we went with a Cousin, to a Christmas service in the Village I was born in, and we really enjoyed it. It felt strange at first then I felt at home.However two of the people at the carol service actually lived in the house which had been owned by my family many years ago, and they asked my wife and I in, after hearing that I had actually lived there.It was amazing, but what struck me was the feeling that I had actually returned back home and I felt totally relieved, even though we did not live there anymore.To enter what had been my bedroom nearly brought tears to my eyes.It was a strange feeling and sometimes, when I go to visit an elderly aunt in the same village, I pass this house and it gives me a warm feeling.However I know now that the house belongs to someone else, but other people coming into the country many years ago may well have left villages or even land, so that when they return they can start again, something I had never even considered.In some sense I had left this village and then moved to a town, then after getting married we moved to the big city,London and then Oxford, both were a shock to the system as we were both treated as outsiders even though we lived in Oxford for 30 Years,So in some sense I can now start to understand the problems associated with these groups who moved to the UK, and how they must have felt. Many of us grew up in a society where you did not mix or speak to certain people in the community, for reasons that at the time were beyond me as a child, but looking back there were problems with class back in the 1950s in the UK, and although it means nothing to me now, it could well affect others as their dementia progresses. I can vaguely remember my father telling not to speak to certain people but did not understand why, however now I can see why.So we must now get to grips with this situation, and formulate ways of getting round the problems which could be vast in some places. I guess that by using the Alzheimer's Society etc, we will be able to find ways out of this problem even though it may well take years to set up and train peopleLet us hope thatnow things move a little bit faster for those in need",

        "content": "A few months ago, or so its seems I wrote about having problems with my eyesight, and how people think it is all connected to the Lewy Body Dementia.Having been put through a lot of tests over the last few months, I was beginning to wonder what was happening as I have periods of Double vision, which can be annoying when trying to watch television or read.After being through tests done by Dendron the Dementia and Neurological Research Unit, I was sent for more tests afterthey decided that more needed doing, as they thought it was interesting.Then the Eyeconsultant told me to blank one eye out with a handkerchief, behind my glasses. This is fine but it means everyone looks at you, perhaps thinking that my wife has given me a black eye, I say that in jest, as I gave her one during a very bad night when I was having one of my nightmares, caused again by this weird illness.But I opted to walk around or watch television with one eye shut, and I am getting used to doing it now when I see two of something. However that can cause upset when someone like the Grandchildren or my daughter come and give me a kiss, as I shut one eye as soon as someone gets within three feet of my face, otherwise I see tow of them. The sad think is that children don't understand what you are doing.This has now restricted my life as I don't now drive as much as I did, and have had to get used to using my left eye for photography.I am having to return to the Eye hospital again this week to have some more tests done, in the hope that they will say, that its just this illness and there is nothing more they can do. I then have a second appointment two weeks later to get the answers.I have seen some articles this week which confirm double vision etc, in Lewy Body Dementia so perhaps its another change in life, and one that may get worse in time, along with balance problems which seem to have started.Life is fun when you are healthy and you never appreciate your health until the bits fall off or stop working.Perhaps one day they may be able to do and perfect a brain transplant, and then like computers we can have a new memory fitted.",

What sort of clergyman goes to a care home etc to take a service and comes out with pathetic comments like this. Do they really not understand that many people with memory problems got into religion at an early age in life, and therefore, these things are built into their memories. To us its a ritual and a major part of our life, and not one we want changing just for the sake of doing it.They like the old hymns and forms of service without long winded sermons, yet these people cannot get this into their headsthat we like our services to be short and don't want to listen to the gospel according to this or that political party as many seem to do these days. As a person who once wrote to a bishop about Dementia, I was left staggered by his lack of understanding and care, let alone the fact that it totally ignored what I had said.Perhaps sooner rather than later these people will be trained to take on board, what is happening in society and do something about it.Lets be very honest many churches are kept going by older people who attend on a regular basis and ask for nothing but respect, something I fear many clergy don't understand these days.",

Is this due to things like the rise in teenage drinking, where many need hospital treatment.There has always been a problem with teenage drinking but now its getting out of hand, and this alone can bring the health service down if we are not careful.Years ago if you got drunk, you were put in a police cell overnight, and either given a warning or were charged with being a public nuisance, now they send them to hospital in an ambulance, which must cost the state quite a lot of money each weekend.Not only that but I do wonder whether this will increase the number with drink related dementia problems later on in life.Years ago you would have been embarrassed if you were drunk, but now its a badge of merit especially among the young and students, and many think it is funny when it happens. But if the government got hard on them and made them pay for the ambulance and the treatment, wouldn't it help, both now and in the future.Some years ago my dear wife was involved in a serious road accident through no fault of her own, and I remember opening the post two days later to find a bill for \u00a325 for the ambulance for taking her to hospital. That to me was quite a shock know full well that she could die before the bill was paid.Luckily for the family she survived and keeps me going now.While that accident was serious and I later understood that it cost quite a lot of money to use an ambulance, I now read the papers feeling very angry that people can get drunk and get first class treatment etc, when it is all self inflicted.Dementia patients on the other hand are not always treated with care and respect in hospitals, so just what is going on. Dementia as we know is not self inflicted, although I understand that one type is alcohol relatedIts not too long ago that the press were saying that the numbers of people being diagnosed were going to double, now they are implying that the illness is fading when many of us know full well that it is totally wrong.",

        "content": "This sounds interesting. I had heard about this a few years ago, and now its back in the news.Researchers at the University of Sunderland may have found a simple key  to solve the problem of dementia and memory loss and even reverse these  effects of aging.  They have shown that regular exposure to low-level infra-red light can  improve learning performance and trigger regeneration of the cognitive  function of the brain. The results are a scientific breakthrough as  current pharmaceutical treatments for diseases such as dementia and  Alzheimer's can only slow down brain deterioration.  The researchers claim that early stage dementia patients should see an  improvement in their cognitive function within four weeks, by wearing a  specially designed lightweight helmet for just ten minutes a day. Human  testing of the infra-red treatment on the brain is due to start this summer.  The new infra-red device was created by Dr Gordon Dougal, a director of  Virulite \u2014 a medical research company based in Newton Aycliffe, County  Durham \u2014 which is also behind the innovative device for curing cold-sores.Lead researcher at the University of Sunderland Dr Abdel  Ennaceur and Durham University\u2019s Dr Paul Chazot are pictured with Dr Gordon  Dougal and a prototype cognitive helmet   He came up with the idea of using a safe level of infra red light on the  human brain after it had proved effective in the treatment of cold sores \u2014 a  process that relies on boosting the cells within the body responsible for  killing the virus, rather than attacking it. The infra-red light used has a  wavelength of 1072nm, which occurs naturally in sunlight and, at the  intensity levels used, is considered completely safe.Dr Dougal said: \u201cThe  implications of this research at the University of Sunderland are enormous,  so much so that in the future, we could be able to affect and change the  rate at which our bodies age.\u201cAs we get older, cells stop repairing themselves and we age because our  cells lose the desire to regenerate and repair themselves. This ultimately  results in cell death and decline of the organ functions, for the brain  resulting in memory decay and deterioration in general intellectual  performance. \u201cBut what if there was a technology that told the cells to repair themselves  and that technology was something as simple as a specific wavelength of  light? Near infrared light penetrates human tissues relatively well, even  penetrating the human skull, just as sunlight passes through frosted glass.\u201dDr Dougal, who claims that ten minutes of exposure to the infrared light  daily would have the desired effect on the brain, added: \u201cCurrently all you  can do with dementia is to slow down the rate of decay. This new process  will not only stop that rate of decay but partially reverse it.\u201dThe research by University of Sunderland neuroscientist, Dr Abdel Ennaceur  has led Dr Dougal to arrange clinical trials with patients with age related  memory problems.Fellow neuroscientist Paul Chazot, who helped carry out the research, added:   \u201cThe treatment can indeed improve learning ability. The results are  completely new \u2014 this has never been looked at before. \u201cDr Dougal\u2019s treatment might have some potential in improving learning in a  human situation by delivering infra red through the thinnest parts of the  skull to get maximum access to the brain.\u201dFurther research work will continue in this area, funded by Cels, who  support healthcare research and development in universities, hospitals and  companies within the North East of England.

        "content": "I have just read this and thought what wonderful news it was. Over the last two years or so everyone had been saying that the number of people being diagnosed with dementia was increasing at an alarming rate.By Michelle Roberts Health editor, BBC News online Experts hope the downward trend will continue Older people's risk of getting dementia is going down in the UK, research suggests.A study in the Lancet reveals a smaller proportion of older people living in Britain now have the condition than experts had predicted. Researchers say it could be a reflection of improving public health. The work looks at three areas of England - Cambridgeshire, Nottingham and Newcastle - and compares dementia rates in people born 20 years apart.Based on 1991 trends, experts had predicted 8% of over-65s would have dementia in 2011. The actual figure for 2011 turned out to be just over 6%, the Cambridge University team discovered.\u201cStart QuoteThis could be because known risk factors for dementia are on the decline\u201dEnd Quote Co-researcher Prof Tony Arthur from the University of East Anglia Applied to the whole UK, it would mean there are 214,000 fewer cases of dementia than predicted - a 24% reduction.This suggests there are 670,000 people living in the UK with dementia, rather than the 800,000 - 900,000 figure that experts currently cite.Managing disease Prof Carol Brayne and colleagues who carried out the analysis say the UK is still seeing more cases of dementia year on year as a whole because of the nation's ageing population. More people are living to increasingly old ages, at which they are expected to be at the highest risk of dementia. But for the individual, the study findings appear to be good news. Co-researcher Prof Tony Arthur, from the University of East Anglia, said: \"When you compared the two cohorts born 20 years apart you see that dementia prevalence has gone down. \"This could be because known risk factors for dementia are on the decline.\"He said there had been improvements in managing cardiovascular disease, which has been linked to an increased risk of dementia. \"More people are spending more time in education as well which might be protective,\" he added. Dr Eric Karran of Alzheimer's Research UK said the study was robust and made reliable comparisons by looking at two groups of over-65s from the same geographical regions and using the same assessment and analysis tools, 20 years apart.\"One interpretation of the findings is that general health and health management has improved to the extent that it has helped reduce dementia risk, which is encouraging news for us all,\" he said. \"However, this study clearly demonstrates that the risk of dementia can change with time, and for future birth cohorts it will be important to track, for example, the effects of the increase in obesity in the general population.\" The Alzheimer's Society agreed, saying: \"While this is good news, this is one study which needs careful examination and may not indicate a continuing trend. \"For example, we also know that other risk factors such as obesity are in fact increasing.\"Dementia remains the biggest health and social care challenge facing the UK. Today's research doesn't mean we can take our eye off the ball. With no cure, few effective treatments and an economic impact dwarfing that of cancer and heart disease, more research is needed to identify the causes of dementia and how to reduce people's risk.\"The results are part of the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Study of more than 15,000 older people.",

However in the early to mid-stages, I feel that it isimportant to try to get on with life and if possible start a new life.My consultant told me to keep looking forward and to forgetthe things that were becoming hard to cope with.Through this I have moved on, but many cannot do this asthey struggle to come to terms with the illness, through either denial or thestigma which we see attached to this illness, or in some cases the illness wassimply too late in being diagnosed.I am contacted daily by email either from this blog orthrough other means about my problems, some of which have been discussed in theblog, and where possible I try to answer them. But in my answer there is always one comment, and that is weare all different with vastly different symptoms and problems, even in onevariation of the illness. We are all individuals, and go through the illnessour own individual way. It\u2019s very importantto keep as active as you can, either with hobbies or finding something new todo, even though it may be hard to get going, because the benefits are massive. The thought of sitting down and doing nothing never ever,got into my thoughts, as that would have been the end, just like giving in tothe illness. Yes I had a strong willed wife and Daughter who would notlet it happen, as they were even more determined to keep me active.I confess that I had not bargained for my daughter, when shesaid that she was not ready to let me go, to the illness and I was going to doas I was told? I love her dearly as I do my wife, and they keep me goingwhen times are hard. I have met a few people who do nothing at home and they allseem to be sliding away, from their families.To me, keeping active is one important way to keep theillness at bay, but I admit that not everyone can do this. I was encouraged to keep active, but I cannot swim these daysas I have lost my coordination and tend to swallow more water that enough. I don\u2019t go to the Gym because I cannot remember what I amsupposed to do, so I walk as much as I can each day. At least walking can be done in my own time and at my ownpace, and this encourages me to do as much as I can. I am also consideringgetting a small dog, which will be company when I am out and could also give memore confidence, so I know that I will carry on walking for as long as possible.Keeping the brain active can also help by doing things likecrossword and word search puzzles.I used to love Mahjong but that is limited these days dueto my eyes, which are giving me a hard time, as I have double vision art times.I no longer attend as many meetings like I used to do, but Istill try to enjoy myself as much as I can.But each time an obstacle comes my way I try to findsomething else to do as sitting still is something I find difficult ",

They made me take the decision of whether to go back as acleaner after being an engineer for over 28 years, or take early retirement onmedical grounds.I was advised to go for the second option as they likemyself felt insulted, by their answer.But when we look around many employers do exactly the samesimply because they don\u2019t understand the illness and are also totallyembarrassed that one of their staff have this type of illness.I know that I am not the only one this has happened to, butit does not help others, so things must change and change for the better. Yet other people in more high profile jobs had come out thesame way as me, from college lecturers to other jobs.Employers need to be made to understand what the illness isand what they can do about it in the early stages, such as support, and anyhelp available.If they don\u2019t understand the problems they are up againstthey should go out and ask, those who have the knowledge, or they should lookit up themselves.I know that in all honesty I could not have carried on doingmy job, but I do think they could have looked at this in a more caring way thansimply come up with this type of answer. To say that they doctor was upset was an understatement, shewas nearly spitting blood with anger when she read the response from myemployer, and then was too embarrassed to tell me until she cooled down.Perhaps it was not professional of her to lose her cool,like that as she was a quiet spoken lady, but I think she shared my feelingsand where I hit my hurt she let it all go.To her the thought of me going back as a cleaner after allthose years was just not on, and I understood this when it was all explained.I think that the other problem was that my employers clearlywere not interested in finding out more information about the illness, perhapsbecause they were stuck in the past with their memories if any of dementia, andwere incapable of looking at the obviousI cannot remember much of my job, which is not a bad thing,so perhaps I took the right decision",

Dementia strategy project manager Beth Swanson browses the music choices on the interactive screen While many of the photographs date from the 1950s and earlier, the trust is keen to add more recent images and other material.Ms Warren said: \"I think the common misconception is that dementia only affects grandmas and granddads but it can affect young people as well. \"You do occasionally get someone who's in their 40s who still has their children at home.\"The software allows patients to build their own life story with personal photographs, favourite songs and the opportunity to sing along with karaoke. Ms Warren believes using the material - \"low-tech\" versions are available - can also help relatives of people with dementia.\"Family and friends will feel that they're hopeless and there's nothing they can do,\" she said. \"That can be really disempowering, but, if you can give them a tool that they can use with the patient, it benefits the relationship between them.\"",

However at an eventand was so annoyed by the lack of dignity and care that I decided to do more,and help out where I could. During this time I have spent time trying to raise awareness about thelack of Dignity and Respect, when treating people who have this illness in carehomes and General Practise.Over the last two or threeyears, I have spoken at events in NorthEast of England Universities, where people are trained to do Nursing and socialwork, as I feel that it is very important to get in at an early stage and tellpeople how they should be treating people with dementia. I also feel that by spelling out guidelines of howwe would like to be treated, we are starting to have aneffect, as mostpeople \u201crealise\u201d that we are not asking for the world, but simply for thingsthat most people take as normal.I think that many people shudder, when we tell themhow we want to be treated, as they then realise, that there is somethingfundamentally wrong with the training that many receive these days.A few years ago, I spoke at the Launch of the Living Well with Dementiaproject, which was held at Middlesbrough,and after talking about Dignity and Respect, a few people came up and asked ifthey could use my script in their training at hospitals.This was something that I had not expected, but I did not have tothink twice about it, as I felt that it was very important, to get in at anearly stage.It alsoproved that these professionals were admitting that they did not know it all,and were openly asking for my help as a person with dementiaTraining people to understand the needs of those with this illness isnot as easy as it looks, as there so many variations of dementia and we are allindividuals, so I offered to go to speak to anyone who is training studentsetc, so that they will get a better understanding of what is needed, and how totreat people with dementia with the dignity and respect and care, THE SAMERESPECT THATTHEY WOULD EXPECT FROM OTHER PEOPLE .It was pointed out at one event, those with the illness are in a betterposition than GPs or consultants, totell others how we should be treated, because we are going through it on adaily basis. There are many roles that a person with Dementia can do if given thesupport and help, and being a Dignity Champion is one of those, and I do feelthat I am helping many people to understand the needs of those with thisillness. There are many more people out there like me, so why not allow us tohelp you, and also help ourselves.One ofthe main problems we hear about these days comes from the fact that many peoplethink that because they know or have looked someone with dementia, that theyunderstand everything thing about it and know all about its problems.But thisis far from the truth and there are well over 120 variations of this illness, andin each case, the people with the illness have different symptoms and strugglein different ways to others.Even twopeople with the same form of dementia, can have vastly different symptoms andproblems. This causes confusion to many people, but as we now know there isnothing straight forward about this illness.Treat uswith the dignity and respect that you would expect from othersByeducating and training people to understand the problems people with dementiastruggle with on a daily basis, we will then start to see people with dementiabeing treated with the care and dignity, that you would want from others.Pleasedon\u2019t patronize us by asking a questionand then trying to answer it. Give us the chance to think of the answer, as inmany cases we need time to process the information before giving you theanswer. That answer is better coming from us.Look usin the eyes when asking these questions as we are human beings like you, apartfrom the problem with our brain. I hate itwhen someone asks my wife how I am, when I am stood next to her, just how rudecan you get. I am not a ghost or invisible, I am here and right in front ofyou.Look atthe person and not the dementia.Rememberthat many get flustered because unlike you, they simply cannot come straightout with the answer, and if things go wrong we sometimes come out with thewrong words, and that leads to accusations of aggressive behaviour and beingrude. I haveheard this on many occasions, which makes me think that the accusers really donot have a clue about the basics of this illness.Treat theperson as you would have done before the dementia, we may have an illness, butin many ways we are the same as you, we are all human.Try tospeak clearly, carefully, slowly, and where possible face to face, so that westand a chance of understanding what you are trying to say. Pleasedon\u2019t assume that you know all the answers about dementia and what it is liketo live with it, but ask us, the people living with Dementia, and we will tellyou what our problems are, or at least try to explain them to you.Rememberthat people with strong accents, asking questions can be difficult tounderstand when you have this illness. As someone who grew up in the North EastI now struggle with the accent these days, so if it is difficult for me, thinkwhat it is like for others.Try tospeak in a calm voice and not get agitated otherwise it makes those with theillness react in the same way. Donot discuss our problems with anyone else while we are there, as that ishurtful and disrespectful, we have ears and a tongue, and so we can answer backourselves. We alldevelop routines that help us to get through each day, so please don't stop usdoing this.Some of us struggle with horrendous and quitevivid nightmares and dreams, leaving us very tired and perhaps agitated thenext day. When this happens, we sometimes need a short nap during the day tocatch up.So pleasedon\u2019t tell us that we should not try to sleep during the day, when we could notsleep at night because of these nightmares. People who say that we should not sleep during theday simply donot understand our problems.",

        "content": "I have just read an article about the mind or brain playing tricks with us when we have dementia, and there are times when I confess that I really hate the illness.I have problems with horrific and very vivid dreams and nightmares at nights, and sometimes end up getting out of bed, and then I sit in either a room downstairs, or in the bathroom till I think its safe to go back to bed. The problem then starts, what is still the dream and what is reality as I can not always work it out, as one seems to merge into the other.I have seen things which I know are not there are times after these bad dreams and nightmares, and it gets to the stage at times when I just want it all to end, as these horrors of the nightas theyseem to go on for ever and there is no getting away from them.I know that we all have nightmares and bad dreams, but these things have now taken on a roll of their own. Most people have a bad dream and then its gone, where these ones I have are so vivid that I can sit down and explain them out in detail the following day. Yet the bare no resemblance to reality.There are other times when I feel as if I am being got at by my wife and others, then later on, after either having it all explained in detail, or after I have satdown and thought it through, I realised that my brain had not taken on board what was being said in the first place. Its horrible when you think everyone is getting at you, and it ends up being your brain which has not worked it out properly.I sometimes read e-mails etc, and get the wrong answer? so after reading them 3-4 times and getting a different answer each time, I ask my wife to read it and explain it to me .This is distressing when I think I used to write reports, budgets and estimatesat work, yet my brain is now a moth eaten wreck.Writing things can also be a headache these days as I tend to miss words out, and its down to the fact that my brain is trying to work faster than my hands these days. Its only when I go back to check what I have written and then I realise words are totally missingI sometimes repeat telephone numbers, or prices in shops, and its amazing how many times I get the numbers all mixed up and in the wrong order.When I go to meetings I have to think carefully about what has been said, otherwise I come out with the wrong answer, simply because I did not understand what was being explained?Sometimes I panic when being asked a question and the wrong words come out.Modernbuildings can be a complete nightmare to many with this illness and signagedoes not help, as its either too modern or there is simply too much of it totake it all on board One of mymain concernsis reading a toilet sign when I am on my own and this can bedistressing on the days when I am not feeling very good.The onlyway I can get my head round this is to tell myself that a man has two legs,where the ladies toilet sign has a person with what looks like one legand a skirt. Sayingthat I would be in serious trouble if I was Scottish because as we know theythemselves wear kilts Havingsaid that we went to a building a few weeks ago and found that both ladies andgents toilets had very modern signs, both of which had pictures both of whichhad one leg, one appeared to have a dress, the other I was not sure, but weguessed it may be the gents. As wellas that many hotel call their rooms by different names, so you have to starttrying to understand what the name means there before going any further.I oftenthink that hotels could be more dementia friendly if each floor was a differentcolour so even if you forgot the number, you could find the right floor bylooking at the colour, but perhaps that will never happen.When Iwas working as an engineer I understood that all signs were to be standardised,but this did not happen, and it\u2019s seems that many modern hotels do things tosuit themselves. I have been in somewhich have two toilet signs on each door which is even more confusing.As far asroad signs are concerned my problem is that each time I look at a sign I readsomething totally different, but I think that's the illness playing its usualtricks. But it can cause confusion whenmy wife is driving and I try to read a sign.One thingI really hate is going into a hotel and finding it has a full length mirror onthe wall, especially if the room stays fairly light at night, as you sometimesget up and see the reflexion of a door in the mirror and sometimes make themistake of trying to walk into it.Othershave very large mirrors in the bathroom so you see two of everything, and inone particular hotel it had a large vanity mirror on the wall behind the taps,and it was the following morning that I realised that I could see myself sat onthe toilet which gave me quite a stir as I had not realised that it was theretill I was sat minding my own business. This isone of the major problems many like myself have, as we don\u2019t always see theobvious, until it\u2019s too late.Many people struggle with modernbuildings, and I find them to be a nightmare at times especially if they havemarble floors, as I sometimes see things which are not there.It\u2019s all due to the design, butsome people think that we have a form of 3d vision, which allows the brain tothink items are lurking in the design such as large worms, snakes or that we think there is a crevasse in the floorwhen there is a different streak running across it.Along with that escalators andrevolving doors are things that are a no go around because it becomes anightmare trying to judge the right time to move through themWhen I am doing a project at home I try to work it all out first, as I know that I am not as fast as I used to be as an Engineer. Yet its amazing just how wrong things can go.I am not frightened of dying, simply because I know one day it will come. But I confess to being terrified of this illness when it starts to get worse. Is this illness real or just another very long and nasty nightmare which I will hopefully wake up from.Does this brain of mine have its own sense of humour, or doing what it wants irrespective of my, I don't know but Ilaugh it off sometimes and others I just want to cry",

        "content": "I often wonder how carers cope with their unexpected role of being a full time carer for someone with dementia or any neurological illness.Those of us who are married all went throughthe marriage vows etc, in sickness and in health, but nothing prepares you for what is to come like dementia.Its a job they are untrained to do, as everyone goes down this route with different experiences, vastly different symptoms and problems. We are all totally different and no two people with any form of dementia are the same.I personally don't think anyone could train you how to do the job, as its all down to the individual and their symptoms and problems, and no one size fits all.Its a bit like trying to train a nurse or social worker to look after someone with the illness, where do you start, there is so much to take on board, then you need to change it all with the next patientwho is totally different.I often talk to trainee nurses etc about my Lewy Body Dementia, but as with all dementia's no two people with Lewy Body dementia are the same. Caring isa job which is theirs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year without a break.In the early stages life can as we know it go on as normal, but then there are times when we need that extra bit of support and help, but don't need it all of the time. I say this because we all need occasional support with things in the early stage but don't necessarily want someone there all of the time, because we want our own freedom and that is very important.Being able to call on someone when we need it, and being allowed to do our own thing as and when we want providingof course that we are safe to do so.It must be difficult for any carer to decide when we are safe to do something ourselves, and when we need to be watched for safety.Like many people with the illness, I can be suborn and feel that I can do things on my own, and in many cases it will be fine, but then there are times when the wheels come off, and the unexpected happens. Is it then the carers fault, or is it my own because of my pride.I do think its all trial and error, because its only by trying things that we understand whenits time to let go and stop being so independent. Its through trial and error that I have been able to let go of some of my hobbies and pastimes, because as my consultant said early on. If I cannot do something I enjoy one day, leave it and try on another day, if that fails try again. If on the third time it still fails, leave well alone as life is too short to get stressed trying to do the impossible.Through this I have learnt to let go myself, but my wife also knows when I am not up to doing certain things and supports me when I feel upset at not being able to do something, that I have done well for years. There are times when she may suggest that I let go, if she thinks it is becoming too much, but on the whole its down to me, as I am always thinking of my own safety, although that does not always work. Even though as an Engineer I spent time doing Health and Safety and Risk Assessments, I can still now get it wrongIts a difficult balancing act for the carer, as they don't want to be too protective, otherwise we may stop doing things and then give up fighting the illness too early.These people have a lot to put up with and they should get more respect and support from the Governments, as they save the public purse millions of pounds each year. Yet in reality they get very little support at all as no one really cares about them apart from charities which can give support and guidance when needed sometimes desperately.To me all carers are angels and I admire their courage and determination",

Yes they may have a basic understanding of this illness, but as we are all vastly different and there are so many variations where do you start. Another problem is that many care staff etc are under trained in dementia, if they are trained at all, so how are they going to do these testsTo say we are all the same and react in the same way would be an insult to us all.In this day of the sue culture where a lot of the public do stupid things, and then sue someone elsesimply because they are too lazy to look what they are doing, and think it is fine to sue others because they are too stupid to look first. With this in mind you have to look at this subject, and put it into context.Unlike the rest we are not stupid, we just happen to be inflicted with dementia, which stops us thinking clearly.Yes we make mistakes but these mistakes are on the whole genuine and unplanned.I don't want to sit back and give in the this illness, but intend fighting it as much as I can.",

Under the plans, more nurses will have part of their training in the community and the NHS will have enough midwives and maternity staff for all expectant mothers to receive personalised one-to-one care. Health minister Dan Poulter said: \"The staff working in our NHS are our health service's most precious resource, and we must do all we can to ensure that our staff have the right values, training, and skills to deliver the very highest quality of care for patients.\"Today's mandate to Health Education England, backed by a \u00a35 billion budget, will help our many dedicated frontline staff to further improve their ability to care for patients as well as enabling our NHS to train the next generation of doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants. \"As people are living longer with more complex medical and care needs, so must we ensure that our NHS workforce has the right skills and values to provide more care in the community for older patients as well as to give each and every child the very best start in life. Plans for the future training and recruitment of our NHS will lead to better working lives for staff and better care for patients.\" In a joint foreword to the document, Dr Poulter and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: \"The terrible events at Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust and the Francis Report reinforces the need to recruit NHS and public health staff with the right values and the need to put the delivery of high quality compassionate care at the heart of our NHS.\" Under the targets set for HEE, 100,000 staff will have foundation level dementia training by March 2014, 50% of medical students will go on to become GPs and at least half of all student nurses will do a community placement as part of their training by March 2015. A new five-year plan to ensure the right levels of staffing and training across the health service workforce will be in place by autumn 2013 including a commitment to tackle shortages in doctors working in emergency medicine. A&E departments have struggled to cope with soaring demand, with experts warning that emergency care systems could collapse in six months as a result. The mandate includes a plan to support the progression of healthcare assistants into nursing by autumn 2014, and to establish minimum training standards for healthcare assistants by spring 2014. HEE's chief executive Prof Ian Cumming said: \"Our mandate from the Government sets out clearly the plans for education and training that will be the cornerstone for the delivery of high quality, effective, compassionate care, by recruiting for values and training for skills. Our \u00a35 billion budget will allow us to recruit, train and develop a workforce that will deliver improved care to patients.\" Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said: \"These commitments are very welcome. On paper this looks good but it has got to be put into action and the Government have to ensure this happens. \"I want to look back at the end of the timescales the Government have laid out and see that all of this actually happened, and I look forward to working with them and HEE to make it a reality.\" Dean Royles, chief executive of NHS Employers, said: \"This mandate isn't just about having the right numbers of staff. In the aftermath of the Mid Staffordshire Inquiry, the NHS Employers organisation will work with HEE to ensure a strong emphasis on recruiting for positive values. \"We look forward to working with HEE on implementing this mandate and ensuring it delivers for patients.\" ",

If I have upset anyone I apologise but that was not my intent, I trying to raise the profile of this illness.This is something we all have to work together in doing as its very important that the illness gets a higher profile and better servicesI hope that will end this topic as I am here to help myself and others with the illness, not get into a press argument online.",

It will be open to the public and will feature a presentation by North-East-based neurological researchers.People worried about their memory or concerned about loved ones or friends are invited to pop in to the charity\u2019s South Shields office, in the Edinburgh Buildings, in Station Approach, for a private chat with a dementia support worker or memory protection nurse on Thursday from 11am to 2pm.On Friday, the Alzheimer\u2019s Society team will be manning a stall at South Shields market, and staff will be available to talk about the charity\u2019s services and dementia-related issues on an informal basis. Liz Williams, a South Shields-based Alzheimer\u2019s Society dementia support worker, is urging residents to take the opportunity to get to know more about dementia and the services the charity offers.She said: \u201cThe Alzheimer\u2019s Society wants to bring dementia out of the shadows, get people talking about it and help local communities feel better prepared to face it.\u201cAs the population ages, we all face the risk of one day developing dementia. The more we know about the condition, the more prepared we\u2019ll be to face it. \u201cThese events are a great opportunity find out more.\u201cIt is important that if people are concerned about their memory that they speak to us because we will be able to signpost them in the right direction. \u201cWe will be holding an open session at the office and also having a market stall because we know it\u2019s important to talk.\u201d",

Care for dementia sufferers could be transformed if nurses were given the time to care for patients    Jeni Bell, the UK\u2019s first hospital-based Admiral nurse \u2013 specialising in dementia \u2013 said care for sufferers could be transformed if nurses were given the time to look after patients, rather than be restricted to just dealing with their clinical needs.Ms Bell, based at Southampton General Hospital, said: \u201cPeople with dementia don\u2019t go into hospital because they have dementia, they are there because they are physically unwell but acute hospital staff have been ill-equipped to deal with the added needs that dementia presents.\u201dDementia UK has been awarded \u00a31.4million from the Health LotteryIf patients are confined to bays, they will wander off and touch things that might be dangerous, but if you give them a table and encourage patients to join each other for a biscuit and a chat, they will relax        Jeni Bell, the UK\u2019s first hospital-based Admiral nurseSpeaking ahead of Dementia Awareness Week, which starts tomorrow, she added: \u201cIf patients are confined to bays, they will wander off and touch things that might be dangerous, but if you give them a table and encourage patients to join each other for a biscuit and a chat, they will relax.\u201dThe charity Dementia UK, which runs the Admiral nursing scheme, has been awarded \u00a31.4million from the Health Lottery to fund a number of Admiral nurses.Owned by Richard Desmond, chairman of Daily Express owner Northern & Shell, The Health Lottery has helped to raise \u00a334million to support good causes. It has paid out \u00a356million in cash prizes.It is so sad and makes me very angry when Iread news press like this, and it makes we wonder what has happened to out brilliant health service, has it all gone down the pan, through all of the unnecessary changes and regulations.We should be looking after these people, because over the years they have paid their way through life and in many cases have served this country in more than one way, so why should they betreated with lack of respect. Every day in the UK we hear that the NHS is over worked by those who abuse the system by getting drunk every weekend, or over eat, yet those with dementia have done nothing to get this horrible disease, yet they are treated worse than rubbish.I am beginning to think that the wrong people are in charge of the NHS and it really needs a good revamp starting from the basics. If you don't get the basics right the rest will be rubbish as well.",

        "content": "I have spent the last fourweeks trying to write this, as I was getting very angry at the way the press publish some stories about dementia.I had major problems using the computer and spelling words correctly, so I hope this worksI do feel that the Media need to be more responsible intheir reporting of dementia issues, so that they do not reinforce stereotypesand stigma, just to get an eye-catching headlineI do think that the media do have a lot to answer for asfar as dementia is concerned, and unless things change they will carry on,causing unnecessary distress to those with the illnessThe reason forsaying this is:-We see constant headlines telling us that someone hasfound a cure or a miracle treatment, but it\u2019s just leaving those with theillness to think that things are going to get better, when in reality it is notlikely to happen for years to come.We see stories offoods which stop the illness, but can that be true.We see one moment that the Mediterranean diet is good fordementia, and then the next moment it does not work? They use terms like ServiceUser and Sufferers in dementia,terms which many with the illness hate. At the end of the day who wants to beclassed as a user of any kind, it\u2019s so unfair to class a person with dementiaas a user, let alone a sufferer. I think that main concern about user these days, is thatmany drug addicts call themselves service users, and many of us feel insultedto be in the same class as them, as we have done nothing to get this illness,it\u2019s not self-inflicted Yes we have this illness but it\u2019s the complications whichcause us to suffer. I suppose we had the same with cancer in the 1960sThere are far toomany stories and stories with a negative slant in them. They still class this illness as age related, when infact we know that is wrong, as there are thousands of people well under the ageof 65 who have been diagnosed as having the illness. Many things like this helpkeep the stigma in dementia going as many, feel that the press don\u2019t understandthe illness.Assistive technology and trackingdevicesRecently wesaw a story covering assistive technology and people with dementia, but theydid not seem to go out to people with the illness, to ask whether they wouldwant to use it or not. However, itseems that they asked others to comment, but did these people have anyknowledge of the illness or not. There are many out in the big wide world whoare full of information about what people with dementia, should and should notdo, but I really wonder just how many have a basic idea about our lives.I understandthat a police force wanted to cut down on the high costs and time; they use uptrying to finding some with dementia, when they got lost or go missing. They saidthat they would do this by using a tracking device, something which many peoplewith the illness carry just for their own peace of mind and security, as wellas being able to carry on with their freedom for a bit longer without carers andfamily members tagging on. Then the otherday I heard a story about a pensioners pressure group saying, that it was wrongto use equipment as it was against our civil liberties, as it was something whichwas used on prisoners. So did theyknow what they were talking about, or had the assumed wrongly that it was thesame equipment i.e. \u201cTagging\u201d.It seems to me that the press shouldhave covered the story properly, so that everyone would have understoodproperly what was being stated in the first place. Tagging is an item used to see where peopleare, when they are on parole from prison and is worn around the ankle. A tracking device for people with dementia can be awatch or pendant, and has an emergency contact button on it if we get lost orneed support. Some can even make an emergency call, if they are confused or getlost. A big difference to tagging? If a personwith dementia is happy with it and can see the difference as well as the benefitswhy can\u2019t others use their brains and read the article properly, and allow usthat extra bit of freedom, without constantly telling us how to live our lives.At the end ofthe day a mobile phone can be tracked by satellite so what is the big storyhere. Many of uswho have dementia have publicly stated that we would gladly wear or carry adevice, if it would help others to find us faster, and in a more cost effectiveway, rather than costing the public purse thousands of pounds, and many manhours, if we get lost or confused. If thistechnology is introduced to the person with dementia when they are in the earlystages of the illness, it can help us to be more confident And enjoy ourfreedom while we can without our carers being worried about what we are doingor where we are. Screening people for dementia In another instance it was reported in thepress that Doctors and Researcher\u2019s, were against screening people early fordementia, yet they had not said that in the first place.I think thedoctors concerned were looking into whether it was going to be feasible to dothis when there was no miracle treatment available, to everyone who was goingto be diagnosed as having the illness. To be honest I have to agree with thisresearch because, if there is no way of stopping the illness i.e. a cure or agood way of stopping it in its tracks, then what is the point of having an earlydiagnosis. I suppose it lets people like myself,have the extra time to get their lives sorted out, and enjoy what time theyhave left.But in any case how would you screenpeople for dementia?What would be the age groups involvedand would there be a cut off age?As we understand it there are around 12main types of dementia and around 120 variations, so how could this be coveredproperly?Is it feasible to do this screeningand would it be cost effective?Ethical issues, when there are noknown cures available, and medication that is available does not work on everytype of dementia? Screening for cancer can be good asthere are treatments that work, but what happens to those of us with some formof dementia.So what are the answers?The pressseem to go out of their way to make life uncomfortable for all in dementia research,even though they are trying their level best to come up with some good treatmentsI supposewhat we need like it or not is a way of controlling what the press say. This willstop them having headlines talking abouta miracle cure for dementia, when in all reality the drug being talked about isstill being trialled on mice, and no one really knows if it will work or not.This type ofheadline is very bad for all those of us who live with this horrible illness,as it leads us to believe we may be cured, very soon.Some of thiscould be caused by pharmaceutical companies saying they have found a cure, butsurely it should not be in the press, until it has been proved to work onhumans rather than mice.Many peoplewith dementia would trial these medicines if it had a chance of working, I know thatby controlling the media we could end up with no good stories about dementia inthe press, so perhaps we more responsible reporting, which would be better forthose who live with the illness, and want nothing better than a cure.But I think alot of the damage is done by editors who are just out to grab a good headlineat our expense. The reporters in general do a very good job, but it\u2019s theeditors who rewrite the peace for better headlines, so it can get more readers,many are not interested in the facts, nor are they interested in people whohave this illness.

        "content": "This week we saw this article in the news press and it caused so much uproar that its unbelievable, as many comments are from elderly and some like myself who have dementia.Sussex Police have bought 15 GPS tags which they hope will save them money searching for pensioners who wander off or go missing.Chief Inspector Tanya Jones told the Daily Telegraph: \"The GPS will be very cost-effective to the police. It will reduce anxiety for the family and really reduce the police time spent on this issue.\"But Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention accused the police of \"trying to get care on the cheap\".\"I think they should withdraw it straight away,\" she said. \"Trying to equate somebody who has committed a criminal act with somebody who is suffering dementia is completely wrong.\"I doubt whether anyone in the Cabinet would want their parents dealt with in this way if they were suffering from dementia.\"It looks at the problem in the wrong way. If you've got people in the community who are so bad that they are wandering off at night and are not safe, they should be properly cared for, they shouldn't be tagged.\"It's a crude form of monitoring when the issue needs a much more detailed response than this. This is a back-of-an-envelope response.\"There are currently 800,000 people with dementia in the UK. A number of local authorities are already using similar devices to track sufferers, but this is believed to be the first time a police force has taken on such a scheme.Chief Inspector Tanya Jones, the district commander for Chichester, rejected criticism that the devices could lead to dementia sufferers being viewed as criminals.\"This isn't a tagging device that people use when they are released from prison. It's used with the consent of the family and the individuals concerned,\" she said.\"It's almost been blown out of proportion that we are trying to tag the 800,000 dementia sufferers in the country. We will only be using these in specific cases.\"It's about finding people quickly before something happens to them, and secondly it's about value for money for the police but that's secondary.\"I have always had problems when it comes top assistive technology, because its something which helps everyone in life so why should it be so bad for people who have this illness to use.I have been told on many occasions that the use of assistive technology is against our civil liberties, but as far as I am concerned I lost those when I was diagnosed with this horrible illness \"dementia\" and unless you have the illness you have no real idea wheat life with dementia is like. Assistive technology is a God send in all forms as it allowsus to carry on with our own way of life, without other people following us around to see what we are doing and where we are going.Everyone in society uses assistive technology from, Hearing aids and glasses, to things like mobile phones, computers etc, and so the list goes on. Yet how many know that they are tracked or can be tracked using a mobile phone? is that wrong?I think there are far too many do goodies in society today, who object without thinking about what they have read and thought about it clearly. Did theyask someone with the illness for their views, I guess not as they think we are unable to answer for ourselves a lot of the time, and this annoys me.Like many who have the illness we want to live our lives without causing unnecessary upset or distress, and that could also come into play when it comes to us getting lost, something which can happen at any time. I trialled the Buddy system for our county council and thought it was brilliant as it gave me that extra bit of confidence, and if needed my wife could have looked on the computer at home to see where I was, but is that so wrong.If it saves vast sums of money looking for someone then lets just get on with it, as long as it is explained at the early stages of the illness, so we know what it does, and its no something that looks like a gadget used by those just out of prison.But these days these gadgets for use with dementia patients are very user friendly, and cannot be seen by others,and bear no resemblance to other tracking devices used by the law courts.I enjoy walking every day when I can, and enjoy the freedom which comes with it, so please think carefully before you start to say something is wrong for us. Like many others, my wife gets worried if I am out a long time and she is unsure about where I am, but I always have a mobile phone with me. HoweverI would never object to using a tracking device, because I know that if anything goes wrong it will save a lot of time and possibly money finding me fast and before its too late.I also recognise that other peoples time, is just as important to them as my own freedom is important to me, so its a case of respect all round.

        "content": "I have often wondered what people get out of beinginvolved with Alzheimer\u2019s and Dementia Charities, as we all have vastlydifferent needs and requirements, depending on the type of dementia and thestage we are in.For a long time I was quite active with one charity andthen stepped back through problems, but at the same time my life was being runby charity work, and there was little time to step back, take it easy and thinkclearly. Coupled with this was the fact that my family life took aback seat, and that was becoming very hard. I really wanted to see more of the family andalso spend time with my hobbies, and this was not happening, I guess it becomestoo hard to say no.I know that dementia is a well-known illness, but it doesneed to be given more of a high profile these days, as many still associate itwith an age related illness. We all know that this is wrong, as there are many underthe age of 65 who have the illness, so it can strike at any time and any age.Many charities and those in government circles still talkabout people with the illness, who are 70 years of age and older, yet theyforget the thousands of people who were diagnosed under the age of 65, and insome cases well under 65.I do think that until this is corrected, we will nevermove on as many will carry on sayingit\u2019s just a normal age related illness There is still a lot of stigma attached to dementia\u2019s ofall kinds and this must be got rid of as soon as possible. I say that becauseas we all know Cancer had a lot of stigma attached to it in the 1960s, now it\u2019sgone from there, and we have it in dementia. There are many charities out in the world today somesmall and small quite large, but I do wonder whether they are really focused onthose with the illness, because to do so would mean having people with dementiaactively involved in all levels of the processes.I admit that not everyone wants to be involved withcharities, especially if it means doing a lot of travelling round the countryBut many still do it as it keeps their brains active, andit also means the any campaigns are focused on those with the illness. This isbecause these people really know what it\u2019s like to live with it, and whatproblems they face on a daily basis.But in this day and age I do think that charities have alot to offer, providing they indeed focus on those with the illness, andproduce literature which is easy for us all to read. I say this because many dementia documents are written byprofessionals with professionals in mind, and use wording that many of us haveforgotten about or simply do not understand, or its medical jargon.All of these charities are different, and I suppose itall depends on whether you wish to be involved with a small but local charityor a large national one, coupled with the fact that some local charities havequite a lot of local activities, which you can take part in. I do recommendthat those who can, should get involved in these charities, to do eithercampaigning, media or other work as it can be fulfilling. It is also gives us a worthwhile role in society. I enjoyed my time thoroughly and would do it all again ifasked, as I feel that its very important, not only to help others in thefuture, but by doing something like this you are also helping yourself bykeeping your brain active, and nothing can beat that. While I do think there is a lot of internal politics, inall businesses and charitiesThese days, we only have to learn to step back, and takethings easy.",

        "content": "Its been a very long week with many problems, and the weekend dragged a little as I was trying to write a talk about Dementia and spirituality.I had problems getting my head round it because of the title, then it gradually sank in what it all meant, so I am now getting on with the writing.Spiritualitymakes us think of many things, including religion and its a topic which seems to cause a lot of problems around places like the UK, where people are against anything religious, or it seems that way having read many articles, about this topic on the Internet. However religion is very personal and we must take care never to upset anyone.However I do think our spirituality is also about our way of life and what we believe in, as I was always brought up to have a strong belief in everything I did in life, whether at work, homeor in pastimes and hobbies. I was also brought up top have a strong Christianreligion, and it has stuck, but I would never dream of thrusting my ideas down someone else's throat. I think we all have vastly different ideas about what we want from life, including our quality of life either now or in the future, and to me this is also part of our spiritual life.This could also take in things like our life story, which will include, who we are, where we came from, our families and friends, as well as things like, our pets, likes and dislikes.I have changed quite a bit since my diagnosis, and have taken to liking things that would never be tolerated before such as curries and rock music, but why this has happened I really don't understand.My tastes in music were always on the conservative side I suppose, as while I liked pop music I also like classical something which raised a few eyebrows at home when I was a teenager. Inever liked rock music of any sort , but now I love Freddie Mercuryand Queen along with a few other rock bands. My tastes in foods changed to the statewhere if I get the chance of a curry I will jump at it, and the hotter the better, yet no one knows why this change has happened.My choice of food depends what is on offer but these days I have been known to try anything to see what its like, while my wife looks on. I know that there are things that I will not go near to, but eventually that may change.But spirituality takes on all of these things in dementia, and its all got to be looked at, so that those looking after us can tell what we like doing in life, including hobbies, such as art, dancing, walking and many other things.I am hoping this week in going to get better than the last, but as with all things in dementia, you just have to take it as it comes",

I was always brought up to switch the radio or television off if someone rang us up at home, but these days people don't care, it seems that there is no respect for others anymore.I know it is important to get on in business these days but I do wonder how much damage it does to the brainand the eyes.My eyes sometimes struggle I am using the computer, so I have to be selective when I use it, but I have noticed that my ear sometimes gets very warm when using my smart phone, and this makes me wonder what is going on, as I don't hold tight to my ear.Has technology gone too far these days when we cannot go anywhere without it.",

        "content": "As with most of these illness we all have major problems, in life after the diagnosis, but we have to adjust things to suite, or sit back and sink. As one well known Professor said, we either use it or loose it, and that has always stuck in my memory.Using a computer when you have dementia is like watching a computer which has a virus, seeing all the words come up in the wrong order and spelt totally wrong. In my own case the letters of the words are there but all in the wrong order, but this is due to the fact that after years of being right handed , I now find that my left hand is much faster then the right, so I end up sitting on one hand to type on the keyboard. So my using my computer these daysis not brilliant, as I have lost the ability to remember spellings,sometimes have problems using the keyboard, my eyesight is starting to play up now, but at least I am trying to get other people involved, and to help them realise that they may have a Neurologicalillness, but they can still get out and help themselves, and also help others by getting involved in projects with people like DeNDRoN.This inspired me to get more involved in finding answers for others.   Some time ago I got invited to join a Government backed group looking into Neurological diseases and research, as I thought it was the one way in which I, as a person with Lewy Body Dementia could help.My idea was that unless those with these illness do something tangible to help researcher\u2019s now, it may take a lot longer to find answers to any form of cure to things like dementia.I know that this illness cannot be cured at present, but we have to have hope for those being diagnosed in the future. I also know that there is little chance of a cure for me, but at least there is a chance of finding something for other people in times to come.   We all know that there are medications which can slow some variations of these illnesses down but nothing as we know it can stop it, or at least nothing is recognised as a treatment to stop it. While medications work for some people they do not work for all, which can be distressing for those with the illness and family members watching. Some illnesses have no treatment at all, to either slow it down and make life that little bit easier. But like everyone else who has an illnesslike this, we will try anything which will extend our lives for that little bit longer, and why not. I suppose we have one major problem with research into some of these illnesses, and that isthings like dementia are not what many call trendy diseases and therefore many companies will not get involved. As well as that trying to find a cure for dementia is not as easy as finding cures for other major illnesses and therefore it takes a lot of money to get the research off the ground.  Groups like DeNDRoN Dementia and Neurological Diseases Research Network are one group who invite patients to get involved at local and national level, and to get involved with projects looking into future research work. Some may think it all about being part of research, but its also beinginvolved with PPI groups, Patient Public Involvement, where we can look at future research projects, while at the same time meeting new friends and learning about our own illness as we progressThey can sometimes get a person into Clinical Trials for new drugs which are usually run in the regional centres around the UK. Although as I am on medication which was prescribed early on in my illness, I don't really wish to come off it to try something else, unless I know it will make life better. I have had the privilege to be involved with many meetings and conferences where I have spoken about life with dementia, and will hopefully continue to do so if I can help groups like DeNDRoN.But we must remember thatwe would not get anywhere in research without people like DeNDRoN.It is my own theory that if we don\u2019t get involved and try to help, how can we possibly expect others to perform miracles and come up with cures in the future. I have also donated my brain to the brain bank when I die, so that it may help research in the future.This is another brilliant cause and we should all embrace it.I would encourage anyone with an neurological illness who is genuinely interested in helping, to get in touch with DeNDRoN or some other organisation to see what is possible.

Ihave always tried to keep my brain active with brain training games, and theyseem to help, especially if I keep spending around 20 minutes each day doingthese games. OneProfessor in Lewy Body Dementia, once told me to either use it regularly or yougive up and lose it, and this had stuck, although there are days when I can'tbe bothered with anything, but then its usually the days when I cannot workthings out properly.Iwonder how many other people with cognitive problems can do games like Sudoku,or whether it\u2019s just someone in the science departments saying that it would begood for us. Iknow that I am not as good as I was at anything these days including using thecomputer, but I force myself to keep trying something even though it may takelonger than it used to do, perhaps I am bloody minded about it, but I amterrified of not being able to use the computer anymore, and I think thisdrives me on.Lifehas changed for me and I rely on voice activated software to write at times,but that also helps as I have days when even simply words cannot be spelt byme.

One such friend once said thatwe tend to forget the settings at times, but through digital photography its not too expensive when we make mistakes, and the results can be very interesting. This is because we sometimes take shots that no one else would bother with, and the results can be very interesting and remarkable.So it proves that art in all its forms should be looked at and used when trying to help people who have this illness. Sadly in the North East of England where I live there are very few places where these ideas can be seen in practice, unless you travel many miles and then that causes tiredness before you even start.However I am hopeful that in the near future many new art clubs will be set up for people with all disabilities including dementia I did go to one local art club for people with disabilities but the noise was so horrific that I just gave up. This was caused by people going just to talk rather than learn or do art projects, but as many people know noise is counter productive in a room where there are people with dementia. But I think this event was badly organised and run, so perhaps something else will come up soon.But I encourage groups to use art in all its forms to get people with dementia involved.",

It\u2019s time for all of us to play a part in helping people  with dementia live well with the condition.\u201dThe research also found that people with dementia said they  relied on relatives and friends for social contact but 21% said they  speak to friends or family on the telephone less than once a  month.Older People\u2019s Commissioner for Wales, Sarah Rochira, said: \u201cThe  figures published today by the Alzheimer\u2019s Society reflect what many  older people from across Wales, as well as their families and those  who care for and support them, have told me about the impact that  dementia can have on an individual\u2019s quality of life.\u201cMore must be done to ensure that people with dementia have  the right help and support, delivered on a timely basis, to remain active  and engaged in their communities, which can make such a positive  difference to people\u2019s lives.\u201cThere is already much good practice underway in Wales,  with a number of excellent schemes, such as volunteer befriending schemes,  that play a vital role in helping older people with dementia to  maintain their independence and maintain their quality of life.\u201cAs the number of people with dementia will increase in the  years ahead, this good practice must be rolled out more widely across  Wales, alongside other important initiatives like  dementia-friendly communities, to ensure that people with dementia can  have the best possible quality of life.\u201dAge Cymru spokesman Iwan Rhys Roberts said: \u201cWith one in three  over 65s set to develop some form of dementia over the next 20 years  these figures highlight potential areas for improvement in the care that  is provided for people who have dementia.\u201cAge Cymru has long called for a commitment to providing more  money for research into the causes of dementia so that this research  is proportional to the potential burden of the disease.\u201cTreatment services must provide a holistic approach and address  all the needs of individual patients and attention should also be given to  improving public awareness of the symptoms of dementia and reducing the  levels of stigma attached to the condition.\u201dA Welsh Government spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have worked in partnership with the  Alzheimer\u2019s Society to improve support for people with dementia and their  carers, and have focused recent investment on provision and support.\u201cThe development of dementia-friendly communities is a key aim of the  Dementia Vision for Wales, which was developed jointly with the Alzheimer\u2019s  Society and published in 2011.\u201cOur work on the development of dementia-friendly communities in Wales will  continue to emphasise the availability of information, support and advocacy  services, and training for those delivering care to ensure we better recognise  and respond to signs and symptoms of mental illness and dementia.\u201cThe Commissioner for Older People has established a new five year Ageing  Well in Wales Programme, which will support the Welsh Government Phase 3  Strategy for Older People.\u201cOne of the four areas that the Programme is initially looking at is creating  dementia-friendly and supportive communities \u2013 five sites in Wales have already  committed to action.\u201dI have just read this article and I find it to very so very true these days.

In my case it\u2019sthe thought that I may loose control over my dignity. I also dread the factthat I may well forget my family members. Since I was diagnosed at an early stage, it gave me time tosort myself out, so that there is not too much left for my wife and family todo when things go pear shaped. It also gave me time to look back at what I had achieved,and sort out any lose ends, which there always is when we think about it, but Iam starting to be more positive as life moves on.Although life goes on as normal many days, there are some days when we just can notsettle or indeed say we are happy about doing normal things, this is becausethe short term memory causes all sorts of problems.I am not as active as I used to be, and don\u2019t do as manypublic talks, but instead I am enjoying taking things easy and enjoying my lifeand family while it\u2019s still possible.

Alison Goulding reports. Photos by Andy Martin. BEAMISH is famous for celebrating bygone years, but some of its most treasured work concerns people in the here and now.For years, staff have been working with care homes and helping people with dementia enjoy some cheer and good fun. Now, ambitious plans to build a new 1950s town at the museum have been revealed which will feed into this work.A block of Aged Miners\u2019 Homes within the town will provide \u2018Homes for Memory\u2019 \u2013 a dedicated centre where people living with dementia can visit with their families and friends.Michelle Ball is outreach and access officer for Beamish and has worked there for four years. Her work includes sessions with older visitors and specialist workshops for people with dementia. She said: \u201cWe use our pit cottage to do the reminiscence sessions. \u201cFor two hours we can shut the door and everything we talk about or see on outreach visits is right there in its context. \u201cMany older people love to chat during the reminisce sessions \u2013 memories come to the forefront. It can be more challenging and take more thought for people with dementia, but you do notice a difference as the weeks go by.\u201dIt is thought that the addition of a 1950s town will tap into a new generation of memories.Michelle explained: \u201cThe pit cottage is great but already some groups have said they were born in the 40s so it\u2019s more like their nan\u2019s house than theirs. \u201cHaving a 1950s house will be more relevant for some groups. \u201cThere\u2019ll also be more opportunity as it\u2019ll be bigger and more accessible. \u201cOlder people often find it easier to connect to the times in their life when they were making big decisions, like getting married and having children, so this will hopefully help with that.\u201dThe museum has now launched an appeal for people of the North East to donate their unwanted 1950s treasures to make the new town into an authentic slice of history.The 1950s town will be built over the next 10 years but for now, Michelle will continue to use the pit cottage for her sessions.She said: \u201cOften the thing people love the most is the open fire and the range. You can do so many things in that cottage, like having a cup of tea with the best china. We also do a lot of singing. \u201cWe have a lovely volunteer who plays all the Tyneside songs and songs from the war. When the band hall is built we\u2019d like to carry it on and do some tea dances in there.\u201d One of the most important parts of Michelle\u2019s job is to keep researching and learning about dementia, so her work is as useful as possible.Last year she travelled to the open-air museum, Den Gamle By, in Denmark, to see its work with people who have dementia. Michelle said: \u201cThey have a 1950s flat over a shop that they use.\u201cIt was reassuring because they do things in a way very similar to us. \u201cEven though we didn\u2019t speak the language we could see the same kind of characters and conversations in the group. When people walk in they give them a small job to do straight away, like setting the table. \u201cWe\u2019ve found in the pit cottage that after we\u2019ve done some baking, some of the women like to wash up. When they\u2019re in that non-clinical environment they remember they\u2019re a mother of six and a good cook. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to do things they haven\u2019t done for ages.\u201dWorking with people who have dementia is not always straightforward, but Michelle says she thrives on that.She said: \u201cAt first I felt that if someone wasn\u2019t saying anything they weren\u2019t enjoying it, but I\u2019ve since learned that even increased eye movement can show a person is more engaged. \u201cSharing memories can be quite challenging for people with dementia. We don\u2019t ask questions because that\u2019s what they struggle with. Instead we encourage them to enjoy themselves and then sometimes memories do come to the forefront without putting any pressure on them to remember. \u201cSo we might do some baking with a Bero book, which is fun and sociable and something they may well have done before. \u201cThe focus is that they\u2019re happy and having a good time.\u201cWe\u2019re now starting to look at more activities for men as we\u2019ve had lots of comments that they hang back and don\u2019t get involved as much \u2013 perhaps because a lot of the things we do in the cottage are domestic. \u201cWe would like to have a look at using the potting sheds at the back of the cottage so everyone can leave with a sense of achievement. We thought we could do some gardening or make some bird boxes.\u201cNo session is the same and it\u2019s very informal. \u201cWe encourage people to take pictures and make scrap books too so their family can see them when they visit.\u201dBeamish has an advisory panel of staff and managers from care homes, The Alzheimer\u2019s Society, the NHS and other relevant groups.Michelle said: \u201cThey\u2019re really good to consult about the big things and the little things. Like the fact that it\u2019s better to use mugs because they\u2019re easier to hold. If we put together a new reminiscence box they\u2019ll test it out for us and give us honest feedback. Chris Colley, 53, volunteering officer for the Alzheimer\u2019s Society in Chester-le-Street, is part of the panel.She said: \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do is create a dementia-friendly community within Beamish. \u201cThe work they do is absolutely fantastic. Alzheimer\u2019s is a disease where you need to stimulate people\u2019s minds and memories and Beamish fits perfectly because it\u2019s full of memories. \u201cWe work with the museum every year for Dementia Awareness Week and each year that event has grown and developed. This year we are hoping to be right in the heart of the museum. \u201cThey\u2019ve got such a lovely approach with people and they\u2019re keen to learn from us as well. They want to know more and more about dementia and Michelle has visited our day centre with the reminiscence boxes.\u201dMichelle added: \u201cWe work closely with the NHS and Alzheimer\u2019s Society for Dementia Awareness week and for the past two years we\u2019ve had a big picnic events with local schools coming along to join in. There was games, singing and a skipping rope \u2013 it was really good fun.\u201dl The Great Donate has now started \u2013 if you would like to donate any 1950s homeware, take it to the Beamish Regional Resource Centre. Follow signs to Beamish Museum. At the mini roundabout in front of the main entrance turn left just before the large red metal steam hammer.

This is of course made much worse by the fact that the builders have only just started to rebuild the house next door, even though its been empty since the flood last June.Still the weekend is coming and although the builders will be here for months to come, our family are heading back South and home again in the morning.Next week I have an appointment at the doctors so they can decide what to do about my hearing as its getting worse, and the tinnitus at night is overbearing, so I hope they decide to do something now that its getting worse as its gone on long enough now.",

It also causes problems because using the wrong words throws a different slant on what I was trying to get across in the first place. I say that because finding the correct word is not as easy as it used to be, when I was working.I also have to use spell check quite a lot, which is good on the days when my spelling is good or not so bad, on other days, there is no way spell check stands a chance, as I can not always work out just how a word is spelt in my brain.I sometimes use voice activated software to write these things out, but if my voice is quieter or weaker than normal, it does not pick up what I am saying or just writes what it thinks I have said.Similar things happen at meetingsI confess that when I go to meetings I end up with similarproblems, because I have to try to understand what is being said before I can find the answer I want. This sometimes ends up with me thinking of an answer when the subject has changed, and this can be embarrassing to myself as well as others who don't understand my problems.I have met many people at meetings who can volley answers off as well as questions, where I need to think about it very slowly, which sometimes makes me wonder why I bother to go to these events when my thoughts are so much slower than others.I suppose it all comes down to how I am feeling on the day, as some days I feel fine and question my diagnosis, yet other times I know that there is something wrong with me. Whether this is the medication working I am not sure, but when some people can quote gospel and verse at events without looking at papers to revise their memories I start to ask what is going on in my brain.I suppose I should be grateful that I can still do my blog and do my own thing when I want, and perhaps Ii should forget meetings and just enjoy my past times instead.

As a community we need to tackle our own fears and find ways of supporting people with dementia in a positive way.\u201cWhether we are family, friends, neighbours, in a service role such as shop assistants, bank clerks, bus drivers, or in a caring role such as doctors and nurses, we all need to have an idea of what it might be like to be a person with dementia, so that we can respond appropriately with compassion and understanding.\u201dSpeakers at the meeting, which has been organised in conjunction with Bath Churches Together, will include the chief executive of local community health care provider Sirona, Janet Rowse, as well as representatives of the city charity Research Institute for the Care of the Older Person, and the Alzheimer\u2019s Society. There will also be short performance by Arabella Tresillian of the Therapeutic Media Company aimed at conveying the voices of people with dementia.Ms Challenor-Wood, whose own mother had vascular dementia for 16 years, will be involved in a series of community workshops in the Bath area in March.",

I wasbrought up to think that anything was possible, and you should never say thatyou can not do anything, because if you set your mind to it you can achievemany things.But my consultant told me to stop trying to do things thatwere slipping out of my grasp, because if you keep trying to do things that aregetting more and more difficult through the dementia, you will only get veryupset distressed or perhaps depressed and that would do nothing for me.So since that time I have agreed to carry on doing what Ican, and if things get difficult that I stop doing it, and try somethingdifferent.I spend time doing things like writing my life story, which canbe very interesting when I remember the right bits.

        "content": "Secondhand smoke linked to dementia18 January, 2013\u201cPassive smoking can dramatically increase the risk of developing severe dementia,\u201d is the Daily Mail\u2019s headline. The newspaper reports that a study has been the first to show a significant link between exposure to secondhand smoke and dementia.This news is based on a large Chinese study that looked at the \u201cmental state\u201d of over-60s and their lifetime exposure to secondhand smoke.Researchers used a computer program to see whether the participants had problems with memory, thinking and changes in personality that were consistent with \u201cmoderate or severe dementia syndromes\u201d. They then looked to see whether there was a link between secondhand smoke exposure and dementia symptoms and found that people reporting any secondhand smoke exposure had a 29% increased risk of a \u201csevere dementia syndrome\u201d compared with those with no exposure to smoke.The harms of passive smoking (such as increased risk of heart disease) are well-established and there could be a case to add dementia to the list in the future. However, this study cannot prove that this is the case, due to a number of limitations, including the uncertain reliability of both the dementia diagnoses and the recall of exposure to secondhand smoke.Also, while the researchers accounted for various potential confounders such as age and socio-economic factors, there is the possibility that other unmeasured factors are influencing the association. The results in this Chinese population may also not be applicable to people in the UK.A definite link between dementia as a whole (not a specific type such as Alzheimer\u2019s or vascular dementia) and passive smoking cannot be reliably concluded from this study. Further research is required on this topic.Where did the story come from?The study was carried out by researchers from the University of Liverpool, the University of Oxford, the University of Wolverhampton, King\u2019s College London and the University of Texas in the USA. The research was funded by the Alzheimer\u2019s Research Trust and BUPA Foundation, and an individual researcher received support from the University of Wolverhampton Strategic Research Development Fund.The study was published in the open access peer-reviewed medical journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine.Passive smoking is known to be bad for health in general, so the Mail can perhaps be forgiven for its sensationalist headlines. However, due to the numerous limitations of this study it does not prove that secondhand smoking directly, and dramatically, increases risk of severe dementia.What kind of research was this?This was a cohort study that assessed almost 6,000 older adults in China, examining their mental state to see if they had dementia and questioning their exposure to secondhand smoke during their lifetime.Secondhand or passive smoking has been associated with increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases.The researchers say that previous studies have also shown that smoking increases the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s and other types of dementia, leading to speculation that passive smoking may carry a similar risk. However, no studies have yet tried to see how the level of exposure to secondhand smoke (what researchers would call the dose) may be linked to risk of dementia, and this is what they aimed to investigate.There are several different types of dementia. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common, followed by vascular dementia. While vascular dementia is associated with cardiovascular disease (and therefore links to smoke exposure are quite plausible), the causes of Alzheimer\u2019s - aside from increased age and possible genetic links - remain largely unknown.What did the research involve?During 2007-9 the researchers chose one urban and one rural community from four different provinces in China and randomly selected roughly 500 individuals from each community.Eligible adults had to be at least 60 years old and have lived in the area for five years.Participants were interviewed at home using a general health and risk factors questionnaire and the Geriatric Mental State Examination (GMS). A computer program was used to identify the mental conditions affecting participants.GMS symptoms were grouped into 150 \u201csymptom components\u201d, which helped the researchers group people into different diagnostic groups:depressionschizophreniaobsessionphobiahypochondriageneral anxiety\u2018organic\u2019 disorders (organic generally means that there is a definite disease process going on in the brain which is responsible for symptoms - the most common type of organic brain disorder is dementia)The program gives a number representing the level of confidence that a certain person has a particular diagnosis (0-5). They defined a person with 1-2 confidence level organic disorder as having a \u201cmoderate dementia syndrome\u201d and levels 3-5 as \u201csevere dementia syndromes\u201d.They used a questionnaire to assess the participants\u2019 smoking history and secondhand smoke exposure. Current smokers were those who gave a positive answer to the question \u201cDo you smoke cigarettes now?\u201d and gave extra information about the duration of their habit and how many cigarettes they smoked each day. They also defined past smokers and those who had never smoked. All participants were also required to provide the answers \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d relating to secondhand smoke exposure.Respondents were asked about whether they experienced no, some or lots of secondhand exposure at home, in the workplace and in other places. All participants were asked how many years they were exposed to each of three sources of secondhand smoke.When looking at links between secondhand smoke and dementia syndromes researchers adjusted their analysis for various potential confounders, including:agesexsmoking statusurban or rural locationeducational leveloccupational classannual incomemarital statusreligioncurrent alcohol drinkingvisiting children or relatives - which would suggest a good level of social supporthypertensionstrokedepressive syndromesWhat were the basic results?The study included 5,921 participants, 36% of whom had been exposed to secondhand smoke at some time (31% of never smokers and 46% of ex- or current smokers). Those previously exposed to secondhand smoke tended to be younger, have previously smoked themselves, live in rural areas, be of lower education or occupational class and drink alcohol.Moderate dementia syndromes (level 1-2) affected 14.1% of those with no secondhand smoke exposure and 15.7% with exposure. Severe dementia syndromes (level 3-5) affected 8.9% of those with no secondhand smoke exposure and 13.6% of those with exposure.The researchers carried out numerous calculations according to location of exposure and duration of exposure. No significant associations were found for moderate dementia syndromes. For severe dementia syndromes they found that any secondhand smoke exposure increased the risk of severe dementia syndrome by 29% (relative risk 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.59).They found a general trend for a dose-dependent relationship, where increasing levels of exposure, ranging from 0-25 years to 100 or more years, increased the risk of severe dementia syndromes, though not all of these individual associations were significant.How did the researchers interpret the results?The researchers conclude that secondhand smoke exposure \u201cshould be considered an important risk factor for severe dementia syndromes\u201d, and that avoidance of secondhand smoke \u201cmay reduce the rates of severe dementia syndromes worldwide\u201d.ConclusionSecondhand or passive smoking is known to be detrimental to health and has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However, it is not yet certain whether it is linked to dementia.Though this large study finds a significant link between secondhand smoke exposure and severe dementia syndromes there are several important limitations to be aware of.Problems with measuring dementia diagnosesThe method for diagnosis of dementia used by this study was unusual. Though the researchers assessed each individual using a mental state examination, they went on to diagnose them using a computer program which assigned symptoms into different diagnostic groups or \u201csyndromes\u201d. They then attached a level of confidence that this syndrome was the correct diagnosis, from 0-5. Those who fell into the syndrome of \u201corganic disorders\u201d where classed as having dementia. An organic brain disorder usually means a condition where there is a definite disease process going on in the brain which is responsible for symptoms.While types of dementia are the most common and largest group of organic brain disorders, this group would normally be expected to include other conditions caused by brain disease, damage or dysfunction. Therefore, it is difficult to say how accurate it would be to categorise all people in this syndrome group as having dementia.Also, how well the 1-2 level confidence can directly apply to moderate dementia, and 3-5 applies to severe dementia, is difficult to say. Mental state examination and cognitive tests often pick up more minor degrees of memory loss and it is not reasonable to assume that all memory changes are dementia or will inevitably lead to it. The most effective way to diagnose organic disorders would be to carry out a thorough clinical assessment, including the use of brain scans, but this option may not have been available to the researchers.Overall, it is difficult to say whether the diagnoses of dementia made were entirely accurate.Reliability of smoke exposure reportingSimilarly there may be questionable reliability over the responses on exposure to secondhand smoke, particularly when participants were being asked to specify where they had been exposed and for how long.Unaccounted confounding factorsThough the researchers have adjusted their analyses for several potential confounders, it is still difficult to conclude for certain that smoke exposure is directly responsible for any link seen, and that other unmeasured factors are not involved.Population demographicsThe study has only assessed a Chinese population. It may be difficult to apply these results to people of different cultures and ethnicities who have different exposure to secondhand smoke, and who are affected by other factors that could influence the risk of dementia.The harms of passive smoking are well-established. However, whether there is a definite link between dementia as a whole (rather than a specific type of dementia) and passive smoking cannot be reliably concluded from this study.As the researchers point out, currently 93% of the world\u2019s population live in countries that do not have public smoking bans. Further research highlighting the potential dangers of passive smoking would be useful.",

Dick Wagner is best known as a close cohort of Alice Cooper (he co-wrote most of Cooper\u2019s biggest hits, including \u2018Welcome To My Nightmare\u2019) and has also played lead guitar for the likes of Aerosmith and Kiss.In 2007, however, his career hit the rocks when he suffered a stroke and a heart attack, Yahoo news reveals. \u201cI woke up from a coma after two weeks with a paralyzed left arm,\u201d says Wagner. Although he worked hard at rehabilitation, there was something stopping him making a full recovery. He suffered from a \u201cmental fuzziness\u201d as well as balance issues, which created further problems, when they caused him to fall and injure himself. In 2011, though, he was finally diagnosed with NPH (normal pressure hydrocephalus), a build up of spinal fluid in the brain\u2019s ventricles.NPH often mimics the symptoms of other illnesses, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases. Doctor\u2019s determined that it wasn\u2019t the stroke that had removed his ability to play guitar, but the NPH. Now, aged 70 and living in Arizona, the effects of NOH have been reversed, with the aid of a spinal tap, to drain fluid from the brain. Doctors placed a \u2018shunt\u2019 in his head to redirect the fluid, via a tube, under the skin to his abdominal cavity, removing a small amount of fluid every day for the rest of his life. Finally, Wagner has regained the ability to play guitar and do what he loves the most. \u201cI am like a new man almost overnight,\u201d said the rocker.I am amazed at this and found the article very interesting to read.

Currently, doctors can struggle to diagnose dementia, meaning the most appropriate treatment may be delayed. More invasive tests can help, but are unpleasant for the patient.\u201cStart QuoteThis could be used as a screening method and any borderline cases could follow up with the lumbar puncture or PET scan\u201dEnd Quote Lead researcher Dr Corey McMillan Distinguishing features Despite being two distinct diseases, Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia, share similar clinical features and symptoms and can be hard to tell apart without medical tests. Both cause the person to be confused and forgetful and can affect their personality, emotions and behaviour.Alzheimer's tends to attack the cerebral cortex - the layer of grey matter covering the brain - where as frontotemporal dementia, as the name suggests, tends to affect the temporal and frontal lobes of the brain, which can show up on brain scans, but these are not always diagnostic. A lumbar puncture - a needle in the spine - may also be used to check protein levels in the brain, which tend to be higher in Alzheimer's than with frontotemporal dementia.A team at the University of Pennsylvania set out to see if they could ultimately dispense of the lumbar puncture test altogether and instead predict brain protein levels using MRI brain scans alone.They recruited 185 patients who had already been diagnosed with either Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal dementia and had undergone a lumbar puncture test and MRI scanning. DementiaThere are many causes of dementia, with Alzheimer's the most commonMore than half a million people in the UK have Alzheimer's diseaseFrontotemporal dementia tends to affects people who are younger - under 65 - and can affect a personality and behaviourOther types of dementia include vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodiesThe researchers scrutinised the brain scans to see if they could find any patterns that tallied with the protein level results from the lumbar puncture tests. They found the density of gray matter on the MRI scans correlated with the protein results. The MRI prediction method was 75% accurate at identifying the correct diagnosis.Although this figure is some way off an ideal 100%, it could still be a useful screening tool, say the researchers. Lead researcher Dr Corey McMillan said: \"This could be used as a screening method and any borderline cases could follow up with the lumbar puncture or PET scan.\"Dr Simon Ridley, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"This small study suggests a potential new method for researchers to distinguish between two different types of dementia, and a next step will be to investigate its accuracy in much larger studies involving people without dementia. \"While this method is not currently intended for use in the doctor's surgery, it may prove to be a useful tool for scientists developing new treatments. The ability to accurately detect a disease is vital for recruiting the right people to clinical trials and for measuring how well a drug may be working. \"Ultimately, different causes of dementia will need different treatment approaches, so the ability to accurately distinguish these diseases from one another will be crucial.\"The only drug currently licensed in England and Wales for treating frontotemporal dementia is rivastigmine. There are four licensed treatments for Alzheimer's - donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine.",

Presenter and Alzheimer's Society ambassador Fiona Phillips, whose parents both had dementia, said that if her mother had been diagnosed earlier then she could have handled the situation better. She said: \"I remember one Christmas when my husband and I arrived at Mum and Dad's and found Mum distant and cold. \"There was no food in the house at all and she seemed to have forgotten we were coming. \"We didn't realise then that she was already suffering badly with Alzheimer's. \"It took another while before she received her diagnosis - if only we had gotten it sooner, I would have been able to plan things, instead of doing everything in a big rush. \"It could also have prevented things happening like my mum setting the kitchen on fire. \"When you have an early diagnosis there are things you can do.\" An Alzheimer's Society spokeswoman said that one in three people over 65 would develop dementia. Research by the charity shows that 800,000 people in the UK have a form of dementia, this figure is predicted to soar to one million within a decade. ",

Both the Scottish DementiaWorking Group and the Alzheimer's Society's Living with Dementia Working Groupshad a really positive role in raising awareness and campaigning in the past. However these days we are onlyleft with the Scottish Dementia Working Group, and the Living with DementiaGroup has disappeared completely, through what many think was purely politicalpurposes.The reason many people thinkwas because the Alzheimer's Society wanted full control over them, and manywithin the group thought it was wrong. It also cost a fair bit of money to run,but I do think that this part was not done properly at times, and this let toproblems. There were also concerns that people were told what they should and shouldnot say at times, something which took away our freedom to speak from the heartif it conflicted with the Societies viewsThe Scottish Group isindependent of the Scottish Alzheimer's Society, although it retains stronglinks. This group is funded separately and works well with the ScottishParliament, in campaigning and working on projects which need governmentsupport, and they are well respected around the world.I have many friends withinthe Scottish Group and have admired them for a long time as they really getthings done, to improve the lives of all with dementia. Like the Living withdementia working group they set out to inspire others with the illness to goout and help others while at the same time proving that you can enjoy life andlive well with dementia.As I was told at an earlystage, when I went to the first UK Convention for people with Dementia, thereis still a new life after the diagnosis, and with help and support you may wellfind it. Since that event I havelearnt so much and met so many new friends around the world, and life has takenon a new meaning.So why can we not have theWorking Group back in England. Well I suppose to do this properly it must befunded separately from the Alzheimer's Society and must be allowed to workindependently, but that will possibly mean being funded by a large company asthe public purse is running out.But providing that companydoes not have too much baggage attached to it, I see no reason why this shouldnot get support.We are at the end of the daytrying to get people inspired to campaign, and work for others, and if theAlzheimer's Society does not want this to happen then why not let someone elsedo it, providing it\u2019s well organised and run.This has to be done one wayor another and with the support of the Joseph Rowntree Trust we may well seesomething happen as this group is independent of the Society and they want tosee things change for those with the illnessHowever I do feel that theway forward is for charities, to encourage people with dementia to getinvolved, and feel wanted. Those with dementia know whatits like to live with the illness, as they have it, and other people should notassume that they know all about it. So by inspiring us to get up and helpothers we are also helping ourselves and all who follow us in the future.",

The money is being doled out by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR).Examples of projects covered by the grant include trialling the use of a blood pressure drug called Losartan to complement current treatments for Alzheimer\u2032s. This is in addition to the UK\u2032s first ever trial measuring how much longer people with dementia can live safely and independently in their own homes, if provided with a specialised telecare technology package including motion sensors, GPS trackers, and personal alarms.Another is a trial to produce a comprehensive toolkit for GPs to make identifying the signs of the disease easier and improve diagnosis rates.Welcoming the announcement, Alzheimer\u2032s Society Chief Executive Jeremy Hughes pointed out that, \u201cAs it stands, there are currently more clinical trials into hay fever than there are into some of the most common forms of dementia.\u201cDementia is the greatest health and social care challenge of our time and defeating it needs to be a priority for society,\u201d he added.Announcing the funding, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said, \u201cThe UK is home to some of the world\u2032s best dementia researchers and specialist research facilities, and this Government is committed to supporting them.\u201cTo make a real difference to research, Government must respond to the barriers the industry faces. It is vital that we can translate the excellent work happening in our laboratories across the country into treatments that can help people live well with dementia today, whilst ultimately working towards finding a cure.\u201dHunt made his remarks while visiting Eli Lilly\u2032s UK dementia research centre.Government figures suggest 670,000 people in England are currently diagnosed with the dementia, a figure it says is set to double in the next 30 years, creating \u201cone of the biggest challenges faced by the UK in recent times.\u201dThe news complements the publication last month of the Department\u2032s first Progress Report on the Prime Minister\u2032s Challenge on Dementia, which had been launched in March 2012. Some of the achievements highlighted in that Report included a \u00a350m fund to create specially adapted wards and care home spaces to improve the experience of people with dementia.\u00a9 so2say communications Ltd, All rights reserved.

However she put me on antibiotics which did not make any sense at all if there was no infection. When we left the surgery I asked my wife if she was happy seeing someone who really did not want to be there and she looked rather puzzled.Then I told her that the GP was doing online shopping while seeing her patients, and this shook her.I found this sort of thing to be rude and very arrogant, and also showed lack of respect to her patients. Yes GPs may be busy but so is everyone else, and to be honest when I worked I did over 50 hours a week, sometimes up to 80 as I was an engineer on call.Yet these doctors are doing less work than the average person and getting twice as much money for it.I hear that GPs are going to be running the health service in the future, and this I find staggering when this sort of thing goes on in surgeries, and lets be honest it can not be a one off.I did not have an infection as I still have the cough although its not as bad, but I have heard since that it could be to do with my asthma? not an infection, which may well be caused by the fact thatwe are in a flat with night storage heaters which seem to dry the air out. As well as that when we go to our house, the fumes are bad due to the paint, but they are due to finish today, and it would be nice to sit and do things even though we can not move back in till January.I confess that it worries me that these GPs are responsible for all patients including those with dementia who cannot fend for themselves. If I had gone to this doctors on a bad day I would never have noticed what they were doing on the computer, but I have to ask if others are doing the same thing as there are always large gaps between one patient leaving and the net going in.I am dreading these people taking over the health service as some only work two or three days a week and get very well paid for this service.",

        "content": "NHS to reward surgeries which provide an  all-round good serviceCritics say GPs should not receive extra  bonuses just for doing their jobs Health minister Dr Dan Poulter believes the new targets  will improve quality in careGPs will be paid thousands of pounds in  bonuses for hitting a new raft of NHS targets.Their practices will be given extra payments  worth up to \u00a330,000 a year if they make improvements in cancer, dementia and  out-of-hours care.The NHS wants to reward surgeries which  diagnose patients early, improve survival rates and provide an all-round good  service. The GPs running the surgery can decide whether to plough the bonuses  back into patient care, or pay themselves and their staff.But critics say GPs are already well paid and  should not receive extra bonuses just for doing their jobs. In the past six  years, their average salaries have soared by 50 per cent to \u00a3110,000 a year,  thanks to a controversial contract negotiated under Labour. It enabled them to stop working evenings and  weekends while earning extra cash for meeting targets which were widely  considered to be too lenient. Many family doctors now employ locums to  cover out-of-hours work and concerns have been raised about the standard of  care.Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said: \u2018It\u2019s  an outrage. GPs do not deserve any more money. They think health is a weekday,  nine-to-five business that stops at weekends. Yet our GPs are some of the  highest paid in the world.\u2019 And Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance,  said: The last thing taxpayers will want to see is bigger salaries and bonuses  for already well-paid GPs without significant improvements to services.\u2019 Details of this latest bonus scheme have been  unveiled by the NHS Commissioning Board, a recently formed quango tasked with  overseeing GPs.Family doctors are forming local  organisations known as Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) which will replace  Primary Care Trusts. From 2014, they will be measured on new  targets including the number of patients dying from cancer, heart disease and  lung conditions. They will also cover the proportion  of  patients diagnosed promptly with dementia and patient satisfaction  with the  surgery and out-of-hours care. The best-performing organisations \u2013 or those  which make substantial  improvements over the course of the year \u2013 will be given  bonuses, known  as \u2018quality premiums\u2019. Each surgery within the CCG will be given \u00a35  for every patient on its books. An average practice has 6,000 patients, equating  to a maximum payment  of \u00a330,000 a year. Early diagnosis and better survival rates are to be  rewarded as part of the new target schemeThe bonuses will be handed to the CCG, which  would then distribute it to the practices. Organisations who have gone over budget will  not get any bonus payments \u2013 regardless of how many targets have been met. The  first bonus payments will be made in 2014/15.Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said: \u2018Reviewing the contract will ensure doctors have the right training and rewards  from the moment they qualify to when they retire as an experienced  consultant.\u2019  Meanwhile, hospital doctors could see their  pay soar to up to \u00a3160,000 a year as part of government plans to improve  performance.Ministers want to create \u2018super-consultants\u2019 who would take on leadership responsibilities and become experts in their field. Such doctors, known as \u2018principal  consultants\u2019, would earn up to \u00a3120,000 a year with a bonus of up to \u00a340,000.The Government also wants to scrap the  controversial \u2018lifetime\u2019 bonuses scheme which sees doctors paid up to \u00a375,000 a  year on top of their six-figure salaries.Thousands receive the payments regardless of  whether they still do the extra work that first earned them the money. Ministers  want to make them reapply each year.Yesterday the NHS also announced plans to  make doctors work at weekends. But officials are unlikely to be able to force  GPs to see patients out-of-hours \u2013 they will be able to carry on subcontracting  the work to locums.",

The people we met there were very warm and friendly. One day we may go back again.Another place which sounds interesting is Russia, as wewere going on a Baltic cruise this summer until the floods in June put an endto that.Your imagination can run wild with this, but then realitykicks in and you realise that you will never get the chance and you come backto earth with a thump.

Its seems that some people never admit to having this illness whenplanning a holiday abroad as the are penalised with high insurance premiums.There are many companies who claim to specialise in travelinsurance for people with pre existing medical conditions, until you start tolook into this. All seems to go well until you mention the word dementia, andthen there is a dreadful silence. Usually followed by the words, sorry but Iwill have to ask my supervisor about this.I know of many people with medical conditions who like totravel and have a nice holiday, yet like me they are becoming members of thevast chain of people who are victimised by the travel insurance industry,because they have some form of illness. We are damned if we don\u2019t say that wehave an illness when applying for travel insurance, and damned if we do claimit when asked.Many like myself have early onset dementia, and yet likeeveryone else we are within our rights to enjoy our lives as much as possible,and if that includes having a holiday so be it. Like it or not it is everyone\u2019sright to have a holiday if they can afford it.It is my own personal view that if company say\u2019s that theywill insure someone with dementia, cancer or any other long term illness; theyshould really mean what they say.Of cause many companies will insure us for a vastly overrated fee, which in many cases costs more than the cost of the holiday, and wetend to get to the position where you really don\u2019t want to go anywhere and thatis very sad. I have been charged \u00a330 for a weekend in North Ireland and \u00a3110for 7 days in Malta simply because of my illness.All seems to go well until the word dementia is mentionedand then the questions get harder or sometimes sillier. Many companies simply do not under stand orknow what the illness is, and those that have heard think that there is onlyone form of this illness and that is senile dementia.I have Lewy Body dementia, which differs from other forms ofthe illness, but there again each dementia is different, and each personstruggles in different ways, yet we are all lumped together, and treated with atotal lack of dignity and respect. Some firms simply can not spell the worddementia, or they say they have never heard of it.When my wife has tried to explain what Lewy Body Dementiais, she is treated as if I am a Martian, but I have to ask why this happens, inthis day and age.I don\u2019t think anyone with dementia would travel longdistances on their own, they may in the very early stages, but not after that,as we could become confused and get lost. Most people who have the early stages of this illness andthose who care for them, are safety conscious and cut down the risks, but sadlythese insurance companies can not see this. It\u2019s not as if we are going to diesuddenly with this illness, and if we are travelling with a spouse I see noreason for hiked up prices. If we were so ill we would not be going anywhere. So why do so many companies claim that they will insure uswhen it is obviously untrue.We have trawled the Internet looking at companies who claimthey will cover me, then the premium goes higher and higher, or they say sorrybut we simply can not insure you.I have come to the conclusion that many companies claim thatthey will insure us, because it\u2019s a quick way to make money at someone else\u2019sexpense. This is a way of making money, which knowing full well that those ofus who are honest will pay up front, to ensure that we are covered.Yet there is now a growing band of people around the world,who will not confess to having this illness because they feel as if they arebeing victimised or stigmatised by travel insurance companies.I have seen many people while I have been on holiday, and Iam sure that a lot of these are travelling without the proper insure, simplybecause they can not afford it.I now think that it is time that companies specialising inholidays for the elderly etc, look at this and come up with a travel insurancethat is relevant and cost effective.One year a very high profile company did insure for a yearto travel around Europe, and then when it came to renew the policy, the pricehad more than doubled. When my wife asked why this had happened she was toldthat it was all down to the computer and not their fault? While some companies claim to insure people like myself,they do so at a vastly high premium rate, and do so because they simply do notunderstand that many people are cash strapped, to start with without needing topay vast sums of money in travel insurance.So please look into this and do something positive to helpthose, who have enough problems medically without the stress of trying to findcost effective insurance.Lets be very honest we are not likely to get involved withdangerous sports or activities, so please remember we are just as entitled to travel as anyone else, so if your company sells insurance for those with medical conditions, makes sure it is what it says it is, and really covers us for travel insurance.",

        "content": "A new hi tech early dementia assessment service that could slash the time it takes for doctors to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease from 18 months to three months is being developed, thanks to underpinning research at Imperial College London.The assessment service integrates several cognitive tests with computerised examinations of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. It could provide medics with a way of detecting dementia much earlier than is currently possible using conventional technology. At the heart of the assessment service\u2019s software is an algorithm created by Dr Robin Wolz and Professor Daniel Rueckert from the Biomedical Image Analysis Group in the Department of Computing at Imperial.The new system could slash the time it takes for doctors to diagnose Alzheimer?s disease from 18 months to three monthsThe researchers say the 15 months of diagnosis time the new system could save are critical to the effectiveness of treating diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s. This is due to the fact that existing drug treatments are most effective in these diseases\u2019 earliest stages.Dr Wolz, who received his Ph.D. from Imperial College London in medical image analysis, says:\u201cThe size of the parts of the brain important for memory such as the hippocampus and amygdala steadily decrease as Alzheimer\u2019s progresses. Doctors use this as an indicator of how far Alzheimer\u2019s has progressed in patients. Currently, doctors have to work out what is happening to the structure of the hippocampus using an MR scan. This is a painstaking, costly and time-consuming process, where doctors have to analyse the three-dimensional scan slice by slice, so is only ever done in highly specialized centres. Our automated technology can provide this information to all doctors, seamlessly integrated into current processes, and by adding information and increasing confidence, speed up the diagnosis process. This could lead to quicker treatments for patients to improve their quality of life.\u201dDr Wolz\u2019s method, Learning Embeddings for Atlas Propagation (LEAP), removes the need for a doctor to map out the brain structure by hand. LEAP can examine MRI brain scans and measure the volume of specific brain structures like the hippocampus and amygdala rapidly and accurately.As part of the project, GPs will start testing the memory of patients who potentially have dementia using the memory-testing software. Patients who test abnormally will take a second cognitive test and receive an MRI brain scan. The scans will run through a computer program that uses Dr Wolz\u2019s method to assess signs of brain shrinkage. The results from these two tests will be combined with an assessment of blood vessel damage in the brain and given to the GP who will decide on further treatment.This project is a collaboration between Cambridge Cognition, a creator of cognitive tests, and the medical imaging company IXICO Ltd., which is an Imperial College London spinout company founded in 2004 by academics from Imperial, University College London and King\u2019s College London.In early November, the partners were awarded a grant for \u00a32.1 million towards the cost of this \u00a33.3m project from the Government-funded Biomedical Catalyst to establish The Brain Health Centre. The aim of the Centre is to make testing for dementia by the NHS quick, cost-effective and seamlessly integrated into the existing patient pathway and health care structure. It will also enable the team to collect valuable data on dementia, which will be used in the development of the assessment system.Dr Wolz adds: \u201cIt is exciting to be able to contribute to this ongoing project. It is very motivating to see my research applied in such a setting. I think that the project has the potential to revolutionise the diagnosis of dementia in day to day practice.\u201d",

Instead of being rewarded for routine office functions like record keeping, GPs will be rewarded for steps which directly support and benefit patients. This includes better control of blood pressure and cholesterol, to prevent heart attacks and stroke and assessing patients at risk from dementia.Millions of pounds will be switched into improving care for patients and making better use of taxpayers' money, Hunt said. The proposed changes will see \u00a3164m pounds taken away from rewarding GPs for bureaucratic tick-box exercises and re-directed into actions which will directly benefit patients. The changes could mean that around 1.5m more patients will get better care in 2013/14 and this could reach as high as 3.5m by 2014/15. The changes should mean more tests, treatments and medicines for patients with diabetes, hypertension, lung disease, heart failure and arthritis \u2013 care that will improve diagnosis, the health of patients and potentially save more lives.\"Getting patients an earlier diagnosis of dementia and supporting those with long-term conditions are my main priorities [and] I want GPs to take the lead in making this happen,\" Hunt said.\"Standards of care in this country must be world class \u2013 and we should  continuously strive to improve. This is why the GP contract must change. Our proposals will make sure we support the patients most in need and will help save lives in practices across the country. We believe GPs can and will rise to these new challenges.\"However, the British Medical Association (BMA), which has not agreed with the changes or the way they were negotiated, said the government had not considered the impact they would have on GP practices.Dr Laurence Buckman, chair of the BMA's GP committee, said: \"Practices are already under huge workload pressures and we have real fears that these proposed changes will result in an even greater load at the same time as forcing through a reduction in core funding. The government's proposals may sound attractive on the face of it and some of their suggestions are good, however they have not fully considered the overall impact on practices of all these changes being implemented together. This could make it difficult for some practices to maintain the level of care they currently offer, let alone increase their capacity to meet the demands of these new proposals.\"He added: \"We also remain unconvinced about the basis for some of the proposed changes, which include asking GPs to refer patients to certain education programmes which do not exist everywhere in the UK.\"",

They are out to make our life as easy aspossible, by removing a lot of the normal everyday pressure of trying to carryon doing things that are becoming difficult and sometimes stressful.In my case my dear wife is my own personal champion andambassador, as she looks after many things that I forget aboutBut to me the mere name Champion or ambassador is simply notenough, because we all have our own champions in life, but none matches thework and care given 24 hours a day by one personWhat is more she does all of this without payment, orgrudges.She is my personalsecretaryAs she answers e-mails on the bad days, and advises me as towhat it all meansMy Nurse As she gets a doctor if I look as if I am getting aninfection.

My problem is that I fail to see whythese people can negotiate all of this, and yet when they make a complete messof things in hospitals etc, they pass the blame on to others or they walk awaywith thousands of pounds as a golden handshake.If you or I made a very bad mistake atwork we would end up getting fired on the spot, and would not get a bonus fordoing it, neither would you expect it.It is my own belief, that these peoplewho are ultimately responsible for all of the services in the care home andhospitals, should make sure that these services are in place and working orthey should resign, as they are clearly doing what they want as opposed togovernment guidelines.What is more they should never get a job in these places ever again.I get tired of hearing that the staffhave to go in their own time to be trained in how to look after people withdementia.Or the people in charge don't see anysense in wasting good money, training people to do the job, something thatreally gets me annoyed.Or there are so many government targetsto be completed that the staff, are overloaded and can't do any more.The government are setting upguidelines to ensure that all carehome staff get good quality training and are paid a good salary to do the job,yet many care home owners use excuses that are so pathetic. Like we don't haveenough computers for the staff to do online training, and anyway we don't paythem to sit and work on computers? So here again those staff who are badly paidare also expected to do online training at home, when they have finished work. Yet these same care home owners arevery well paid supposedly to look after their patients, so where does the moneygo.Every day we hear about patientssitting in soiled clothes, or bedding and staff complaining that people withdementia are just a nuisance.The other day we heard that in one carehome, the patients were got out of bed by the night staff and were made to sitin chairs from 6am, so that the day staff did not have to do so much work?I confess that I don't understand whythese care home owners do not loose their licence to run care homes, ratherthan just giving them a written warning. I have heard of some care home stafftaking online courses to improve themselves and their standard of care, andwere then becoming Dementia Champions. These same people would then sometimestry to improve patient care, and if the care home owner refused to take onboard what was being suggested, they would then move on to care homes whoreally wanted to change their ways and standards.It may take a long time, but eventuallywe will see a better quality of care in hospitals and care homes, and I can seethe time when the bad care homes are simply closed down.We all live in hope",

        "content": "To day I am giving a talk aboutdementia to trainee nurses, and how they can help people like us and theircarers, if we are ever admitted to one of these places, something I confess todreading.I say that because in 2001 I wasadmitted to a large general hospital with a viral pneumonia, and I have hadproblems forgetting the experience.The story as it happened, and was allrecorded in a diary at the timeI have not had any experience of dementia in General Hospitals, but in 2001when I was taken in to hospital with Viral Pneumonia, and I experiencedsomething that was enough to put me off going near a general hospital everagain. This all started when I was admitted attea time and was given an unmade bed. Around an hour later I was given a drip,and was then told by a consultant that I would be having an x-ray. At around11pm, and still without a made up bed, I was taken for an x-ray, after which Iwas told that I could go to bed.However when I returned to the wardthere were no staff present, so I had to attempt to make the bed on my own,with the drip in on arm. To add insult to injury, the next morning, the youngstaff nurse complained to me about the state of my bed, and said somethinglike; I should have found a member of staff to make the bed up.Later on the second night, I was thentransferred to a different hospital where they dealt with chest infections, andafter two days noticed that the lady cleaning the toilets was also rushing backto serve meals? This did not give me very much confidence, as the toilets weredirty, and I had to clean one before using it. The baths also had air beds inthem, so you had to take them out to get a bath.I complained to one young doctor whosaid that I would possibly get better faster at home than in those conditions.A few weeks later the same hospital was given warning that it would be closedif it was not cleaned up.But by then I was told that I hadreleased myself from the hospital so the doctors did not want to know anymore.It took a long time before we were able to explain it all to our own GP whathad happened, and it was only then that they actually believed that I had beentreated so badly.Around two months later that hospitalwhich actually catered for chest infections, was given a warning by theauthorities, that it would be closed down if it did not make significantchanges. Needless to say it was totally rebuilt. So in more ways than one I was luckythat I did not have dementia at that stage, as I cannot remember how I managedto get my pyjamas on that night. So just imagine what would have happened if Ihad dementia at that stage.One Aunt used to be a Ward Sister andher sister was a State Registered Nurse, before they gave it up to havechildren, and they were both horrified at hearing this story. Both tried towork out just how I managed to get my pyjama's on let alone make the bed on myown.One thing the really annoys me aboutBritish hospitals is their habit of having nurses stations in the corridor wellaway from the patients, so they do not have to watch what is going on.However I have heard recently, thatsome hospitals are changing that, by either having a nurses station actually onthe ward where it was years ago, so they can supervise the patients properly,or in some cases they are doing away with them.So we will wait to see what happenstoday",

But rather than panic I just laugh and said its all down to dementia.I thought no more about it until I wentto the toilet. and on the way out I was accosted by a lady who accused me ofbeing rude to those with the illness, She got so verbal that I was worried andrefused to go to the toilet unless my wife went with me and stood outside thedoor. This lady would not accept that I hadLewy Body Dementia and thought I was a care giver. This gave me quite a shock and Iconfess that I did not want to speak at events again for some time.But on other occasions it is quite easyfor us to misunderstand what is being said, and think it is funny when it isnot. I don't understand why it happens, butI get distressed when it is pointed out by my wife. Obviously my brain is not working asfast as it used to do, and sometimes it seems to twist things round.However I have recently bought a bookwritten by the Scottish Living with Dementia Working Group, called, Why am Ilaughing. Many of these people are dear friendsand by reading it I was able to work out who wrote each joke without looking.I found that many others have the samesense of humour and it helped me to get over my fear. However I have some wonderful friends in the Scottish Dementia Working Group, who wrote a book of jokes and got it Published, \"Why am I Laughing\".I lost this signed copy when we were flooded in June, so today I ordered an new copy as I enjoyed reading it so much.This book was written by some of the Working Group, and it was brilliant because I knew them all so well, that I could tell whose joke it was without looking at the name.These people made me realise that I had to retain my sense of humour or go under. Life is hard enough without the PC brigade telling us what we should and should not be doing.So now I know that I am not alone in making mistakes and laughing at them, because that is the only way that I can cope at times, and if I am unable to laugh at myself then its not worth trying to enjoy life.Laugh at your mistakes if you can, because it helps remove the pressure and stress of losing control over your life.",

        "content": "Last weekend I went to a conference,about dementia and religion, and was pleasantly surprised at all of the workthat had been done to help and support those with this illness. This was run and organised by a Christiangroup called, the Christian Council on Aging, CCOA, and I found that there werea lot of people there who were genuinely interested in changing the way thechurches think, especially where illness and age is concerned.In the past I have had major problemstrying to remember things, and got very close to giving up my religion, as Ifelt that the church was not even bothering to keep people with this illness onboard.I had major problems sleeping at one stage due to very vivid nightmares anddreams, and found that I only went into a deep sleep around 6-7am in themorning, so I would not get out of bed till around 8am. When this illness started I lost theability to say the Lord\u2019s Prayer and found it distressing, but after beinggiven the medication I started to learn it again, only to find that when I wentto a church service the words were different, and that was because they wereusing one or other of the modern variations. At this time I also had problemssinging hymns and psalms as I took time to remember the tune, but could not tiethe tunes to the words. So imagine how I felt when they started singing theLord\u2019s Prayer, instead of saying it as I had done for years.Our church kept changing its forms of service and prayers so much that I lostinterest and did not want to go. I also found that people would sit and talkall of the way through the service which made it very hard to concentrate,something that would not have been tolerated in the past, as everyone was toldto be quiet and respect everyone else.I do feel that many religions includingour Church which is the \"Church of England\u201d are trying hard to attractyoungsters into the church without much success as they are not reallyinterested, yet the people who were the mainstay, in as much as they wentregularly and paid more than their fair share of the church income were beingside-lined and in many cases forgotten, and they are the elderly.I have even heard of priests who were not very interested in taking services incare homes, because they thought it was a complete waste of their time andmoney. They say that those in the homes, don'tsing or say their prayers so why bother?. So when these priests go to carehomes, they find that those with memory problems do not know the words andloose interest? so just whose fault is this.I did think this was because they hadforgotten one major factor, and that is people as they get older and those withearly onset dementia, remember the services they were taught either in churchchapel or at school, but the modern church has changed everything to suite theyounger people, including most forms of the service and for some extra ordinaryreason they have many variations of things like the Lord\u2019s Prayer. In desperation I sat down, and aftermany days I had written a letter to a Bishop explaining the problems associatedwith neurological illness and changes to church services, included also was myproblem of sleep patterns. I did this because I was misguidedenough to believe that a Bishop would be sympathetic and understanding, butwhat I shock I got when I got his response.He more or less told me to get up on aSunday morning, and go to 8am Communion where they used the King James Versionof the prayer book, and I would not have any problems.This confirms my fears that all ofthese Bishops were academics who did not live in the real world, and in somerespects did not really care about Joe Public and his problems. But then many of these people havenever had to do a day job as we do, they simply went to university, and theninto the church, with the view that we are their servants and they were thereto change as much as possible while they had the chance, and make life as hardas possible for those who are ill.When we look back to our school days,we had assemblies every day, and many had respect for all around them includingthe teachers, who we looked up to, but now the teachers don\u2019t like assembliesor religious lessons, so is it any wonder that children are in many cases nolonger interested in religion.It\u2019s a pity that these priests don\u2019ttake notice of what is happening around them these days, then the churcheswould be full as they were years ago.

        "content": "The other day I did a presentation tosome student nurses about dementia. I made a mistake and used the wrong word onone occasion, something that my wife pointed out later. Although it was not meant to be rude ornasty, it could have been picked up the wrong way by some, and I was upsetabout it. Although I always type out any speechor talk, in size 14 letters on the computer, I always find that during thespeech, I don't always see all the words that are in front of me, this issomething I find very odd. But I have to write these things outwell in advance, because I make so many mistakes, which I don\u2019t see, until it\u2019stoo late. These days I always get my wife to readeverything and correct any mistakes she finds, although this can be made worseby the fact that I sometimes miss out words, and she has to guess what I wastrying to say, so as you can imagine this is very hard on my wife as well asmyself.When I get an e-mail, I don't alwaysunderstand what it means until I have read it a few times. The problem is that each time I readsomething, I see something different and it gets distressing when I don'tunderstand something or totally misread it, and it's only when my wife readsthe same thing that I realise I have picked it up the wrong way.There are times like this when I reallyhate this illness. It destroys your ability to control your life, and whileassistive technology helps to write things on the computer, it does not helpwith speech or trying to get the correct words out.When I look back to my days at schooland at college, we were always taught how to speak clearly and use the correctwords and grammar, and when I was at work as an engineer, I could write reportsin half an hour to an hour without thinking. Now that has all changed.Simple things like typing have become anightmare. Although I have always been right-handed, I now find that my lefthand is faster than my right hand! So I end up sitting on one hand to get thespelling right. Otherwise the letters of the word are all mixed up, andalthough the letters of the word are all there, they are all jumbled up, whichlooks more like a code than a letter or e-mail.When this first happened it was verydistressing and hard to cope with, but by using voice-activated software likethe Dragon I have been able to get around some of the problems and life hasbecome easier. It is times like this when I realisehow easy it is for people with dementia to be misunderstood by staff inhospitals and care homes, and then be treated with a lack of respect becausethe staff thought they were rude. Many staff don't always realize thatthe person with dementia just made a simple mistake and used the wrong word orwords, something which is taken for granted by those who have normal brains,and yet those with this illness are treated like idiots.However we all make mistakes but underpressure or in the wrong environment we can make more of these without eventhinking about it.Spoken wordWhen we are talking to someone face to face we have problems trying to think ofwhat has been said, and trying to answer without offending the other person. This is not as easy as it looks becauseI confess that I don\u2019t always understand what has been said, and sometimes givethe wrong answer. Although this is a simple task to many,it becomes very difficult and sometimes hazardous at times for those of us withdementia. This of cause could be made worse bythe fact that the other person was speaking fast, they had a strong accent, orthere was loud music, or noise in the background, or other people speaking atthe same time, so all the voices merge into one.Many of these things cause upset, whenyou are struggling to concentrate on a conversation, and this can lead tofrustration, and either walking away or getting agitated, which makes us lookrude or aggressive.Written wordLike many other people I have virtuallylost the ability to use a pen to write at times, and signing my name is embarrassing,as it\u2019s all over the place. This is something I find very distressing when Iget halfway through my name and have to think what comes next. I realised something was wrong yearsago when this happened at work, as I would had to stop halfway through mysurname and think, have I finished or are there other letters. It was also atwork that I realised that while writing out order forms, I was changing fromsmall case to capitals without knowing, and this lead to a lot of distress, asI could not work out what was going on. Needless to say it also cost a lot ofmoney in destroyed order forms which could not be used, so my employer was notat all happy.A lot of problems are also made worseby the fact that many of us lose the ability to type and even write articles orletters, and sometimes make horrific spelling mistakes, even using the wrongword can make the article look as if you are being arrogant or rude, and that\u2019snot intentional. The wrong word can also change themeaning of what you are trying to get over, and although it may not be obviousto us, it will be to others.But as I stated before finding theright word is not always easy when you are out of your comfort zone or tryinghard to wright something but cannot get the wording to sound right As in Spoken word topics, many likemyself sometimes get so flustered that it can end up with aggression, somethingthat we all hate, yet we cannot do anything about it. I know that it\u2019s just sheerfrustration, but in our case it sometimes comes out as this aggression, andit\u2019s usually when I feel that I cannot work something simple out, or the rightwords will not come out.This has lead me to stop attending some meetings, as things go wrong if I amnot comfortable, with the settings or sometimes the people in the room. Although in many of the high profiledementia meetings most people respect the fact that I have dementia and makeallowances.Music which distorts our thoughtsSometimes music can have dramaticeffects on those with dementia, and it ends up causing agitation or aggression.I was once listening to some classicalmusic, something I really liked and then all hell broke out as this hadobviously triggered something in my brain, so I never played it again. My poor wife was in the room at thetime and she got a shock, but at least she now knows about this. Yet I have listened to some of Wagner\u2019smusic and it had no effect on me at all which surprised both myself and mywife, as that is very dark. If I am out shopping and the shop hasloud music playing, I often have to leave otherwise I get upset as I cannotthink properlyI like classical music in the background, as it can sometimes help me to concentrate, but there have beenoccasions when it\u2019s had the wrong effect, and I ended up being agitated. I have found that some pieces of musicwhich are quite relaxing at the best of times, can have the opposite effectwhen you least expect it to happen. As a person who struggles with nastynightmares at nights I often listen to classical music, but found it sometimesdid horrible things to my way of thinking or trying to relax, so in the endmany of these tracks were removed, from my collection. Sadly I found that some music causeshavoc when I am trying to write on the computer, so there are days when I don\u2019thave anything playing at all. I also struggle with my concentrationon the best of days, and if someone speaks when I am doing my best to worksomething out, I find that everything falls apart, and I have to start thinkingall over again.Having said that, I know that myhearing is going, and often jump a mile if my wife or someone else walks up andtouches my back, when I am concentrating, especially if I don\u2019t have my hearingaids in.Perhaps I need to start again with anew brain or reconditioned bodyThrough my blog (ken-kenc.blogspot.com)I can explain my life, my problems with dementia and my efforts to get aroundthe problems. Although writing my blog can be painful at times, it helps me tounderstand that there are other people out there around the world who are inneed of advice, or perhaps need to understand more about the illness, soperhaps by doing this blog, I am not only helping myself but I am helping manyothers as well.",

I stopped going to a lot of meetingswhich were, not kept in control by a strong chairperson, because it wasbecoming very difficult to listen to the main topic while others chatted amongthemselves, as well as the mobile phones which kept going off, because peoplewould not switch them to silent.

It seems very strange that many people didnot have these items till the last twenty years, now it seems that many willnot go anywhere without one of these things firmly clamped to their ears,whether in the street, in a meeting or travelling on a train, and you have tolisten to their exploits from that day or the night before, which to me isembarrassing but it means nothing to that person themselves.Yesterday I went with my wife to book aholiday, and found that the noise in the Travel agents was so horrific that Iremoved my hearing aids, as every one's voice was merging into one, just likeone of my horrible nightmares, and I had to leave all the decisions to my wife,who by this stage in life is used to it.But I often wonder why it is thatpeople these days have to speak to loud, and don't think of trying to speakquietly so they are not disrupting other peoples conversations or in our case\"our thoughts\".It seems we are all trying to outdo each other. The same thing happens when we goshopping and it seems that each shop has loud music being pumped out of thedoors, so by the time you get into the shop you cannot think. I know that atwork we had regulations concerning the noise from machines etc, yet there doesnot seem to be anything covering working in shops when they have loud music. Another thing which seems to get mewound up is when we go into a supermarket, and someone keeps shouting over atannoy system, and repeats themselves three or four times by which time, I haveforgotten what I am looking for. These places are becoming a nightmare to me,and I am starting to hate them, either because of the tannoy systems or the madidiots with the trolleys who go hurtling round the aisles as if they wereracing.Or is it the fact that through my LewyBody Dementia, my brain these days is now struggling to pick up sounds, andsome sounds are much are louder that others.I wish my blog could write this outwithout all of the mistakes and misspellings I keep finding, but at least I canstill use spell check when I remember to use it.",

Remember that many get frustratedbecause, unlike many people they simply cannot come straight out with theanswer, and if things go wrong we sometimes come out with the wrong words, andthat leads to accusations of aggressive behaviour or us being rude. I haveheard this on many occasions, which makes me believe that the accusers reallydon\u2019t have a clue about this illness.Please don\u2019t assume that you know allof the answers about dementia and what it is like to live with it, but ask us.We are living with it and therefore we can tell you about our problems.Remember that people with strongaccents, asking questions can be very difficult to understand, when you havethis illness. As someone who grew up in the North East, I now struggle with theaccents these days and if it is difficult for me, what is it like for others.Many have hearing problems which may beacute as in Lewy Body Dementia and other may be losing their hearing, so theymay not be able to understand clearly what you are saying, so please acceptthis, as this causes us stress at times, and that could lead to us beingaccused of being rude or aggressive.Try to speak in a calm clear voice andnot get agitated, otherwise it makes those with the illness react in the sameway.Do not discuss our problems withsomeone else while we are there, as that is hurtful and disrespectful, we haveears and a tongue and can answer for ourselves given the chance and the time.Many of us have developed routines thatwe go through each day, and we should be allowed to carry on with these, as itallows us to be in control for that little bit longer. It also decreases thedecisions that we need to make on a regular basis.Some people are struggling to come toterms with this illness, some even deny they have it after the diagnosis, andit is up to you all to give us the support and care we need.Some people struggle with certain typesof flooring as with marble or vinyl floors, and may see things which are notthere, and this causes distress. Marble floors are one of the worst things on abad day when you have dementia, as it looks as if the designs are moving, andthis has given me many nightmares in the past.Revolving doors and elevators are adisaster as guess the time to get into or onto them is out of this world. Mywife always goes down the elevator in front of me, and we don\u2019t use revolvingdoors unless there is no other way in or out of the building.Large mirrors especially full sizeones, can cause problems in rooms such as hotel bathrooms and bedrooms; it\u2019snot the first time that I have walked into a mirror thinking it was a door,because I could see a door reflected in it. Remember our carers and family are oursupport at all times, and if we go into hospital they should be there all ormost of the time to help us answer questions, and support us if we need to fillin consent forms, otherwise we could be signing our lives away.

It was surprising just how long it took to do, once we had drained the water out, and now we will just have to sit back and see whether there is any long term damage to the fish. It's taken four long years to set this aquarium up and have it stocked with some wonderful fish, and I would be horrified if anything went wrong now as I get so much pleasure from sitting watching it each dayI know that like other pets I can not take them for walks etc, but when you go near to them they always respond, and that means so much to me.I also got my driving license back today, which was a bonus because I never expected to get it this year.",

We then had lunch before heading back home again.I have to admit these children and a delight to take out for meals as they are usually very well behaved.After this things went downhilland I had to go to bed for an hour to charge my batteries, as I was really struggling to cope with three voices all talking together, and it was like a bad dream.Today is a new start and we will wait to see what happens.

        "content": "Some time ago we were flooded and our lives were turned upside down, so with the help of notes, I have rewritten the story.Its been a long hard learning curve since the end of June thisyear, and it has taken its toll on many people in our area.On June 28th we were packing to go on a Baltic cruise the following day to celebrate my 65th birthday, and never really thought about what was coming. Just after teathe rain came and it was torrential, but it took some time before we all realised that things were going to turn ugly.By around 8pm the water was pouring through the town centre, and eventually it got so bad that a wall of water was heading our way just like a small tsunami.Within 20 minutes we had nearly 3ft of water inside the house above the floor and another one and a half feet below the floor, and it came in so fast that we lost most of our possessions on the ground floor.The next morning a new life started when I went down into the sea of mud and saw what was left of our life's possessions.I then felt sick, at the thought of what was to come, but at this time I was not able to take on board the problems that were to come.We removed as move of the sludge as we could and when the insurance man came four days later and told us that we could not stay i n the house, our hearts sank.We were moved into a hotel for around 10 days, and then into a small flat, which was going to push me to the limits.Although the flat was small and easy to get round, it was in a three storey blockwith fire doors.Night after night day after day people would go in and out, letting go of the fire doors, which then slammed. My wife said that I physically left the bed one night with the shock of the slamming doors.I have now got to November and we hope to be out of this flat within 6 weeks as it will not come quick enough for me. I have struggled through every emotion possible and have realised what depression is and how close I have been like many others from our estate to walking away and finishing it all together. I know in my own mind that I am not suicidal, but I have been to some dark places over the last few months, and this has not helped my dementia at all.Many people we have spoken to have said that the flood destroyed their lives and many quiet loving people became angry and someone who snapped at their loved ones for no reason at all.Last week was awful, and possibly the worst week of the whole lot, and should have been a good week as it was our Ruby anniversary, but we seem to have turned the corner and things are starting to look up again.I went for a memory test on Friday and both the nurse and my wife were surprised that I did so well in the tests, after all we had been through.I know that its not the same but I can just about understand what those in the far east went through when the tsunami struck, although it was far more dangerous and unforgiving, and now my heart goes out to all who suffered in these events. I could not understand what they went through before our flood, but its given me a good idea, of the pressures and stress that people were under afterwards.I have never been depressed before and never want to go there again, as it was horrible. But the only things that kept me going where my family, grandchildren, and my tropical fish aquarium which was moved into the garage until the house is repaired. I know that fish can not speak, but going to feed them every day, that gave the impression that they were pleased to see me and it all helped keep me going.Its taken me 4 years to get this aquarium setup and working well, and I started doing it to help my memory and help me relax, so its a major part of my life and this fish, silly as it may sound are an extended family, and I only hope that we can get them all back in the house before winter sets in properly, because I don't think they will survive and that will be upsetting after all we have gone through in the family.God willing we will all come through this and come out the other side before much longer.",

After this all of the new doors will be fitted ready for the painters to come in to finish off. We have now got dates for the carpet fitters, which can be changed if the works gets ahead of schedule, and also have a moving in date.If this is completed early then with luck we may move in earlier, as all of the carpets are ordered and in stock.I confess that I am now looking forward to the next 6 weeks being over so we can return to our house and not have noisy doors slamming all day and all hours of thenight.I just hope that nothing else goes wrong.",

        "content": "Day to Day living with DLBAs someone with Lewy body dementia, Iwas not prepared for the changes in life that were to come, but as with allillnesses, we have to change our lives to suite, whether we like it or not.There is no doubt that caring for a person with Dementia can be frustrating anddifficult, but it\u2019s even more difficult for those with the illness to copewith.Each person has vastly different symptoms and problems, but we have to do thebest we can and that usually means that we have to change our ways of dealingwith everyday things, such as personal care, hobbies, routines and solvingproblems.RoutineWhen I was diagnosed I was told a few things to make life easier, like settingmyself a routine to get through the day; this would take in personal care andmedication.If you have a set routine it causes less stress and worry, to those withdementia and also helpstheir carers, as they don\u2019t need to prompt us as much.I started to set myself a routine which works well until something happenswhich distracts me, like someone coming to the door, or perhaps the telephonerings, after which everything goes haywire.Reminders for medication can be done in many different ways, but mine is set onmy mobile phone which stays in my pocket, from getting up in the morning untilI switch it off on a night.As far as my medication is concerned this is all set out by my wife in a dailydose box, and that removes one problem from me as I don\u2019t have to go and get myown medication, because like many other people I have more than one type oftablet, and I don\u2019t want to take the wrong tablets.Hobbies and assistive technologyMaintaining hobbies has to be a priority but it is not always easy when youhave this illness, and it can be stressful when things start to slide away fromyou, but when I was diagnosed my consultant told me, to accept that thingswould change, and not to fight it otherwise I would end up being stressed.In her own words, if you cannot do something you enjoy one day, leave it andtry another day, if that fails try on a third day , but if it fails on thethird attempt, leave it well alone as you will end up getting annoyed andagitated, which will make life harder for those around you.Whether we like it or not most of us use assistive technology in one form oranother, hearing aids, glasses, and so the list goes on, but in our case itpromotes independence and cuts down our reliance on others.With this in mind most of my hobbies have changed in one way or another, eitherbecause they are difficult to do or they have become too dangerous to attempt.But like many others in the early stages of the illness we try to remain activeand if that means taking on new hobbies where possible we should at least try,and using assistive technology, can also help with many things.Assistive technology causes many problems when it comes to professionals, asmany think we should not go down that route.I was once at a meeting in London where I was told that the use of this type ofthing was against our civil liberties, and this really annoyed me as it was asocial worker who was saying it. My answer to that was, that in my view we loseour civil liberties when we are diagnosed with this illness, but assistivetechnology plays a very important part in life of everyone in this world, sowhy is it so wrong for us to use it.To be very honest if we can get used to it at an early stage in the illness, weunderstand what it can do in the way of allowing us to carry on enjoying ourfreedom without someone tagging along for our protection. Our families andloved ones have enough to do in life and if this allows us to enjoy our freedomfor that little bit longer, then so be it.One of my favourite hobbies on good days is photography, but to carry on withthis I needed to buy extra things like a camera tripod and a remote switch, sothat on bad days when I have shakes, I could still take photographs withouthaving to touch the camera after it has been set up.Assistive technology is also a godsend to others like myself who use thecomputer a lot, or at least try to hang on to it, I find I have days when Icannot use the computer keyboard properly, so now I use voice activatedsoftware.There are times when I know what I want to write, but as soon as I sit down andstart typing, the words all disappear, so by using this I simply talk and thewords are automatically written for me.I know that there are gadgets on the market such as the buddy system somethingwhich I trialled with Durham county council, and it works well in tracking aperson with dementia.While the system was easy to use it was also easy for my wife to track on thecomputer although she would not be able to tell which pub I was in, and ifneeded someone from the council could come out to find me.Staying activeKeeping fit is very important to all, but like many I have lost co-ordinationin swimming, so I had to stop, as I swallowed too much water. The reason wasthat every time I moved my arms my mouth started to open, so it was a case ofstopping before something happenedI was referred to the local gym, as one doctor said that I was overweight, butthere were problems here, because the staff did not really understand dementiaor memory problems, and left me to it without support.On the second day I felloff the back of the tread mill three times and was told to stop larking around.The fact was that the machine was set at a high speed and I could not get itturned down in time. So in the end I gave up going to the gym and carried onwalking instead, as that could be done at my speed without machines to thinkabout.SleepIt is very important to get a good night\u2019s sleep, or so we are told, yet sleepdisturbances are common with people who have this illness, and sometimes thiscan be distressing as I found when I started having horrendous dreams andnightmares which would not go away. When I wake up from these, I sometimeslisten to some calming music on my music player, which stays next to the bed.But I once found to my horror that some music which I enjoyed during the dayhad bad repercussions at night, so through trial and error and now I only havecertain music with me at all times.NoiseGeneral Noise and background noise can also play a major part in a person\u2019slife when they have this illness, as many like me find that their hearingstarts to go. I found my own hearing became acute through the Lewy bodydementia, but at the same time I Need hearing aids as I struggle with thetelevision and when I am in meetings.So allowances need to be made for this in life, because too much noise cancause a lot of distress and unnecessary agitation. Too much noise can also makeit harder to think and concentrate on what you are doing.Life Story workMy consultant told me that I should go home and spend time writing my lifestory, so that I had something for my family to read in the future includingany grandchildren, as at that time I had not expected to see any while I wasstill alive.One of the main reasons for this was that it helps us remember what we did andwhere we came from, especially later on in the illness, although many peoplewith dementia, can remember their childhood and early life very easy, butstruggle with present day things.Originally I was told to write this story before I was given any medication soI never expected to get as far as I did, but it took my mind off the future alltogether, and at this time we heard that our daughter was pregnant and afterthree miscarriages was going to have her first child.We now have three wonderful grandchildren, so I have an extra reason tocomplete this story as I would like to share this with them given the chance,giving them more of a chance to see who I really was and where I came from. At first I found it very hard tounderstand why I was doing this, but then I realised that most of my life wasuntold, and even my dear wife did not know much about my early life, andalthough we knew each other in the teenage years through Scouts and Guides,there was quite a lot of gaps where the information was missing.These life stories will also helpcarers (or Care Givers ) along with care staff to understand who they arelooking after, and what these people did in life, such as where they were born,where they lived, who they married and who their children and grandchildrenare, along with their pastimes hobbies, likes and dislikes. This will in theend give them a clear picture of who they are looking after.They will also give loved ones andfamily members something to remember their loved one by, as it will share allthe happy memories this person wants them to have. Since starting my life story it hastaken on astronomic proportions, as I kept remembering things that were said bymy family and relatives. One of these days I will have to stop, and see if Ican get it all printed and backed, for my grandchildren in the future.I can recommend this to anyone who is starting on this journey as it not onlybrings back all of the happy memories, but takes our minds off what may becoming further down the road.",

        "content": "A favoriteblog page which was saved from my old blog, and has given so much pleasure.Some time ago my daughter Claire, triedto explain to our wonderful Grandchildren that I had Lewy Body Dementia, andthought the easiest way was to say that I had old timers illness, which soundedlovely. I found it hard when the children would treat me with kid gloves attimes,but it was Claire's way of protecting me at times.Last Monday we travelled down to Londonwhere we stayed over in a hotel for a night, before going to a meeting aboutDementia. After this we headed off to our daughters in Farnborough in Hampshirewhere we stayed till Saturday.During the week we walked to schoolwith one Grandchild or the other as both girls are in different schools, but itwas so nice when they hang on to your hand and talk to you and confess that attimes it was very hard to take as I was starting to get emotional.On the Thursday Claire had to take onedaughter straight into town from school, to get her feet measured, and asthings were going to be tight, and my wife was needed to keep an eye on thegrandson who is the youngest and gets into everything.So she asked if I would be alright going up to the school to pick up theyoungest from the primary school which is about 1 1/2 miles away. I have walked this route on mayoccasions, and enjoy the walk, as it is relaxing, so I agreed to do it. Having got to the school, I waited aseveryone came out, and the teacher looked at me and asked who I was waitingfor, and I explained. I had seen my grand daughter wandering round theclassroom, but she was in her own little world, and perhaps because she had notseen her mum she did not come out.She asked where everyone was and Iexplained and said that we were walking home. On the way I asked what she hadbeen doing at school and whether she had enjoyed herself. She was quiet atfirst, but then started talking about spellings, and how she sometimes getsthings wrong or spelt the wrong way, as some words sound differently to the waythey are spelt.I said that I loved spelling when I was at school, but these days I can not alwaysremember how words are spelt( and without spell check I would not be doingthis, although sometimes spell check can not fathom out the words I am tryingto spell) so I am stuck.She looked up at me and said. ButGrampy you have an excuse as you have old timers?I confess that I was taken back by thisand felt very tearful as this little girl of five had remembered this, and Ifelt very humbled that she was being so thoughtful in what she said, and forsomeone 5 year old that takes some imagination.We had a long talk going home, andafter she had changed out of her school uniform, she came back downstairs andstarted talking again, sounding so old for her age. As Claire has said on manyoccasions she is 5 year old, yet there are times she sounds more like 35. I had trouble trying to explain this tomy wife and Claire, because I was still close to tears, the effect had beensomething I had never expected, as it was so spontaneous.So it proves that children canunderstand more about this illness that we accept, and possible think moreabout it than adults. 1 comment",

Reassure your child with simple, honestexplanations of the disease. By Mayo Clinic staff Watching a loved one progress throughthe stages of Alzheimer's disease can be frightening, even for adults. Imaginebeing a child struggling to understand why grandma is acting so strangely orcan't remember who you are. You can help by offering comfort and support whenneeded. Anticipate your child's questionsWhen your child asks questions, respondwith simple, honest answers. For example: \u00b7 What's wrong with grandma? Explainthat Alzheimer's is a disease. Just as children get colds and tummy aches,older adults sometimes get an illness that causes them to act differently andto forget things. They might look the same on the outside, but their brains arechanging on the inside.\u00b7 Doesn't grandpa love me anymore? Ifthe person who has Alzheimer's disease no longer recognizes your child, he orshe might feel rejected. Remind your child that the disease makes it hard foryour loved one to remember things \u2014 but your child is still an important partof the person's life.\u00b7 Is it my fault? If the person who hasAlzheimer's accuses your child of some wrongdoing \u2014 such as misplacing a purseor keys \u2014 your child might feel responsible. Explain to your child that he orshe isn't to blame.\u00b7 Will you get Alzheimer's? Reassureyour child that Alzheimer's disease isn't contagious. Most people don't getAlzheimer's.\u00b7 What will happen next? If you'll becaring for the person who has Alzheimer's in your home, prepare your child forthe changes in routine. Explain to your child that your loved one will havegood days and bad days. Reassure your child that he or she is loved \u2014 no matterwhat the future holds.If your child has trouble talking aboutthe situation or withdraws from your loved one, open the conversation. Ask whatchanges your child has noticed in the loved one who has Alzheimer's disease.Your child's observations might lead naturally to an exploration of his or herown feelings and worries. Tell your child it's OK to feel nervous, sad orangry. You feel that way sometimes, too. To boost your child's understanding ofAlzheimer's, read age-appropriate books on the disease or take advantage ofother educational resources. Be prepared for emotional expressionYour child might express his or heremotions in seemingly indirect ways. For example, he or she might complain ofheadaches or other physical issues. Your child's attention to schoolwork mightbegin to slide. If you're caring for your loved one in your home, your childmight be reluctant to invite friends to the house \u2014 or he or she might look forways to spend time away from home. If you notice these types ofbehaviour\u2019s, gently point out what you've observed \u2014 and offer your childcomfort and support. Listen to your child's concerns, and help your child feelsafe in sharing his or her feelings. Stay involvedTo help your child stay connected tothe person who has Alzheimer's, involve both of them in familiar activities \u2014such as setting the table together. Shared leisure time is important, too. Evenyoung children can stay connected with a loved one who has Alzheimer's bypaging through photo albums, listening to music or doing other simpleactivities together. If your child becomes impatient withyour loved one, remind your child that the behaviour isn't intentional \u2014 it's aresult of the disease. Together, focus on finding ways to show your loved onehow much you love him or her. Even if your loved one forgets your child's name,he or she can still feel love and kindness.

Apart from seeing parts of the worldwhich look fascinating, like Singapore where we went with the Alzheimer'sSociety to the Alzheimer's Disease International Conference, but then I amunsure as to where I would go because long journey's cause a lot of stress. There are parts of the world whichfascinate me and would love to go but would never be able to afford the costs.However I would love to do somethingstupid like a parachute jump, or wing walk for charity, providing of course thatsomeone paid for it and also paid a large sum of money to a chosen charity.Am I stupid, I don't know, certainly mywife thinks I am, but I would never have even considered this years ago beforemy diagnosis, so perhaps I must have lost my fear of things like this, or Ijust want to do something like this before the illness gets any worse. I could never do a bungee jump, as Iwould be terrified of the rope snapping, but why am I not frightened of theother two, I really don't know.I suppose with these two you arestrapped on to something, which is a form of security.In 2007 my son decided to do the Coastto Coast cycle ride,but as things turned out he could not get anyone to joinhim, and one day suggested that I should join him, but I don't think either heor my dear wife expected me to take him up and do it. I still don't know whatmade me agree to do it.It took over three months of trainingto get fit enough, and get used to the bicycle, which in the end was part ofme, and I got so relaxed I would do parts of the journey on my own, as it wasaway from traffic.When we started it was difficult to stay up right and stable on the tracks, andI had problems at times with sharp corners, as I could not always judge them.However after a while I felt as if I had never been away from a bicycle. I used too cycle to work each daybefore I became unstable and stopped, and confess that I never ever expected toget back to it. Yet once I got past the first month Igot less and less stiff, in myself, and enjoyed it. After the big event I feltas it I had wrecked my right knee and hip, and had problems for quite a while,and still do on cold days or after a bad night. Although it was hard work, and braindraining at times, I really enjoyed it, as it was an experience that I neverthought I would ever try let alone complete. The second day was hell as I keptforgetting which gears were which, and felt like throwing the bike into astream on two occasions. However the fundraising side of thistook its tole on my family, and we all agreed we could never do it again, as itwas all down to family and friends, although we did raise around \u00a33,000 for ourlocal branch of the Alzheimer's Society.But I don't think I could get insurancefor this anyway, as travel insurance is well out of my league, so much so thatlast year we went to Malta and my insurance cost just as much as the holiday,all because of this illness Lewy Body Dementia.So perhaps I will have to just thinkabout this and imagine what it would be like to do it. This illness makes you think of allsorts of stupid things at times, but I guess its because we feel as if time isrunning out, so perhaps I should just take it easy and behave myself. ",

        "content": "These days we hear all about dementia champions etc., butnever much about the caring champions.Caring for anyone with an illness or serious injury canbe difficult and at times very hard to cope with. But when someone with dementia gets a diagnosis, it iscommonly sad the they family start to grieve as the person they are lookingafter will change in time, and will not be the same person they have grown upwith and loved.I confess that it\u2019s bad enough having the illness andtrying to cope with whatever life throws at you. But our caregivers mean so much to us, andhave so much to put up with over the years.Our caregivers are not just our partners in this illness,they are in many cases someone we married many years ago, and we agreed that wewould stay with them in sickness and in health, until death us do part, as saidin the marriage vows. Yet thinking about it now, I know that I may look likethe same person Janice married years ago in 1972, but when I stand up to dosomething or same something, I become a vastly different person. As my dearwife has said on many occasions, I am not the person she married all of thoseyears ago.But having said that I confess that I cannot get near toimagine, what she goes through on a daily basis. Her role as my carer or care giver has changed from theone she was used to, and that was being my loving wife. Yes she still is myloving wife, and I would not change her for anything in the world, nor could Ido without her as she is my rock and support when the wheels come off. But herrole has changed so much, and it hurts me at times This illness has changed me in many ways, the way I think,and my personality have all changed since the diagnosis. Yes a person withdementia looks quite normal from the outside, but we have changed inwardly, andsometimes we don\u2019t appreciate or understand these changes. It\u2019s as if the brainis now controlling me rather than the other way round.For years I was my own person and proud of it, I did notneed to be protected nor did I want people telling me how to do things, ordoing it for me. I was an engineer and did estimating, costing, writingreports, as well as doing budgets, yet that is all but a mere memory, and thesedays its very confusing looking at figures and letters, trying to understandwhat things mean.Yes I did what I wanted to do, the way I wanted, but now,I have to work things to suite others and that can be upsetting. I was secure and felt strong, yet now I feel veryinsecure at times.Now I find myself more and more dependent on others inthe family, and that includes my big champion my dear wife.As prominent person with dementia in America (Dr RichardTaylor) once said, I am not sure whether my wife is my champion or my hero. Heroes are shared with others. Champions are more personal.Heroes are worshipped from afar. Where champions generally embrace the values and feelingsof those they champion. With heroes is usually the other way around. So perhaps in many ways Janice is my personal champion,and that means quite a lot to me.These people are our personal champions, our Hero\u2019salthough we normally speak of Hero\u2019s being someone who is shared by manypeople, but I do think my wife is my Champion as she cares for me, and helps mefeel more secure, no matter where I am, and like others she looks out for me allthe way through the illness, and supports me when I get stuck. They are sometimes our personal driverOur personal SecretaryOur advisorOur travel booking agency, and travel companionOur personal nurse who sorts out our daily care andmedicationOur personal handy person, when we forget what we need todo.Our Gardener when we are unsurePersonal Cheerleader, yes because without them constantlysaying we are doing fine, we would simply give up. My Financial managerMy SpokesmanWhen I am attempting to write a talk, she usually checksit and edits it, because my brain goes faster than my hands, and I end upmissing words out, or sections just seem to disappear and things don\u2019t soundright.Janice sorts out the washing machine that is toodifficult to work out, and iron our clothes so that we look clean and tidy whenwe go out. I use to enjoy ironing but now, I get the creases in thewrong place most of the time Theses loving people must get frustrated by us asking thesame questions over and over again. Do they trust us to do anything without making a total pig\u2019sear of it?Janice has protected me throughout, but allows me to dowhat I want, within reason, in the hope, that I will realise what it\u2019s time tohang up my boots and stop doing certain things. It\u2019s a very slow and hardprocess doing this.It\u2019s very hard to accept defeat or ask for help, and Iguess that\u2019s just a man thing, Never Admit to being unable to do anything, asit makes us look foolish. But to be honest I feel we are only fooling ourselves,and there comes a time when we have to say enough is enough.Everyday has to be a drain on her, as we are no longerthe team we were, working together to build a good life for us both and when weworked together to achieve our aims, now she has to do most of this workherself, because she usually ends up correcting the things I have attempted todo on my own. I am now more dependent on Janice than I ever dreamt of,and if anything were to happen to her tomorrow the world would all end for me.A few years ago she fell and broke her ankle, so I was upgradedto chief, cleaner shopper and driver. I don\u2019t usually go near to the car thesedays unless she is there, even though I have driven thousands of mile in mylife, I no longer feel quite at home in the car any more and won't get in todrive unless she is with me.But I could not have done the shopping without her beingon the end of the mobile phone. Where is this usually found, what kind of thisor that do we use, and what does it look like, all of which must have drivenher up the wall. It was a terrific drain on me, let alone poor Janice, but inthat instance our roles had changed.But when you have an illness like this, shops become anightmare place where we don\u2019t like being, because some buffoon keeps movingthe shelves and their contents around just to confuse us. As well as negotiating all of the different aisles withthousands of things on, and we are trying to work out where each item is, wealso have to watch for all of the mad high speed idiots with the trolleys, therows of storage trolleys waiting to be unloaded, as well as the staff who nowpull full trolleys towards you while walking backwards. It\u2019s all mind blowingto us and very confusing.So yes I would be lost without my personal champion ",

        "content": "                  Someone asked the other day, 'What was your favourite 'fast food'    when you were growing up?'    'We didn't have fast food when I was growing up,' I informed him.    'All the food was slow.'    'C'mon, seriously.. Where did you eat?'    'It was a place called 'home,'' I explained.    'Mum cooked every day and when Dad got home from work, we sat down together    at the dining room table, and if I didn't like what she put on my plate, I    was allowed to sit there until I did like it.'        By this time, the lad was laughing so hard I was afraid he was going    to suffer serious internal damage, so I didn't tell him the part about how    I had to have permission to leave the table.        But here are some other things I would have told him about my childhood if    I'd figured his system could have handled it:        Some parents NEVER owned their own house, wore jeans, set foot on a golf    course, travelled out of the country or had a credit card.        My parents never drove me to school. I had a bicycle that weighed probably 50    pounds, and only had one speed, (slow).        We didn't have a television in our house until I was 10.    It was, of course, black and white, and the station went off the air at 10    pm, after playing the national anthem and epilogue; it came back on the air    at about 6 a.m. And there was usually a locally produced news and farm show    on, featuring local people...        I never had a telephone in my room. The only phone was on a party    line. Before you could dial, you had to listen and make sure some people    you didn't know weren't already using the line.        Pizzas were not delivered to our home... but milk was.        All newspapers were delivered by boys and all boys delivered    newspapers--My brother delivered a newspaper, seven days a week. He had to    get up at 6AM every morning.                         Film stars kissed with their mouths shut. At least, they did in the films.    There were no movie ratings because all movies were responsibly produced    for everyone to enjoy viewing, without profanity or violence or almost    anything offensive.        If you grew up in a generation before there was fast food, you may    want to share some of these memories with your children or grandchildren.    Just don't blame me if they bust a gut laughing.                Growing up isn't what it used to be, is it?        MEMORIES from a friend:    My Dad is cleaning out my grandmother's house (she died in December) and he    brought me an old Royal Crown Cola bottle. In the bottle top    was a stopper with a bunch of holes in it... I knew    immediately what it was, but my daughter had no idea. She    thought they had tried to make it a salt shaker or something. I    knew it as the bottle that sat on the end of the ironing board to    'sprinkle' clothes with because we didn't have steam irons.    Man, I am old.        How many do you remember?    Headlight dip-switches on the floor of the car.    Ignition switches on the dashboard.    Trouser leg clips for bicycles without chain guards.    Soldering irons you heated on a gas burner.    Using hand signals for cars without turn indicators.        Older Than Dirt Quiz:    Count all the ones that you remember, not the ones you were told about.    Ratings at the bottom.        1. Sweet cigarettes    2. Coffee shops with jukeboxes    3. Home milk delivery in glass bottles    4. Party lines on the telephone    5. Newsreels before the movie    6. TV test patterns that came on at night after the last show and    were there until TV shows started again in the morning.. (There were only 2    channels[if you were fortunate])    7. Peashooters    8.. 33 rpm records    9. 45 RPM records    10.78 RPM records    11. Hi-fi's    12. Metal ice trays with levers    13. Blue flashbulb    14. Cork popguns    15. Wash tub wringers    16. Spud guns    17. Making your own bow and arrows    18. Going out to play and going home at 'meal time'        If you remembered 0-3 = you're still young    If you remembered 3-6 = You are getting older    If you remembered 7-11 = Don't tell your age    If you remembered 12-15 = You're positively ancient!        I must be 'positively ancient' but those memories are some of the    best parts of my life.        Don't forget to pass this along!!    Especially to all your reallyOLDfriends....

As they were all modern art and something many finddifficult to work out, it took some time before people started to speak aboutwhat they could see in the pictures.I confess that I was not impressed at first, thenrealised that these people could all see different things, from the samepicture and after a while I started to see things which were not easy to see inthe first place. I ended up enjoying the experience , although I am not a fanof modern art work. Although many people who have dementia love to paint anddraw, there are times when it becomes difficult to get the picture right,especially if it is down to look like a scene outside. I often give up in totalfrustration because it never looks the same but I guess this is all down to thespacial awareness side of things, where everything looks so very different inour eyes from day to day. I used to love drawing when I was younger, and I thinklooking back this makes life so much harder as all this has gone.It is difficult to get distances right and sometimesangles, yet as an engineer I would sketch or draw out things that were neededand then go back to the office knowing full well that I had an accurate drawingof what was needed, but now that the brain has changed all of this is all butin the past.Artwork can be relaxing when it works well, however Ioften look at something and see something which is not really there at all.I sometimes find pastels easier to use although I wouldlove to do water colours, as it looks nicer.",

        "content": "I have just returned from two days in London, where we were working with the Life Story Network.The highlight of thiswas being allowed to sit and watch the proceedings in the Chamber of the House of Lords.Before this, a few people gave talks about the positives of Life Story Work, which was given in front of someimportant members of the house of Lords.I do think Life Story work is very important to all who are on the dementia journey, as it allows them to talk about their lives and explain, where they came from, their jobs, families, and any highlights. Many of us have things in our lives which were unknown to our families and loved ones. So this is an opportunity to tell it all and get it written down, and if possible have any photographs put into the same book. This can then be kept as a memory so that our future grandchildren can really learn about us.When I was diagnosed, I was told by my consultant, to go home and start to write my life story. This was for two reasons. The first was, to get me to explain who I was and what I did in life. The second reason was, it would keep me occupied and therefore keep my brain active.In everyone's life there may well be things which we don't want to talk about, and these subjects should be treated with care, and not exposed as they could be sensitive.There will also be many happy memories we want to share, as well as things we did which made us proud, but perhaps did not talk about. These could be spoken about and explored.I myself worked for the Alzheimer's Society as a volunteer for many years, and did talks around the country as well as media and television work. But many events were not publicised as Idid not like being in the public eye, and as explained on many occasions, I did not do it for myself or for the publicity but it was done to help others. I was extremely lucky in so much as I could do this work to help others less fortunate, and although I enjoyed it and it kept my brain active, I would not havetalked about itThe funny thing about the media work was, that my grandchildren could not work out just how I was on Television at times,and they could not accept me being on television.This was well before I started using things like face book etc, and even though I use this social media today, its not for me , but I have enjoyed helping others out by answering questions, and it gives me a lot of pride in doing it.",

        "content": "Like many people I struggle with signs, whether at the roadside or in buildings.One of my main concernsis reading a toilet sign when I am on my own and this can be distressing on the days when I am not feeling very good.The only way I can get my head round this is to tell myself that a man has two legs, where the ladies toilet sign has a person with what looks like one leg and a skirt. Saying that I would be in serous trouble if I was Scottish, as the men wear Kilts.But it causes no end of trouble.As well as that many hotel call there rooms by different names, so you have to start trying to understand what the name means there before going any further.I often think that hotels could be more dementia friendly if each floor was a different colour so even if you forgot the number, you could find the right floor by looking at the colour, but perhaps that will never happen.When I was working as an engineer I understood that all signs were to be standardised, but this did not happen, and its seems that many modern hotels do there own thing, and I have been in some, which have two toilet signs on each door which is even more confusing.As far as road signs are concerned my problem is that each time I look at a sign I read something totally different, but I think that's the illness playing its usual tricks. But it can cause confusion when my wife is driving and I try to read a sign.One thing I really hate is going into a hotel and finding it has a full length mirror on the wall, especially if the room stays fairly light at night, as you sometimes get up and see the reflexion of a door in the mirror and sometimes make the mistake of trying to walk into it.Others have very large mirrors in the bathroom so you see two of everything, and in one particular hotel it had a large vanity mirror on the wall behind the taps, and it was the following morning that I realised that I could see myself sat on the toilet which gave me quite a stir as I had not realised that it was there till I was sat minding my own business. It was quite off putting.Marble floors also cause upset as like many people I can sometimes see things which are not there. Its all due to the design, but some people think that we have a form of 3d vision, which allows the brain to think items are lurking in the design such as large worms, snakes or that we think there is a crevass in the floor when there is a different streak running across it.",

I then noticed and got involved with social media websites as a way of finding out more about my illness, Early Onset Lewy Body Dementia.Since then I have found many new friends who were doing the same thing, and we all share the information, on a regular basis.However this can cover a very large area and many websites, chat rooms and blogs.Blogging allows you to write down items about you and your illness, without expecting anyone to answer.Facebook is somewhere where we find teenagers etc, who are very interested in learning more about Grandfathers or Grandmothers illness, without being told by parents that its none of your business, or you simply don't understand.Twitter seems to a be far reaching web news website, where any news gets maximum coverage at the click of a button.While not everyone can benefit from social media as they simply were not diagnosed early enough, it is beneficial to many others. I was told to keep my brain active in the hope that it would not slow down, and although this is good advice it does not always work, as we all have good days and bad days, so its a case of doing what you can whileyou can.",

        "content": "Time to Raise Awareness of Dementia AgainDementia issomething that is difficult to understand and many General Practitioners don'treally understand it, let alone know how to diagnose it, and therefore we needto have more training in the dementia awareness campaign, but not just trainingfor doctors, but all medical staff, along with all those in the publicservices, police fire brigade and ambulance services, so they can understandthat when someone gets agitated in a strange like a hospital or an ambulance,it could be an illness like dementia and not something like drink or drugs.Dementiacovers a vast array of types of the illness, and as I was told by a consultantonce there are well over 120 variations of dementia, and no two people go down thesame route with the same symptoms, something which is difficult to grasp.How can thatwork, surely we need trained professionals trained within the NHS not inindustry as we see these days.We also needall care home staff to be given formal training, before they are given a job ina care home and I do think this is something that the National Institute forClinical Excellence should push for and make it mandatory, so there is noexcuse for abuse or mistreatment.Many of usalso do talks to trainee Nurses, Doctors and Social Workers at Universities andthis work must carry on if we are to succeed in getting this illness morerecognition, and also get standards raised, so they all understand what ourlives are live on a daily basis.People withdementia can have an important role in all of this, by going out and beingallowed to speak to staff in hospitals and care homes,It\u2019s not thefirst time we have spoken at an event.Training hasto get off the ground so that every only to be told afterwards that thestudents had learnt more from us than they did in a lecture. If that is thecase, \u201cwhere are the text books coming from\u201d, and are they up to date.We shouldensure that each person in a hospital or care home is treated with the samedignity and respect that we would all expect from other people and nothingshort of that will do. Anyone whodoes not understand that must be in the wrong job and should get out beforethey are thrown out.I am notalone with this, as many are not given the dignity and respect they deserve. In fact it\u2019stime that this was drilled into all staff including care home staff. TREATUS WITH THE SAME DIGNITY AND RESPECT THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM OTHERS. When we getthis message through we may start to get somewhere, as we hear far too manycases of people with this illness being abused in care homes and hospitalsthese days, something which in my view is a backward step not a forward one aswe would all expect in this centuryI know thatmoney is short in the health service, but to me it\u2019s spent on the wrong thingsby the wrong people, time and time again. I do thinkit\u2019s time to change the standards and bring back hospital Matrons, as they knowwhat\u2019s needed and are more in control than some pen pusher, who was brought into run the hospital, but has never done a day\u2019s work inside a proper hospital.

        "content": "Riskassessments in dementiaAs someone who used to write risk assessments etc., inindustry I often wonder how people can write risk assessment for a patient whohas dementia, because we never do the things others expect us to do. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to do certain things, it\u2019sbecause our brain is functioning in a different way to normal peoples brains,if I dare say normal people, because no one really knows what is normalWhen I was working I did assessments for every tradesman andcontractor in the college, yet now I find myself wondering how I could do anassessment on myself when the brain changes so much each day. Nothing is normal in this illness, and therefore nothingcan be taken for granted, as in normal people who carry on regardless.I was at a meeting once when a staff member was talkingabout writing risk assessments for people with dementia, and I vaguely rememberasking, how can you do such a thing when you had no idea what it's like to livewith the illness. This is something I really do not understand as peopleclaim to be able to write risk assessments for those who had this illness, yetthose of us who have the illness are capable of doing many different things,sometimes very silly things without thinking.My brain changes from hour to hour day to day, so how cansomeone tell me that they can write risk assessment for me, when I don't knowwhat I'm capable of in the next hour? When I was diagnosed with this illness I was told thingswould change sometimes on a daily basis, or an hourly basis, but I would haveto accept this and move on and not dwell on it, otherwise it could destroy me. However I was not aware that things have changed so muchor so fast. I had expected very slow changes, but nothing like this.KeepingFitWe're always being told that we should keep fit in anyway we can whether it be swimming, walking going to the gym or in some casesdancing. Yet many of the staff of these places are untrained toassess the ability of someone with dementia, and they don't really know what toexpect, if we fall over or lose our balance, something which can happen on aregular basis.I can no longer swim as I have lost my cool coordination,and I found that each time I moved my arms my mouth would open, so I ended upswallowing more water than enough. So I ended up giving up swimming before I drowned myself.I went to the gym, in the hope that this would help me tokeep fit, but soon found that there were problems there, because I could notwork or understand the treadmill. Aftercoming off the back of the machine three times, I was told to leave the gymbecause I was being a distraction and a menace to others in the area. This happened even though the instructor was warned thatI had dementia, but the sad fact was that this instructor had no idea about theillness, nor did she seem to care. After this I gave up the gym as a bad job so I started towalk, but there are times when I fall over when I lose my balance, but I am notgiving up just, to sit in a chair.I could get lost or disorientated, but then I can use atracking device, one of those things that officials hate, as it\u2019s against ourcivil liberties? It\u2019s against our civil liberties to be kept away fromtechnology which can assist us to live a life without being followed by ourcaregivers and families 24 hours a day, and If it gives us the freedom to do our own thingwhen we want to, then it has to be a good thing. Officials use technology each and every day, so whyshould it be wrong for us to use it and good for them to use it.Anyway if my wifewanted to track me on our computer, with one of those things that\u2019s up to her,it does not bother me, because if she is happy knowing that I am safe, thenthat\u2019s all that matters.WrongwordsWhy is it that I can slowly write things out, yet when itcomes to talking or doing speeches I cannot see the words in front of me ordon't recognize them. This does not make sense to me in the slightest and attimes it is very distressing. Surely if I write the words out I should recognize themwhen trying to read them, it makes no sense at all that I write all this stuff,and yet when I read back I don't always understand what I was trying to get at,and sometimes, see some very bad mistakes in spelling and grammar.I was always proud of my spelling and English grammar atschool now it\u2019s all goneSometimes the wrong words that come out which can beembarrassing or in some cases upsetting either to myself or those around me,it's not deliberate it just happens, so how do you make allowances for thiswhen you don't know it's going to happen in the first place. There are times I make a joke of it saying that my mouthis not in gear with my brain, but it's still hurtful and very upsetting when ithappens because it's not deliberate.Thensome smart Alec says, that I am being rude about those with dementia!, why becauseI am making fun of myself, rather than get upset and burst into tearsEarly on in the diagnosis I noticed that road signs wouldchange quite a lot or so I thought, then I realised that the signs were notchanging it was my brain telling me the sign said one thing one moment, andthen something else the second time round. I have the same problem with letters and e-mails becauseeach time I read them I get a different answer and a totally different meaning,but this is because the brain is misinterpreting them each time, so I end upleaving it all to my wife to read then we get the right-answer. This usually leads to more discussion about whether mywife's version was right, or whether mine was right.I just don't understand why the brain plays all of thesetricks on us.NoiseIf I am sat in a room with people I don't alwaysunderstand what is being said to me, and sometimes it's difficult to work outwhether someone is talking to me because to voice seems to be disjointed andremote. When I'm in a room full of people and someone stops justto speak, I find it extremely difficult to understand what that person issaying to me, as I can often hear other people speaking over the top. This sometimes leads me to stand with one finger in oneear to keep the noise down, or I turn my head so that my ear is facing theperson that speaking to me. I then have to explain that I am listening, but amhaving trouble tuning in to what you're saying, and not being rude. Sometimes in busy rooms the noise can be unbearable, andit often feels as if they're all 100 voices talking to me at the same time andbecomes very unnerving, and in some cases frightening.I do have hearing aids which help with this situation,but sometimes it's difficult in a busy room if there is no hearing loop, so Itend to leave them out.Revolvingdoors and escalators can be a nightmare to people with thisillness, and when it comes to revolving doors I won't go there.I simply will notwalk through one of those things unless my wife is my side as I cannot alwaysjudge the right time to step inside. Escalators are difficult but can be got round, as Isimply wait for the right time to step on although this can be very difficultin places like London, when it seems that everyone is behind me and they allwant to go down or up at the same time.CrossingroadsWhy is it when I'm crossing the road I'm not sure whetherthe car I can see, is close or further away than my brain is telling me. I have been caught out on many occasions when I steppedout onto the road only to find that the vehiclewas very close indeed, meaning that I didn't move fast I was going to beknocked down. This often leads to drivers getting annoyed at me as ifI'd done it on purpose.Judging distances and speed is when you have this illnessis a disaster waiting to happen, because the brain is telling us somethingwhich is not real or is difficult to understand.LosingitemsWe all lose things in our lives within this illness we'realways putting things down and forgetting where we put them, on this leads toutter frustration because you always find the item later on in a place thatyou've never looked, or on many occasions it was right under your nose in themost obvious place. .Verybad dreams and nightmaresHow do you do an assessment for someone who has very baddreams or nightmares, something which is part of Lewy Body dementia andParkinson's disease? I have very few nights when I sleep through without theseproblems and some are so graphic that I can explain all about the following dayin quite a lot of detail. So in a situation like this how do you cope with this asfar as taking the risk is concerned? You cannot fasten them down, as this would be classed asabuse. You cannot drug them otherwise they may not be able to wake up fromthese horrors and possibly risk a heart attack.On this occasion it all comes down to proper training ofthe illness, taking on board the problems which may or may not happen. But wemust remember that each person with dementia is vastly different to the nextperson, and each will experience different symptoms and problems. So one size does not fit all, and it cannot fit all. So assessments of the illness must be open and farreaching as writing an assessment for one person certainly would not fit thenext, and you cannot be forced to do something when you have this illnessotherwise it becomes cruelty and or abuse.There are many things which happen, but are not down here,simply because I cannot remember them all when writing, but allowances must bemade for every item which may happen at some stage. As I have just said I cannot remember quite a few of myproblems so how can someone write an assessment, if I cannot tell them what mayor may not happenSo when you look at all of this how it is possible forsomeone to do the risk assessment on the person with dementia, when we reallyhaven't a clue what we are capable of in the next few minutes or hours or days.Many people say, people with dementia get very agitated,but surely this is because things are not working out the way they should or gothe way we expect them to, and it's down to pure frustration although it mightcome out as aggression or agitation. Most people make mistakes in life and get away with it,but for some sad reason this never happens when the person cause dementia.Let\u2019sbe open and honest here, Risk Assessments are in many cases just more RED TAPEfor the officials in cosy offices. Doour caregivers write an assessment each day on what we are going to do? Nobecause they live with us 24/7 and they know that anything can and will happen,and they just have to try to keep us on the right track and pick up the pieceswhen we come off the rails. Thesepeople know more about the illness than the professionals because like us theyare living with it each and every day.Theyare not trained to do the job, and to be honest who would have that job,working 24/7 without pay and sometimes without the respect of the patient orpublic services.Butthey learn as they go, and do it with all of the love and affection they canmuster, even though they may be very tired and at times, at their wits end withworry about us, the ones with dementia, and the unpredictable ones.",

        "content": "I originally got involved with the Alzheimer's Society a few years ago,where I worked as an Ambassador, and then got involved with the Department ofHealth. My wife and I got involved with the National Dementia Strategy throughthe Society, and we were members of an Early Reference Group looking into earlydiagnosis and Intervention, and we are still actively involved with thestrategy where possible.I got involved as a Dignity Champion a few years ago, after listening topeople discussing the problems associated with dementia, while I was at anevent in Newcastle upon Tyne, and I was so fired up and annoyed by the lack ofdignity and care, that I decided to do more, and help out where I could. Duringthis time I have spent time trying to raise awareness about the lack of Dignityand Respect, when treating people who have this illness in care homes andGeneral Practice.During the last year I have spoken at events in North East Universitieswhere people are trained to do social work, as I feel that it is very importantto get in at an early stage and tell people how they should be treating peoplewith dementia. I also feel that by spelling out guidelines of how we would liketo be treated it is having an effect, as most people realise that we are notasking for the world but simply for things that most people take as normal.I think that many people shudder when we tell them how we want to betreated, as they then realise that there is something fundamentally wrong withthe training that many receive these days.Two years ago, I spoke at the Launch of the Living Well with Dementiaproject, which was held at Middlesbrough, and after talking about Dignity andRespect, a few people came up and asked if they could use my script in theirtraining at hospitals. This was something that I had not expected, but I didnot have to think twice about it, as I felt that it was very important, to getin at an early stage.Training people to understand the needs of those with this illness isnot as easy as it looks, as there are well over 120 variations of dementia, andwe are all different, so no two people have the same needs, but I have offeredto go and speak to anyone who is training people, so that they will get a betterunderstanding of what is needed, and how to treat people with dementia with thedignity and care they would expect from others.As it was pointed out at one event, those with the illness are in abetter position than GPs or consultants to tell others how we should be treatedbecause we are going through it on a daily basis. Through the Department ofHealth, I have also become a Mentor on Horsesmouth, as another way of helpingthose in need, as I can help those who may have just been diagnosed and don't knowwhere to go for help.There are many roles that a person with Dementia can do if given thesupport and help, and being a Dignity Champion is one of those, and I do feelthat I am helping many people to understand the needs of those with thisillness. There are many more people out there like me so why not allow us tohelp you, and also help ourselves.",

        "content": "Increasing user and carerinvolvement This is a priviage to be asked to come here today.Until I was diagnosed with thisillness I confess that I knew very little about it, in fact I had only everheard of Senile Dementia.Dementia is one of the worstdiseases I have heard of as your life is controlled others and once it takeshold life becomes a roller coaster, when we go from good days to days when eventhe simplest task can be very hard to work out let alone do. Sometimes a taskthat has been done many times in life becomes something alien and impossible todo. It also feels as if we losing all control, and I know from my ownexperience that I actually felt as if I was slowly going mad, because I couldnot understand what was happing to me.I had been a University CollegeEngineer in Oxford for 28 years, when I realised that something was drasticallywrong. In 2001 I had a very bad bout of Viral Pneumonia after which things werenever really the same. I had been responsible for all the services includingsetting up of two budgets, electrical planning, testing, design as well asestimates for the whole of the Building and Maintenance services. After a whilethings seemed to settle down and then over the Christmas period of that yearthings went from bad to worse. All myElectrical training was disappearing fast and I found that I could notunderstand how to do my estimates any longer, nor could I work out how I haddone them in the past. I had to use a Dictaphone at meetings etc. and to behonest I really thought that I was going mad because I could not find the wordsto explain what was happening. I had problems remembering mycomputer codes at work.I got lost going to work oneday. When I was diagnosed it came as aslight relief as I then knew what I had to cope with or at least I thought thatI did. I was unlucky enough to need two sets of diagnosis because when I wasdiagnosed first we lived in Oxford, and that was such a shambles that no onecould believe what had happened. In the end I had lost my job as a UniversityCollege Engineer, which I had held for 28 years along with my house, which wentwith the job. Then my mother died, and as thefamily home was empty it was suggested by my brother that we moved back up to theNorth East. It was then that I needed to be re-diagnosed as the Hospital inOxford seems to have lost my notes, but lucky for us we had brought a set ofletters with us from the Hospital which explained what had tests had been done.The re-diagnosis was done in a more relaxed way and was in many ways lessstressful and once this was complete I was offered treatment which had beendenied in Oxford. After about a year I had regainedcontrol over some of my life which was marvellous. I was very lucky that I realised that havingbeen given this second Diagnosis inDurham , that I had no alternative but to get on with life in whichever way Icould, and I had to get as much as I could out of that remaining time. It wasaround this time that I fully realised how lucky I was to have been given thismedication, as many people had never had the chance of even trying it, and thisI found extremely hard to accept. Yes I know that not all medicationworks but at least give people the chance of trying it to see. I felt at this time that there were many caseswhere money was being openly wasted in the NHS, and I felt that this wastageshould be tackled before cutting medication costs like this. The odd thing isthat I was told a few months ago that had I have been transferred to the nexthospital which specialised in this type of illness, not only would I have beengiven the medication straight away the chances were that I would have retainedmy job and would have paid taxes, something that this Government does not seemto want to know about. (This is the Post Code lottery for all its worth.)The Doctor at Durham gave us anotherlife line by suggesting that we went to our Local Branch of the Alzheimer\u2019sSociety where we would get extra help and support, but we never imaginedbecoming as involved as we did.It was this time that we realisedthat a lot of people were missing out on the medication and that reallysaddened me. This had been part of thereason that I decided to join the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, because we have to dosomething to help those who come along after us, we have to try to improveconditions in homes, raise awareness and where possible campaign for andsupport any improvements in medication.I also felt that being allowed to work with other people from diversebackgrounds, who have this disease, is in many ways, very interesting and ithelps us to feel as if we are still useful. What is more we found that we couldwork as a team to help others which was brilliant.I am extremely lucky that I have a veryunderstanding wife who has changed her life style to suite mine.Life can be hard at times becauseeverything changes so much and sometimes so fast.No two days are the same; in factthings change quite a lot over a day. I find that various problems canhave serious consequences on so days, and yet another day they have little orno effect.Reading articles these days causesproblems, because I can read the same thing 4 or 5times and see somethingdifferent each time, each with a different or slightly different meaning.Sometimes words are difficult tospell or understand.Noise plays a big part in my lifebecause my hearing has become more acute, and sometimes opening a bag of crispscan sound like an earth quake.Very bad and vivid nightmares. Sleeppatterns have changed. I sleep deeply during the daylight hours and yet atnight, I am very restless and wake up quite a lot. Since my diagnosis something hasreversed in my brain because I now find that my left hand is faster than myright, which used to be the other way round. This causes problems when using acomputer keyboard. Even my tastes have changed as I have now got to the stagewhere I enjoy things that I would never have gone anywhere near to years ago,and that is not that I did not try them.Trying to fathom out problems attimes varies from day to day, one day it\u2019s easy the next the same problem isimpossible to work out.I find it difficult in crowded areasbecause I feel as if I am being pulled over when people walk across in front ofme; this tends to make me feel unstable.Escalators cause problems, trying togauge the speed.Finding my way around strange roomsand areas can be difficult, especially modern buildings in which rooms, wallsand doors are all the same colour and design without breaks.I sometimes feel very unstable. As with many people who haveDementia, I can only concentrate for about 2 Hours at a time, after which I getvery tired. So people need to know that any meetings that are being plannedneed be structured to allow for breaks at certain times.It should also be remember thatmeetings should be as free of noise as possible. This is because it is difficult fora person with Dementia to tune into a voice when there are other noises in thebackground.We now need more respect anddignity for those with dementia as this can be done very simply.12Hints to help you communicate with someone who has dementia:-Try to stay CalmFace the person, speak clearly and slowlyMake sure that you have their attention by gentlytouching their arm and saying their nameUse short simple sentences and say exactly what you meanTry to get one idea across at a timeAllow plenty of time for the person to take in what yousay and to replyTry not to confuse or embarrass the person by correctingthem bluntlyUse questionswhich ask for a simple answerDon\u2019t ask questions which test their memory, e.g., who amI? Or what did you say yesterday.Talk about familiar people, places and ideasUse the surnames of the people you are talking about,instead of \u201che or she\u201d. It will remind the person of who you are talking about.Use facial expressions and hand gestures to make youunderstood.",

        "content": "We live in an age where Dementia is being moved forwardinto a new era, or so we hope. This illness has lived in the shadows for far too longand it\u2019s time to bring it back into the new age, removing the stigma and all ofthe other baggage that goes with it, and providing proper training for allworking in the Dementia Care field, whether it is volunteers or professionals. To do this we must ensure that all staff and volunteersare trained to understand what the illness is, and how to care for thoseunfortunate enough to have it.If we are lucky enough to be diagnosed at an early stage,we may well want to carry on enjoying our independence and freedom withoutbeing told what to do and without others following us round all of the time,and if this means using assistive technology so be it. I have heard many peoplesay that its wrong for people with dementia, to be using assistive technology.But why is it so wrong for us to use it when everyoneelse uses it on a daily basis and many people cannot be parted from it for onemoment.Many of us have hobbies that we enjoy doing, and weshould be encouraged to carry on with these while we can.It may not be easy looking after someone with theillness, no matter what stage the illness is at, but it\u2019s hard for those whohave it, as life is changing into something we don\u2019t want or recognise, letalone like.There are also many people who refuse to accept thediagnosis if they are lucky enough to get one, and carry on as if it\u2019s everyoneelse who has problemsIt\u2019s not just understanding the daily needs of someonewith this illness, our 24 hour needs, and sometimes the night time problems canbe horrific when you have nightmares and dreams, from hell, and there is no wayof getting away from them.We have spoken to many people in the last few years whohave been undergoing training in the medical field from Doctors, Nurses andcare staff, and they all come out with the same thing, we are all vastly undertrained to understand this illness.Sowhere do we start.People with dementia often feel vulnerable as their condition progressesand they increasingly rely on other people to do things for them. It\u2019snot just our hobbies and past times which change it\u2019s our way of life, what wedo, what we see or say. Caring for a pet cat or dog, can bring a lot of pleasure to some people, or if you are like a dear friend of mine andmyself, tropical fish can help in many ways. I know that you can\u2019t take themfor a walk, but watching them and looking after them is a tonic at times. If the person you care for was very sociable and outgoing or if theyhave a large family, they may really enjoy visits from one or two familymembers or friends. Remember, they may struggle to keep up with conversationsif they have a lot of visitors at the same time.We have to treat everyone with Dignity and respect, thesame respect that you would expect from others.Treating people with Dignity and respect is somethingthat is very easy to do, yet it is ignored because many people working in thecaring society think that they know better than we do, a common mistake becausewhether you like it or not we still have ears and a voice and can say things attimes without support. I also feel that we should start this by educationchildren, who are asking questions about their grandparents etc. who may havethe illness, then move on to making sure that all in the medical field, carehomes and voluntary sector are adequately trained. In fact anyone who comes into contact with people, who are unfortunate enough to have this illness, shouldbe trained to understand it. I remember going to a local doctors surgery to talk aboutthe illness alongside a branch manager from the Alzheimer\u2019s Society\u201d in thedays when the Society had such things locally\u201d and we were both of the opinionthat it was a complete and utter waste of time. Only two out of around 12people were interested, and both were from the Far East.The rest were slumped down in their chairs, looking as ifthey were totally bored, yet it was well known then that Dementia figures wouldrocket in the next few years.We were at a Young Doctors Training Event in Londongiving a talk, and after we had finished we were told by a young traineedoctor, that he had learnt more in half an hour than he had at his traininglectures, because it can from people with the knowledge of the illness, and nota text book lecture. The very same thing happened at a University where socialworkers were being trained, so I have to ask why this lecturer\u2019s rely on textbooks which talk about basic dementia, when there is in theory no such thing. There is no way you can lecture on this illness, in thetime allowed, possibly 10 hours if you are lucky, because this illness, coverssuch a vast field.There may well be less than 10 known types of dementia,but there are well over 120 variations of the illness. Which means that we willgo down a different route, with different symptoms and needs to the next person.I have a friend with Lewy Body dementia, and we are both vastlydifferent even though he frequently says otherwise.I cannot quote chapter and verse like him, as I struggleat times to remember what I did earlier or the day before.  I need time t take on board what has beensaid before I can come up with the correct answer. This can be stressful at times, and can at times end upwith things coming out the wrong way, which is embarrassing and distressing,especially if those around pick it up the wrong way and do not make allowancesfor the illness.So with this in mind we simply cannot train people tounderstand the illness, and expect one size to fit all, it just cannot work,and will not work because we are all vastly different individuals.Dementia care should by a specialist course on its own,and everyone who is going to work in this field should have recognised training,not just in what the illness is but how they can understand it, and what ourneeds may be.Many people write their own life stories in the hope thatwhen we go into hospital or care this can be used by staff to understand who weare and what we enjoy doing. In this way these same staff members may learnabout us and then with luck, they will treat us with the dignity and respectthat they would expect from others.Its also a very important document as it is there for ourfamilies when we have gone, so they can understand more about who we were andwhat we possibly did.I was once in the sad position when a trainee worker cameto our home, and they really did not have a clue about the illness, sheobviously thought that all people with dementia were deaf and stupid. Because she came right up to my face and shouted. I don\u2019tknow how I did not slap her because like it or not she had come into my safetyzone and done something that frightened me completely. Like many with thisillness, I am not violent, by when someone startles us like that it gets thewrong reaction, and we will get the blame.",

Why should thehealth service do the Councils work for them?As someone who was involved with the National DementiaStrategy, I thought we were going places and going fast, but every now and thenwe get the news people saying that wards in general hospitals are clogged upwith the elderly and those who have dementia, because there simply is nowhereelse for them to go.Surely it\u2019s time to get things reversed, and make eachcouncil look after its own elderly, rather than filling their own pockets, andleaving someone else to build care homes. The problems is that the care homesin the private sector are all big companies, and companies look for profit, andthey will make a profit anyway they can. To me it\u2019s another way of hittingthose already struggling to live with an illness, which is getting bigger bythe week.I think the Government should change things and change themfast, by making councils more responsible for those in their areas, and makingall moneys available for dementia care accountable, no matter where its beingspent. This in my own view and this money should also be ring fenced to ensurethat it is spent on the right things by the right people, and not as we haveseen in many places being used to prop up other services.All staff should be given the correct training in all carehomes to ensure that they know what they are doing irrespective of the costsinvolved. Lets be honest, a good care home which is run well with well trainedstaff always comes out on top, and people will respect the owners. ",

        "content": "These days we hear all about dementia champions etc., butnever much about the caring champions.Caring for anyone with an illness or serious injury canbe difficult and at times very hard to cope with. But when someone with dementia gets a diagnosis, it iscommonly sad the they family start to grieve as the person they are lookingafter will change in time, and will not be the same person they have grown upwith and loved.I confess that it\u2019s bad enough having the illness andtrying to cope with whatever life throws at you. But our caregivers mean so much to us, andhave so much to put up with over the years.Our caregivers are not just our partners in this illness,they are in many cases someone we married many years ago, and we agreed that wewould stay with them in sickness and in health, until death us do part, as saidin the marriage vows. Yet thinking about it now, I know that I may look likethe same person Janice married years ago in 1972, but when I stand up to dosomething or same something, I become a vastly different person. As my dearwife has said on many occasions, I am not the person she married all of thoseyears ago.But having said that I confess that I cannot get near toimagine, what she goes through on a daily basis. Her role as my carer or care giver has changed from theone she was used to, and that was being my loving wife. Yes she still is myloving wife, and I would not change her for anything in the world, nor could Ido without her as she is my rock and support when the wheels come off. But herrole has changed so much, and it hurts me at times This illness has changed me in many ways, the way I think,and my personality have all changed since the diagnosis. Yes a person withdementia looks quite normal from the outside, but we have changed inwardly, andsometimes we don\u2019t appreciate or understand these changes. It\u2019s as if the brainis now controlling me rather than the other way round.For years I was my own person and proud of it, I did notneed to be protected nor did I want people telling me how to do things, ordoing it for me. I was an engineer and did estimating, costing, writingreports, as well as doing budgets, yet that is all but a mere memory, and thesedays its very confusing looking at figures and letters, trying to understandwhat things mean.Yes I did what I wanted to do, the way I wanted, but now,I have to work things to suite others and that can be upsetting. I was secure and felt strong, yet now I feel veryinsecure at times.Now I find myself more and more dependent on others inthe family, and that includes my big champion my dear wife.As prominent person with dementia in America (Dr RichardTaylor) once said, I am not sure whether my wife is my champion or my hero. Heroes are shared with others. Champions are more personal.Heroes are worshipped from afar. Where champions generally embrace the values and feelingsof those they champion. With heroes is usually the other way around. So perhaps in many ways Janice is my personal champion,and that means quite a lot to me.These people are our personal champions, our Hero\u2019salthough we normally speak of Hero\u2019s being someone who is shared by manypeople, but I do think my wife is my Champion as she cares for me, and helps mefeel more secure, no matter where I am, and like others she looks out for me allthe way through the illness, and supports me when I get stuck. They are sometimes our personal driverOur personal SecretaryOur advisorOur travel booking agency, and travel companionOur personal nurse who sorts out our daily care andmedicationOur personal handy person, when we forget what we need todo.Our Gardener when we are unsurePersonal Cheerleader, yes because without them constantlysaying we are doing fine, we would simply give up. My Financial managerMy SpokesmanWhen I am attempting to write a talk, she usually checksit and edits it, because my brain goes faster than my hands, and I end upmissing words out, or sections just seem to disappear and things don\u2019t soundright.Janice sorts out the washing machine that is toodifficult to work out, and iron our clothes so that we look clean and tidy whenwe go out. I use to enjoy ironing but now, I get the creases in thewrong place most of the time Theses loving people must get frustrated by us asking thesame questions over and over again. Do they trust us to do anything without making a total pig\u2019sear of it?Janice has protected me throughout, but allows me to dowhat I want, within reason, in the hope, that I will realise what it\u2019s time tohang up my boots and stop doing certain things. It\u2019s a very slow and hardprocess doing this.It\u2019s very hard to accept defeat or ask for help, and Iguess that\u2019s just a man thing, Never Admit to being unable to do anything, asit makes us look foolish. But to be honest I feel we are only fooling ourselves,and there comes a time when we have to say enough is enough.Everyday has to be a drain on her, as we are no longerthe team we were, working together to build a good life for us both and when weworked together to achieve our aims, now she has to do most of this workherself, because she usually ends up correcting the things I have attempted todo on my own. I am now more dependent on Janice than I ever dreamt of,and if anything were to happen to her tomorrow the world would all end for me.A few years ago she fell and broke her ankle, so I was upgradedto chief, cleaner shopper and driver. I don\u2019t usually go near to the car thesedays unless she is there, even though I have driven thousands of mile in mylife, I no longer feel quite at home in the car any more and won\u2019t get in todrive unless she is with me.But I could not have done the shopping without her beingon the end of the mobile phone. Where is this usually found, what kind of thisor that do we use, and what does it look like, all of which must have drivenher up the wall. It was a terrific drain on me, let alone poor Janice, but inthat instance our roles had changed.But when you have an illness like this, shops become anightmare place where we don\u2019t like being, because some buffoon keeps movingthe shelves and their contents around just to confuse us. As well as negotiating all of the different aisles withthousands of things on, and we are trying to work out where each item is, wealso have to watch for all of the mad high speed idiots with the trolleys, therows of storage trolleys waiting to be unloaded, as well as the staff who nowpull full trolleys towards you while walking backwards. It\u2019s all mind blowingto us and very confusing.So yes I would be lost without my personal champion ",

I was and engineer for thirtyyears when I was diagnosed with early onset Lewy Body Dementia, and lost my jobbecause I was classed as unsafe to do it. However like many when thisillness is diagnosed I was not given the chance to do a reasonable job but wasoffered either a cleaning job or retirement. After all of my time working Ifelt a little insulted by this offer. But looking back I do feelthat many employers would do exactly the same, and whether we like it or notthere are not many jobs that we could do on a regular basis and do it properlyevery time.We may turn up and notremember what we are supposed to be doing or where we are supposed to be going,and not many if any employers would allow that to happen.I may have forgotten much ofmy job, but occasionally some of it comes back, and although I have tried to dosome jobs at home one time or another, I tend to steer clear of anything thatcould be classed as dangerous. However many of these smalljobs fail and I am left feeling distressed.So why someone, with dementiaor any other long time illness should, be penalised by the government agencies,or anyone else for that matter.Yes I occasionally dospeaking events where I talk about dementia for about quarter of an hour, butthe notes are always written out in very large letters so I don't forget what Iam trying to say. Half of the time I may getlost unless my finger follows each letter, and sometimes I lose track, but Icould not do that all day and every day as it is very tiring.There are many otherNeurological illness like dementia where people are being penalised, and I dofeel that to the government departments and the press we are easy targets,because they think we may not fight back, but I am not frightened of some overpaid civil servant or reporter who thinks that we should not be on benefits.Unlike these people we don'tget out of bed knowing that everything is going to be cosy all day, and at theend of our working life we will be on a fat pension. Many of us had to retireearly and therefore lost many years on our pensions.When I look at thegovernments these days and all of those who hang around Whitehall etc., I don'tthink that they have any idea what this illness is and many don't really care. We hear the occasional speechabout the illness and nothing much happens after that, and I say that because it\u2019sa few years since the launch of the National Dementia Strategy, and I don'tthink that much has changed because the government did not force the doctorsand hospitals to do anything, so many sat back took the money and let thegovernment carry on talking.These people have the powerto acknowledge our problem and make a case for us yet they simply don't listen.The other day some idiot wastalking about those in the Paralympics and the benefits they receive, sayingthat if they were fit enough to do sport, they should not have benefits, Iconfess that this really hurt and could not understand how anyone could everthink about saying these things .Yes there are many people outthere in this country taking benefits, even though there is nothing wrong withthem, but when they are caught are they penalised. NOIt\u2019s my firm view that ifsomeone is caught cheating the system they should by law be made to repayeverything, and not just give them a slapped wrist, because as we all knowthese people did this on their own and knew what they were doing.",

        "content": "\u00b7It\u2019s time to raise awareness ofdementia again, although some of us are always raising awareness in thebackground for years, without a lot of publicity, but many of us do it to helpthose who cannot help themselves, and we want things to improve in the future.I have never done this for personal gain or publicity as it is a very emotionalsubject, and to be honest, I would rather not know about the illness in thefirst place, but would prefer it to be something from the past, but I am stuckwith it and have to get on with life as best I can.Dementia has taken over as the disease that no one wants like Cancer was in theSixty's the \"BIG C\" as it was called and no one would talk about itas if it was a dirty disease.But like dementia no one asked for it and in most cases we don't know whatcauses it, and until we find out the causes, there will be no cure for it.I have Lewy Body Dementia, and often wondered if I got something from workingon live electrical circuits as part of my job. It was not the best place to bewith your hands inside a live electrical distribution board with your head justoutside watching what you were doing, and it certainly was not a safe orhealthy job.But I enjoyed doing it all hours of the day, and would not have changed it, untilthis illness kicked in.Dementia covers a vast array of types of the illness, and as I was told by aconsultant once there are well over 120 variations of dementia, and no twopeople go down the same route with the same symptoms, something which is difficultto grasp.Many people had only ever heard of Senile dementia, but those day are longgone, where people with the illness where put in wards out of sight, as manythought they were simply mad.This is something that I find very hard to grasp. Yes we have bad times and wecannot control what happens, but we are certainly not mad, it\u2019s just our brainis doing things its own way and making us do things that we would not normallydo.Dementia is something that is difficult to understand and many General Practitionersdon't really understand it, let alone know how to diagnose it, and therefore weneed to have more training in the dementia awareness campaign, but not justtraining for doctors, but all medical staff, along with all those in the publicservices, police fire brigade and ambulance services, so they can understandthat when someone gets agitated in a strange like a hospital or an ambulance,it could be an illness like dementia and not something like drink or drugs.Dementia is a horrible illness, and there have been days when I honestly wishedit would all just end, as it gets distressing losing control of your life thisway. But like other illness in the early to mid-stages, we have good days andgrim days, but the thought of what\u2019s around the corner terrifies me, and Idon't want to think about it. Of cause dementia can also be made worse when weget things like infections or other illness, so life is anything but straightforward.I am not frightened of dying, but I am terrified of losing my dignity andcontrol of my life.I am not alone with this, as many are not given the dignity and respect theydeserve. In fact it\u2019s time that this was drilled into all staff including carehome staff.TREAT US WITH THE SAME DIGNITY AND RESPECT THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM OTHERS.If you cannot do that than you\u2019re in the wrong jobWhen we get this message through we may start to get somewhere,as we hear far too many cases of people with this illness being abused in carehomes and hospitals these days, something which in my view is a backward stepnot a forward one as we would all expect in this centuryWe see articles in the news press each day, about dementia, but there isnothing positive it\u2019s all negative articles about abuse etc. This week howeverwas pretty good, as we heard that at least one hospital in the UK is setting updementia friendly wards, with dedicated staff, something which is brilliant andwell over due.I know that money is short in the health service, but to me it\u2019s spent on thewrong things by the wrong people, time and time again.I do think it\u2019s time to change the standards and bring back hospital Matrons,as they know what\u2019s needed and are more in control than some pen pusher, whowas brought in to run the hospital, but has never done a day\u2019s work inside aproper hospital.How can that work, surely we need trained professionals trained within the NHSnot in industry as we see these days.We also need all care home staff to be given formal training, before they aregiven a job in a care home and I do think this is something that the NationalInstitute for Clinical Excellence should push for and make it mandatory, sothere is no excuse for abuse or mistreatment.People with dementia can have an important role in all of this, by going outand being allowed to speak to staff in hospitals and care homes,Many of us also do this, along with talking to trainee Nurses and SocialWorkers at Universities, and this work must carry on if we are to succeed ingetting this illness more recognition, and also get standards raised, so theyall understand what our lives are live on a daily basis.It\u2019s all well and good campaigning in newspapers, but to be honest who manypeople reading papers, actually read articles about dementia. Along with theTelevision companies don't cover dementia, very much as it\u2019s not a very sexysubject to cover, so it\u2019s hit and miss when they actually show anything aboutdementia unless it\u2019s about abuse.So let\u2019s all start campaigning in the hope that lives will be changed over thenext few years and dementia will get better press coverage, and also with a bitof luck some new medications which will either help us live longer or cure thusillness.

I stopped going to a lot of meetings which were, not kept incontrol by a strong chairperson, because it was becoming very difficult tolisten to the main topic while others chatted among themselves, as well as themobile phones which kept going off, because people would not switch them tosilent. The problem we struggle with is concentration, and while trying to keepour concentration going on the main topic, it does not take much noise to breakthis and we have to think where we were all over again.I accept that life is very busy for most people these days, butits no different to when I was working and mobile phones were not allowed inmeetings. It seems very strange that many people did not have these items tillthe last twenty years, now it seems that many will not go anywhere without oneof these things firmly clamped to their ears, whether in the street, in ameeting or travelling on a train, and you have to listen to their exploits fromthat day or the night before, which to me is embarrassing but it means nothingto that person them selves.Yesterday I went with my wife to book a holiday, and found thatthe noise in the Travel agents was so horrific that I removed my hearing aids,as every one's voice was merging into one , just like one of my horriblenightmares, and I had to leave all the decisions to my wife, who by this stagein life is used to it.But I often wonder why it is that people these days have tospeak to loud, and don't think of trying to speak quietly so they are notdisrupting other peoples conversations or in our case \"our thoughts\".It seems we are all trying to out do each other. The same thing happens when we go shopping and it seems thateach shop has loud music being pumped out of the doors, so by the time you getinto the shop you can not think. I know that at work we had regulations concerningthe noise from machines etc, yet there does not seem to be anything coveringworking in shops when they have loud music. Another thing which seems to get me wound up is when we go intoa supermarket, and someone keeps shouting over a tannoy system, and repeatsthemselves three or four times by which time, I have forgotten what I amlooking for. These places are becoming a nightmare to me, and I am starting tohate them, either because of the tannoy systems or the mad idiots with thetrolleys who go hurtling round the aisles as if they were racing.Or is it the fact that through my Lewy Body Dementia, my brainthese days is now struggling to pick up sounds, and some sounds are much arelouder that others.I wish my blog could write this out without all of the mistakesand misspellings I keep finding, but at least I can still use spell check whenI remember to use it.",

        "content": "Words don\u2019t come as easy as they used toI have realised that overthe last week things have been harder to do than ever before, and it gets verydistressing when you realise this is happening, and wonder just how long it cango on before, I stop doing as much and give in.I have made quite a fewmistakes this week by using the wrong words, and it caused some distress bothto my wife and to myself, when I realised what had happened. I know that wordsdon\u2019t come out the way they used, to and whether the brain is trying to go toofast for me, or I am trying to go too fast for my brain, I really don\u2019t know. Iknow that when I am using the keyboard I am trying to write it everything downbefore I forget what I am trying to say, so perhaps its just the brain hasslowed down so much that its difficult to come to terms with.While I was talking to thestudent nurses the other day, I made a mistake, and used the wrong word on oneoccasion, something that my wife pointed out later, although it was not rude ornasty, it could have been picked up the wrong way by some, and I was upsetabout it.This was because I writethe talk out in size 14 letters on the computer, and this takes about a week orsometimes two to complete, made worse sometimes because I sometimes repeatthings I have already written down, yet I did not notice until my wife pointedit out. But on the day I don\u2019talways see all the words that are written down in front of me. This has been noticed on afew occasions when I get an e-mail and don\u2019t always understand what it meansuntil I have read it a few times. The problem is that eachtime I read something, I see something different each time and it getsdistressing, when you don\u2019t understand something or totally misread it, and itsonly when my wife reads the same thing that I realise I have picked it up thewrong way, and sometimes gets a totally different meaning to what was meant.There are times like thiswhen I really hate this illness, as it destroys your ability to control yourlife, and where assistive technology helps to write things on the computer, itdoes not help with speech or trying to get the correct words out.When I look back to my daysat school and at college, we were always taught how to speak clearly and usethe correct words, and when I was at work as an engineer, I could write reportsin half an hour to an hour without thinking, now that has all changed so much. Simple things like typinghave become a nightmare, because although I have always been right-handed, Ihave now found that my left hand is faster than my right hand so I end upsitting on one hand to get the spelling right, otherwise the letters of theword are all mixed up, and although the letters of the word are all there theyare all jumbled up, which looks more like a code than a letter or e-mail. When this first happened itwas very distressing and hard to cope with, but through using voice activatedsoftware like the Dragon I have been able to get around some of the problems,and life has become easier. The problem with usingvoice activated software is that people think you're talking to yourself, whenin fact you're talking to the computer which is a rather strange especiallywhen you see the words being written out in front of you without touching the keyboard.It is times like this whenI realise how easy it is for other people to be misunderstood in hospitals andcare homes etc, and then be treated with lack of respect because the staffthought they were rude, just because they made a simple mistake and used thewrong word or words, something which is taken for granted by those who havenormal brains, and yet those with this illness are treated like idiots.I guess this is a steeplearning curve for myself and my poor wife, because although I struggle andlose it at times, she must find it very distressing to see, knowing full wellthat before much longer I will not be as active as I am today.Byusing this blog I can explain my life, my problems with dementia and my effortsto get around the problems I find it life. Iconfess that not everyone can understand or react the way I do, as they may bein the mid to later stages of illness, and that is something which will come tome eventually, and I confess I am not looking forward to it, but as we all knoweventually these illnesses catch up with you, and dementia is hard for everyoneto cope with, from a wives and loved ones to our extended family and friends. Aswe know this illness affects not only those with this illness but those around,and is not something that anyone wants, because as we know there is no cure,the medication only slows it down enough for us to enjoy life a bit longer andperhaps see things we would never have expected to see, like my lovelygrandchildren.Although this blog can bepainful at times, it helps me to understand that there are other people outthere around the world who are in need of advice, or perhaps need to understandmore about the illness, so perhaps by doing this blog, I am not only helpingmyself but then I am helping many others. So this gives meencouragement to carry on and try to explain my life my problems, and wherepossible my successes in beating this illness although I confess that there aremore bad days which seem to overshadow the good days.The amazing thing is thatthe blog is now read in 63 countries, and although, I don't see who is readingthis, it is encouraging me to carry on for a while longer, and I would love tohear from others.",

From our station you can see a large viaduct which was built in theearly 1900s.The train left the platform got halfway over the viaduct, when it allcollapsed taking the train with it, in full view of all standing on theplatform. I have never even thought of this before, but I woke up and to this verymoment I can still remember every detail about what happened, yet other thingsI have done today have gone from my memory.After waking up I settled down and had another horrible dream but the wassoon forgotten when I got up yet the first one is still fresh in my mindtonight.I confess that this is distressing when it happens and usually takes a dayor two before it all starts to drift away, sometimes longer.

When I look at all of this I am not sure whether stigma isthe right word, I rather think that it should be more like discriminatedagainst, just like third class citizens.When we consider that 20 years ago cancer was still a dirty word which wasstigmatised, and people who had it were treated as if they had a dirty sexualdisease, thankfully this has now changed. Dementia on the other hand was always treated in many places as madness andI do not think it has changed to day in a lot of places, but this is due tolack of understanding by the general public and lack of leadership by thegovernment and some of the medical profession. These poor people who have this horrendous illness are the victims and aretreated like old day lepers by Society. The stigma attached to this illness isunreal and unacceptable in this day and age. We are dealing with an illnesswhich is not self inflicted or asked for and yet it seems that some of today\u2019ssociety treat us as if we had an infectious disease. It does not help when support is removed from the one place one should getit from and that is this Government, who created (NICE ) National Institute forClinical Excellence which was set up by the government. There are few drugstoday which can help, if anything they can slow the progress of the illness butnot stop it, and yet they have been stopped for the early stages of the diseasewhich is when they are needed. The fact that these drugs slow the illness down is something in this day andage and yet NICE are trying to rubbish the results by saying they do not workand are not cost effective. Does Aspirin work for everyone, No it does not. But this government set up NICE to save money no matter what theconsequences were and that is immoral and unjust. Not only have these peoplegot a disease which is in thinkable, many lost their jobs through it andsometimes like myself they lost their homes which went with the jobs. We allpaid our taxes for years and our National Insurance which the government set upto protect us when we got older, but never once said that we would be left withnothing if we got Dementia. We also have Members of Parliament who have sent out letters saying the evenif the government tried to overturn the NICE decision they would never back theGovernment. When you look at this it is not just the Dementia patients who aresuffering but all illnesses including cancer. No one can get medicationanymore. We therefore need to get rid of this stigma from the top down over andlike it or not the worse offenders are the government themselves. We need to re-educate the nation about the illness so that everyone knowsthat we are normal people who had the misfortune to get an illness which closesthe brain down. Once we have achieved this people who have Dementia will startto admit that they have it, and talk about it rather than try to hide it. We also need to get better services in England so that we get the sametreatment and services as the other parts of the UK, and not less as we arenow. Not only that, but the people who look after us, and care for us are treatedwith little or no respect by the government. Care homes are now so expensivethat our carers are expected to look after us at home with little or no helpfrom the government services. We are left to support from charities who havebeen short changed the by government as well and now find it increasinglydifficult to find funds to keep going.Sadly now people who self inflict are more liable to get better treatmentthan those who are inflicted with a brain disorder such as Alzheimer's orDementia. The costs of smoking and drink problems are something which is on the riseat a rapid rate and yet nothing is done to stop it. Drug problems are the same,as well as this we now have a problem with obesity which is likely to getworse.",

I suppose this all goes back tomy time as an Engineer when I spent hours on end looking for faults andcorrecting them, now it takes me days or sometimes weeks to find or rememberwhat I am looking for.I know that in time I will stop looking at problems, and will end up withsomeone else finding and correcting them, but at present it simply does nothelp me.society, who say that we should be helping ourselves more or that we aredoing the wrong things in life.I was very active at work and led a busy life, which was enjoyable, I workedall hours of the day and at times night, so much so I never had time to thinkabout being depressed or fed up.However the first thing a doctor says these days when a person with memoryproblems go to see them is, that they are depressed. HOW CAN THIS BE. Can they not look beyond that and look at what is causing the so calleddepression, something like, I can not remember how to do my job, or why did Iget lost going to work today, why can I not remember my computer log on codes,where are my keys, I have forgotten that persons name and that is embarrassing.It seems very strange that everyone is labeled with being depressed withoutlooking for the cause behind it, and this has happened to many people some ofwho have been put on anti depressants and then taken off when the GP realisesthat it is not depression after all but dementia. But they never say that theygot it wrong do they, its always your fault.Perhaps these people need more training after all to ensure that they knowwhat they are doing, and stop destroying other peoples lives.I always say live life to the full, while you can, don't over do anything,but do it in moderation.

This disease has taken over the role Cancer had in the 1950-60 as the mostfeared disease in the face of the earth, as there is no cure, or universal wayof slowing it down.We also see carers, who are seeing, perhaps someone you married many yearsago, changing in front of your eyes, and knowing that before many years havepassed, that person will no longer be able to recognise you anymore, speak ordo anything for themselves. However we are seeing the new National Dementia Strategy unfolding aroundthe country, and starting to see how its changes are affecting peoples lives insome places and how long awaited improvements are being made in others. Thousands of people with this illness, carers along with families andfriends have waited for this for some time, and are eager to see it workingproperly for the benefit of all concerned.The changes are immense but sadly it all depends on the local PCTs to makesure that it works and works well, but we all have input and it is down to usto ensure that the patients word is heard along with the carers.However, although the strategy goes a long to help, we should also belooking how we can start to re-train people, in an effort to change the cultureand education, as far as dementia is concerned, so that everyone understands whatit is like to live with the illness, and how they can cope with them in abetter and understanding way.A lot could be achieved by training staff, to treat people with dementia,with the respect and dignity they deserve, because dementia is a journey, whichis taken not just by the person with the illness, but also their carers, familyand loved ones. We hear a lot about problems when someone is admitted to hospital or anursing home, and this is usually made worse by the fact that neither, thenursing staff or the doctors understand that the person has dementia, or whatdementia is. Sadly, this is lack of training, and this has to be looked intobefore things can get better.I also hope that the training goes even further, and we stop hearing thehorror stories, about people in the later stages being treated badly byuntrained staff. In this day and age we should be having all staff beingtrained properly, so they understand what it may be like to have this horribleillness, and we should be paying them to do the job properly.",

Shortly after thisI heard that my daughter was pregnant and after three miscarriages was going tohave her first child. We now have three wonderful grandchildren which iswonderful, so I have an extra reason to complete this story as I would like toshare this with them given the chance. Originally I was told to write this story before I was given any medicationso I never expected to get as far as I did, but it took my mind off the futureall together.I have now been invited to join the National Board of the Life Story Networklast week, to help them roll out the new training programme which they hopewill help train care workers and health staff, to encourage people withdementia etc, to write a short life story about themselves.These stories will help carers (or Care Givers ) and care staff tounderstand who they are looking after, and what these people did in life, suchas where they were born, where they lived, who they married and who theirchildren and grandchildren are, along with their past times hobbies, likes anddislikes. This will in the end give them a clear picture of who they arelooking after. These stories will need a lot of research to ensure that only the requiredparts of the person life are recorded and used, and anything which is hurtfulor very personal will not be touched.So when I was invited to join the Board, I jumped at the chance as I thoughtI had to do something to help them, with this training programme and tell themanything that stuck out as wrong or offensive or \u201cpatronising\" to others Ihave met. But everything was so well organised and planned that I could findnothing wrong at any stage, and was truly amazed at all of the hard work thathad been done. It is very interesting working with this group, as everyone as everyone wasupbeat and this was one of those meetings, where there were no negativethoughts, so I left feeling that I had achieved something positive.To do this they are using a chest of 3 drawers as the method.The top drawer is items that they will share willingly with anyone,and don't mind it being out in the openThe Middle or second drawer is the items that they will only sharewith close family as it is a little sensitive, and this should not be lookedat, unless the person allows it.The bottom or third drawer is used for items which should not bediscussed at any cost.This training has to be done properly as many like myself had problems inlife that were hard to come to terms with, and I would not want to go overthese again as they were too painful, and without my dear wife I would neverhave got that far. I say that because when the first thing happened I was young and had no oneI felt able to talk to, yet I had done nothing wrong, but had been wronged, bysomeone close to the family, and I knew at the time that they would be believedrather than myself, and it was a horrible time.It was only when I met my wife and got married that this came out, and sheunderstood just how I felt.So with this in mine we have to consider others who could be in the sameboat.We must treat the person with the dignity and respect that we would expectfrom others.Since starting my life story it has taken on astronomic proportions, as Ikept remembering things that were said by my family and relatives.

Many people like myself can sleep quite deeply for half an hour during theday, sometimes after lunch, but night times it can be a hazard as I have foundto my horror on many occasions.I have tried going to sleep listening to classic music when I go to bed,which I listen to through headphones. Sometimes that works, providing themusic is fairly slow and not lively, otherwise I get into trouble for waking mywife up. Lively music can also keep the mind active so you can not sleep asgood as normal.If this fails the nightmares can be severe and can end up with someonegetting hurt, and that can be even more distressing for me, as it all happenswithout my knowledge. I now sleep with all breakables well out of reach as aprecaution.No one seems to understand what causes these horrible nightmares, and Ipersonally do not want to take a tranquilizer, as I find that I need to get outof these as soon as I can. It was suggested that I took a new tablet at night time, but that madethings so much worse, and I have a fear that if I take a tranquilizer I may notbe able to wake up, and break free of this horror.The main problem with these nightmares is that sometimes they stop when Iwake up, when other times, they can go on while I am awake and then start allover again when I try to sleep, and this can cause me to get out of bed intotal fear as I can not get away from it, no matter how I try.This leaves me in a state of exhaustion, as I am tired but at the same timetoo frightened to attempt to go to sleep, so that in turn adds more problems tomy cognitive problems, so this is quite a vicious circle.I do feel sorry for everyone else who has these problems as there feels asif there is no way out of this situation.I have also tried hot chocolate etc before going to bed in the hope ofstopping this but that does not seem to work either, so I live in hope thatsooner or later the medical profession will come up with a remedy.I do wonder just how many people go into these nightmares and have a heartattack, as they can be so horrific and you can not get out of them.",

This gave me a new start tolife again as I already knew the neighbours at the family home and they werevery supportive. After needing to be diagnosed again I was given the medicationthat had been refused in the first hospital, although to be honest I really didnot expect it to work.Since being given the medication on 2004 I have managed to get my life back,and I am now enjoying myself doing all the things that would have beenimpossible before the medication.

Little did Iknow that each government department is doing its level best to reinvent thewheel and have its own guidelines for everything including the way people withdementia are looked at and treated? Some departments don\u2019t think assistive technology is a goodthing in dementia, yet many of us rely on it to get us through the day.The National dementia strategy was worked on by people fromevery background, and also included many people with dementia and carers ineach section of the project, so that everyone\u2019s view was taken on board andaccepted, not just the views of the so called professionals working in the NHSwho think that they know it all, or the Civil Servants, who think they knoweverything and everyone else is stupid.This was a democratic process where everyone shared theiropinions, but at the same time accepted other people\u2019s views, as like it or notin a case like dementia, unless you have the illness, are caring for someonewho has it, or have seen it in the family, what real experience do you reallyhave in discussing it. I get the firm idea that these civil servants will notaccept anything written down which either they were not involved with, or thefact that the item is not written out in civil service jargon, like lawyersthey use language which no one understands.Surely the best way to discuss a health project like Canceror Dementia is to have real people on the panel, and by that I mean people whoreally know what it\u2019s like to have or see up close someone who has the illness.I find it distressing listening to health professionals and all of theirjargon, using and changing words just to suite these selves, rather than havesomething that can be understood by everyone.I know what it is like living with this horrible illness,and my wife gets distressed on my bad days, so why don\u2019t these people ask whatlife is like in real terms and not what the textbooks say. What is morealthough there are around half a dozen typesof dementia, there are as I understand it over 120 variations, which isstaggering, but this explains why it is so hard to diagnose, as no two peoplewith one form of the illness share the same symptoms and problems. I have adear friend, who has Lewy Body Dementia like me, but his symptoms are totallydifferent to mine, and I find it very hard to accept that he can remember somuch of his work yet I cannot. I always remember being at a conference and hearing awell-known and respected professor in Dementia saying, that although he isclassed as being at the top of his field, he is always amazed that each time hetakes a clinic he learns more about the illness. So if he can come out withcomments like this it certainly makes some in the NHS and the Civil Servicelook total idiots for not listening.I only hope that before too much time has passed, allgovernment departments will treat all illness the same and will shareinformation rather than doing their own thing, not only will this save vastsums of money but it will also save time and also help those who really needthe help when they need it and not later as we have seen in many cases",

Because like it or not assistive technology coversall the things used today, whether it is a mobile phone, Dictaphone, hearingaids, computers, walking sticks, chair lifts, the list is far too long tomention.I have also been toldby people in the social services on two occasions, that it is against the civilliberties of people with dementia to have to use this type of thing.But it is my opinion that when you get this type ofdiagnosis you then loose your civil liberty\u2019s as you then have to rely onothers.Assistive technology comes in various forms, and most ofthis equipment is there to help us to retain our freedom and independence foras long as possible, without others feeling the need to be watching us every minuteof the day.One of these things used quite often is a form of trackingdevice which allows the person, with dementia to carry on taking walks unaided.Most of these can be tracked on a standard computer, in a similar way to thatused by some parents who wish to track their children, by tracking the positionof the mobile phone using a computer.While most mobile phones can be tracked this way, some ofthe older phones do not have this facility.I personally find nothing wrong with this as I have my freedom.Another device which I find useful is voice activatedsoftware, which is loaded onto my computer and allows me to dictate what ever Iwish to the computer and it types it all out. This is very helpful to me as there are days when I struggleto use the computer keyboard, and although it is extremely odd watching themachine type the words you are speaking, it has removed a lot of the dailystress.But I would advice everyone to go and see what is availableon the market to make your lives that little bit easier",

That's all well and good when you have a good memory, butwhen you have a memory that does what it wants to, it causes problems to theowner.I have a routine that I try to stick to on my own, but whenthings change this causes many problems especially when it comes to takingtablets. I always take my tablets after straight breakfast, straightafter lunch and then straight after tea. I say \"straight\" after for agood reason, because if anything disrupts me, I am in a mess, because Icompletely forget the tablets and carry on as if nothing had changed.There have been times when this has happened at breakfastand then lunch, and then by tea time I realize that I have not had any tabletsthat day.My wife used to get very upset with me, but then sherealized that it was just the way things work, and she now checks to see if Ihave taken them. But like all careers, she has a hectic life and she can alsoforget when she is tired.I also find it hard when using my inhalers, because I tendto forget at times which ones I have use, and no matter which way I do it, itstill causes me grief.Going on holiday can also cause problems to routines,because at home I always find it easier to shave after breakfast when I feelmore awake. Where, when we are at a hotel I always feel that I should get ashave before showing my face outside the room.The problem is that this then throws my routine out of linecompletely.

        "content": "Dementia and hearing problemsDementia is bad enough without reactions extra problems with hearing. Afterbeing diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia, I noticed that I was having extraproblems associated with background noise which can be distressing at times.I did mention all of this to my last consultant who said it was all part ofthe Lewy Bodies Dementia, but now I feel that there are times when it isgetting so bad that I don\u2019t want to travel anywhere, as the excess noise ontrains etc is getting too much for me.I do have problems hearing what is being said by the person in front of me,when other people in the same room are talking, and this can lead to mestanding with a finger in one ear to get over this. However this can make me look as if I am not listening, to what the personis saying. Sometimes I turn my head sideways, so that my ear is pointing directly atthe person speaking, but there again it looks as if I am not taking any noticeof those speaking to me.I now find that if I am traveling on a train I need to take my MP3 playerwhich has large earphones on, so that all noise is masked by the music. Howeverthis does have a down side, as I can not hear my wife or anyone else who speaksto me. I sometimes find that I can hear so much of this background noise, that whensomeone walks up behind me to go past, I tend to jump a mile with shock, whichcan be even more embarrassing to all concerned.Recently someone suggested that I use ear plugs, but this will cut all thenoise out completely and could be rather unsafe when I am traveling.There are added problems these days with all the loud music when you enter ashop, it is so loud that you can not think or understand what is being said.When I was working, there were regulations governing noise, to ensure thateveryone was safe\u2026 however this does not seem to work in shop.Sometimes something like a bag of crisps being opened is like a hangover, asit seems to be so loud.And we go to the opposite end when Air conditioning makes life hard, as itis humming away in the background. I am going to speak to my GP tomorrow, as I understand that there may besome sort of device on the market which helps cut down this background noise. After a few tests at the audiology department, I have been fitted with twohearing aids, and the difference is remarkable as I can now hear clearly, and Ido not struggle with the background noise.This has now changed my life, as I no longer jump when something passes mein the town, so this has all been totally worth it.",

        "content": "Until the last year I had occasional slips but never gave it a lot ofthought. But over the last few months I have noticed that when I am going uphill, or I am getting tired, I am starting to trip a lot more, and it is onlywhen people like my wife or son are around that I am stopped from hitting theground.I have realised that I am not lifting my feet as much as I used to do, andperhaps that is the problem. Occasionally it is also caused by uneven paving orramps that I just don't see till its too late. Many shopping malls these days have ramps occasionally which we don'texpect, in places like that, and that causes problems to many. I think part of my problem is also caused by my osteoarthritis, and I wasgiven a walking stick by the hospital physio, but my own GP, said that I shouldnot use it, so I don't know who to believe.My wife is always says that I should use the stick, but who do you believe?any more, but like all men, I feel as if my pride is too big to allow me to dothe obvious.However I can understand just how people with dementia fall as much as theydo. I know that I sometimes see things on the ground that are not there, butthat is due to the brain doing things, and this sometimes makes us step overthings that are not there, or we just don't see the obvious as most normalpeople do. I am not saying that people with this illness are not normal,because we are, its just our brain is doing its own thing, and it gets annoyingand very frustrating at times.But perhaps this is why there are so many falls in care homes etc, and noone is taking any notice of the problems faced, by what I think is spacialawareness, and also possibly problems with our eyes.",

        "content": "Today we are living in the world of assistive technology, a totallydifferent world to what many of us were used to and something that many of usnever expected in the future, and like it or not we are in it whether we wantit or not.Assistive technology covers a very wide spectrum, and many simply do notappreciate its use in modern times.We get so used to hearing about street and traffic cameras which monitor us,but we never consider that this technology goes even further, as it takes onthings like hearing aids, lap top computers, and lastly mobile phones, thingswhich can be monitored by those with the knowledge, so they know exactly whatwe are watching doing and listening to at any given time.There are also many things which are used to enhance a person\u2019s life whenthey have a long term illness, such as computer voice activated software,which allows the person to speak normally in front of the computer, and theycan then sit back and watch the computer write down exactly what has been said.Yet many people assume quite wrongly these days, that a person with Dementiacan not use assistive technology. Many still tend to forget that people are being diagnosed at an early stagethese days and therefore anything that can enhance their lives, and promotethat extra bit of freedom and independence is well worth considering. All wewant is to be free and active for a bit longer, without having to rely on otherpeople for support, something that will come eventually, and then we will notbe allowed to enjoy this freedom. I have heard quite a few people say that these gadgets should not besupplied as they do away with our civil liberties, they never consider for onemoment, that when we are diagnosed with this illness we tend to lose our socalled civil liberties.So why is it so very wrong for us to use gadgets that are open to all in themodern world. You simply don\u2019t have to go far these days to see assistive technologyopenly being used by everyone around, and yet many of these people use it justfor show, to prove to others that they may be able to keep in contact withother people whether it is on a boat, train or plane, they don\u2019t really need itits just for show.Yet thousands of people need support with this type of equipment in one wayor another because of their illness, but they don\u2019t flaunt it and only use itwhen the time comes.One of the things used quite often is a form of tracking device which allowsthe person, with dementia to carry on taking walks unaided. Most of these canbe tracked on a standard computer when needed, in a similar way to that used bysome parents who wish to track their children, by tracking the position of themobile phone using a computer. Our own County Council is now piloting a schemeallowing people to use and assess these gadgets, which tend to be expensive forthe public to buy, and that is wonderful. I find nothing wrong in their use, asthey are in fact no different to carrying a standard mobile phone around. Thesatellite tracks the person, and no one else knows where they are until thepanic button is pressed. Once that has happened the tracking and monitoringstation, sends out a signal to either the County Council or the Carer, and theycan then go out and retrieve the person carrying the deviceAnother item mentioned earlier, is the voice activated software forcomputers. This allows those with memory problems to do things like lifestories, independent of others, simply by speaking to the computer. There maybe problems with corrections or local accents, but with support, this can bedone without to much stress. I confess that when I first did this, I wasspooked a little at seeing the computer write down everything I was saying, butafter a while I forgot about it, as it may life so much more easier to control.I personally find nothing wrong with this as I have my freedom.I am also now on a trial with a Buddy tracking device through our CountyCouncil, the idea is that by using these we will be able to to carry on living anormal life without needing the support of my wife and family, or having themworrying about me when I am out walking. These devices are monitored by thecounty council carers service who also have my wifes contact details, foremergencies.This service also allows the council to monitor the devices to see if theycould be used by others with this illness. They are already heavily involvedwith using and supplying assistive technology devices to those in need aroundthe county and this will be an extra device if successful bearing in mind thatthe terrain in this area is not always good for mobile signals.But I would advise everyone to go and see what is available on the market tomake life that bit easier.",
